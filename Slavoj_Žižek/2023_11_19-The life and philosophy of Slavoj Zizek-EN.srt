1
00:00:00,672 --> 00:00:04,009
Thanks very much for coming, and welcome to this talk.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,505
Delighted to be talking to Slavoj Zizek.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:12,829
He is the iconoclastic philosopher of our time, known for giving voice to the profound, the absurd, and everything in between.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,468
Among his many books are The Sublime Object of Ideology,

5
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:28,004
Living in the End Times, and more recently, Pandemic, as well as Hegel in a Wired Brain, and Surplus Enjoyment, a guide for the non perplexed, really critical difference.

6
00:00:28,932 --> 00:00:39,067
And he tells me he's now got three more books emerging in the autumn, including Freedom, A Disease Without Cure and Too Late to Awaken, is that the other term?

7
00:00:39,611 --> 00:00:46,020
So what we'll do is we'll have 30 minutes where we will talk and then we'll turn for a Q&A with about 15 minutes for that.

8
00:00:47,211 --> 00:00:50,829
So in terms of the life and work, yeah, there's this question about life.

9
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:59,105
Slavoj, should we start with often very, very driven people have a deep lying, underlying trauma as we were discussing.

10
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:00,641
So what is your trauma?

11
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,164
In some sense, I'm not kidding.

12
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:04,743
Life itself.

13
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,027
I don't think I existed before theory.

14
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:18,968
And I'm so corrupted that even when I watch a movie or read a novel, my mind is always, how can I use it in my theory afterwards?

15
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,949
And I notice details.

16
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:30,846
For example, did you see that it's not so good, but it's based on video game, the first season of the series, The Last of Us, post acapelipity.

17
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,163
For me, of course, as a leftist.

18
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:45,889
I think it's episode five, where the two, father figure and the girl walker, and enter a city which is well organized in these survivalist terms.

19
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,962
They share everything.

20
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:54,268
And then, I don't know who, I think Pedro Pascal, the guy, but you have communism here.

21
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,088
And they simply say, yes, so what, we have communism, yes.

22
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:59,324
And I think this is what we will need.

23
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:10,047
If things go on like this, look at you here in England, you are now almost as bad and without in Slovenia, public health service and so on, everything collapsing.

24
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,448
And just imagine a new crisis of whatever sort.

25
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:29,010
It's clearly that the market will not do it, that we will need, I'm a communist pessimist, we will need more some kind of a war communism, emergency state, but I'm losing time.

26
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:30,589
No, no, you're not, that's really important.

27
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:37,986
So I want to ask you about the end, because you've been writing for a long time, you were talking about melancholia and how you quite like it because it is the end.

28
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:45,325
And there are virtues to ends where something emerges, but then if it's just a total collapse, then that's a bad idea.

29
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,406
And in surplus enjoyment, you've turned to that living in the end times, which is quite some time ago you were talking about it.

30
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,606
So to ask you a question you ask in Hegel in A Wired Brain,

31
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:00,105
Are we living in a dystopian time or a time of dystopian fantasies, or both?

32
00:03:01,273 --> 00:03:05,508
It's a very good question because this difference is crucial.

33
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,745
The only way I can account for it, let me be precise, which difference?

34
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:16,505
Precisely, are we really more or less approaching some kind of end?

35
00:03:17,311 --> 00:03:23,806
Or is it just that in a strange way we are obsessed by the end?

36
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,470
I think both are true, but not in the sense of harmony.

37
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,428
The explanation I have is that we, at the same time,

38
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:40,369
we live in an era of what I call, following my conservative German friend, Peter Sloterdijk,

39
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:48,566
we live in an era of cynical reason, where, you know, in the old times, the survival worked like this.

40
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:54,065
You knew something is true, but you pretend that it's not true.

41
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,588
And you, or you try to explain it away and so on.

42
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:06,067
Now we are entering a new era, I have in my next book, but also can impress later, of science,

43
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:11,470
where we learned, we, those in power, not me,

44
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:18,184
we learned how to tell objectively at the level of facts the truth,

45
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,642
But this very fact immobilizes us.

46
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:32,600
Precisely, the fact of talking about it instead of mobilizing us makes us apathetic, inefficient, and so on.

47
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,046
For example, even at the level of art, because I'm here, not at the other place.

48
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,190
Is there another place in Davis?

49
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:40,728
I don't know.

50
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:41,309
I can't remember.

51
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,767
Yeah, also.

52
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,079
I forgot.

53
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:49,846
Because if there is a thing I hate, and one of the things where I am tempted to act as a terrorist, like a bomb there.

54
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:55,490
It's this big art biennales, Venice Castle and so on.

55
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,306
Did you notice something about them?

56
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:05,848
How, in their programmatic notes to begin with, they say we are all under capitalism,

57
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:11,180
we are part of exploitation, Eurocentric, racist, blah, blah, blah.

58
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:22,987
And then they go on, and the way Castle and Venice functions are perfect examples of pure capitalist commercialization of art.

59
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:29,888
You see the paradox, you are telling it what it is and instead of preventing you, it goes on.

60
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:40,447
Wasn't the same with, no, it was a little bit north two years ago when you remember the Glasgow Conference on Prince, now no longer just Prince.

61
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:52,769
Charles was there and in some stupid sense, Although it's not, he basically told the truth, bread danger, blah, blah, blah, but nothing came out of it.

62
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,227
And this is very close to me, now I enter.

63
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,666
This is as much as you will get from me about life.

64
00:05:59,531 --> 00:06:02,787
I know that stance because I have it.

65
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,665
It's the obsession neurotic stance.

66
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,149
You talk all the time, not to achieve something,

67
00:06:11,611 --> 00:06:15,087
but to make it sure that nothing will happen.

68
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:24,208
That's why another detail from life, when I was 50 years ago, 40, in psychoanalysis, you can imagine how it looked.

69
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:31,867
It was a Lacanian psychoanalysis, which means I could be sure that the session will not last more than five, seven minutes.

70
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,287
So I talked all the time.

71
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:34,936
Why?

72
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,087
Because I was afraid that if I stop talking for a second,

73
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,028
the analyst will ask me some really embarrassing questions.

74
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:52,370
So you see, this idea of being active to make it sure that nothing will really change, happen.

75
00:06:52,772 --> 00:07:02,749
Can I posit a kind of devil's advocate on that, though, that is it possible, but by talking about the apocalypse, it becomes something that occurs?

76
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,122
I mean, do you bring it into being,

77
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:14,679
by everybody saying we're in an apocalypse, it's happening, it's going, and then so whenever there's apocalyptic possibility that's immediately grasped and we kind of incite ourselves into an apocalypse.

78
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:29,670
I know I know I know the question but I'm not sure if it functions like that I think it's more this idea if we talk enough about it life will somehow magically just life will just go on

79
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:38,186
that's why some of you will widely disagree with me because even some Some leftists ask me, are you crazy?

80
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,287
How can you support Ukraine?

81
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,448
You support NATO, you support Western imperialism and so on.

82
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:47,923
Well, this is a very strange thing.

83
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:53,367
I go into it with my Too Late to Awaken book.

84
00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:02,729
I tell them, first, I passively speak Russian and my brains are not washed by Western propaganda about Ukraine.

85
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:03,546
Sorry.

86
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:12,328
listening to Russian media all the time, and it's absolutely horrible what I read there.

87
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:17,784
So which is why I'm jumping, but here we are to jump here and there.

88
00:08:17,784 --> 00:08:25,345
Another thing that I hate absolutely is this pseudo-deep proverb, you know, apparently multiculturalist.

89
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:32,949
The enemy is somebody whose side, whose truth, whose story you were not able to listen to.

90
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,201
Are you crazy?

91
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:44,049
Okay, this applies maybe to small neighborly conflicts, but when you say Hitler is our enemy because we are not ready to listen to his story.

92
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,048
I mean, I did, I read Mein Kampf, a very boring book.

93
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,668
And you are even more horrified there.

94
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,983
On the other hand, I think that, of course, we always have a story.

95
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:03,967
But in politics, it's not that you enact a story.

96
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:16,008
It's that you do something horrible, and the big problem is to invent a story which covers it up, which allows you to live with the horror.

97
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:25,627
And I think, unfortunately, and my Japanese friends even agree with me here, that that's the case with so-called Western Buddhism, but the same there.

98
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:41,589
No wonder that, so I read, the most popular spiritual religious, if you call it, but it's not, orientation of big corporate guys today is some kind of a vague pseudo-oriental spiritualism.

99
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,890
Because it's wonderful.

100
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,290
You do all the dirty things, people losing jobs, killing.

101
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,370
And then you tell yourself, but what is this?

102
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,787
But isn't life just a fleeting appearance?

103
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,847
The truth is in me, and so on, and so on.

104
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:58,705
I mean, if you have, I respect Buddhism, especially Zen Buddhism.

105
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:09,701
But this was, for me, the sobering, one of my, how should I call it, grounding, again, fucking Clive, we are coming back, life experiences.

106
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:24,143
When I read a book, I quoted, Brian Victoria, he is a Japanese, although this type of name, Zen and War, Zen War, something like that.

107
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:36,329
It describes how almost all of them, there were a couple of million Zen establishment, apart from four or five dissidents, totally supported the Japanese Imperial War.

108
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:44,528
You know, if you are old enough, the big guy popularizer of Zen dies at the tower of Suzuki, Suzuki from hippie times.

109
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:47,928
Yeah, but look at his earlier writings, you know.

110
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:54,369
In late 30s, he wrote a long justification of the Japanese attack on China.

111
00:10:54,691 --> 00:11:02,929
Not only this, he collaborated with the army because he proposed them a theory with a terrifying example, but which is the truth.

112
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:03,945
I appreciate him.

113
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,367
He said, sorry, let's say you are my enemy.

114
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:09,388
We meet in the battlefield.

115
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,485
The fight is primitive, I have a knife.

116
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:15,269
Nonetheless, I'm not totally evil.

117
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:20,346
I would find it a little bit problematic to stick my knife into you.

118
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,606
And he confronts this problem, Suzuki.

119
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,928
And he says Zen Buddhism has a solution here.

120
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:40,428
You must go through that, you can call it nirvana, whatever, the zero experience, enlightenment, where you see there is no substantial reality.

121
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:42,387
You are not really active.

122
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:47,648
You are just an empty brain observing the crazy dance of phenomena.

123
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:55,649
So Suzuki, I'm quoting him, he says, so it's not I as a person will stick my knife into you.

124
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,168
That's painful, I'm still human at some level.

125
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,506
But you should have said, I'm observing a phenomenon,

126
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:11,488
phenomenal multiplicity where my knife is dancing in the air and somehow it gets stuck into your breast.

127
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,447
and I can kindly leave it.

128
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:14,559
So, you know, no.

129
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:21,269
But let's talk about paradox as well, because that's really fundamental to your writing and to Zen, in fact, that idea of paradox.

130
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:32,186
And in terms also of, I mean, you've talked, and you're sort of talking about it at the moment, you've said that recently things have changed with ideology, that you were saying until now, ideology was just a lie,

131
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,964
but now it's a more cynical thing in a very precise sense that you know what you're doing.

132
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,228
I would call it lie in the guise of truth.

133
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:48,985
But what does this do then to the old enlightenment mind, this idea that everyone is a kind of, which you've written about as well, that we're sort of rational actors and we can make these decisions

134
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:51,349
if you're in this kind of total paradise?

135
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:57,288
I remain fully, although many people would not believe me, a guy of enlightenment.

136
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:06,166
What I'm saying is not that since rational argumentation doesn't work,

137
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,385
then whatever, just violence or do nothing and so on, no.

138
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:21,808
I think that there are different even strategies of speaking, where you can undermine this stance.

139
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,046
And I even, in one of my earlier books, I forgot which one, there are too many of them,

140
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:35,583
I elaborated this how every apparently cynical guy, usually you have a fetish, an exception.

141
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,410
And there is where you have to attach it.

142
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,147
Maybe some of you know this example that I used years ago.

143
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:44,704
It's real life, very stupid.

144
00:13:46,052 --> 00:13:51,066
A friend of mine, this was 30 years ago, 20,

145
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:57,449
had a wife who was, sorry for this sexist sounding, but beautiful young, they loved each other all you want.

146
00:13:57,751 --> 00:14:04,248
And then all of a sudden in her mid-20s, she got breast cancer and it was too late.

147
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,507
She died in two months, horrible.

148
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:17,068
And we were so surprised that the guy, the husband, just went on functioning like normally,

149
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:23,447
talked even about the last moments of his wife, and then something happened.

150
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,709
His wife had a preferred pet object, a small hamster.

151
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,683
Half a year later, this hamster died.

152
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,189
The guy immediately tried to kill him.

153
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,504
You know, hamster was his fetish.

154
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:47,908
It embodied like the wife somehow as a fetish, it was a disavowal of his wife's death.

155
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:56,186
So it was at that point that he totally broke down, he had to be for one month on a, how do you call it, suicide watch, you know.

156
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,842
Always somebody with him.

157
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:15,994
And tomorrow, to make a little bit of propaganda, at my speech about surplus enjoyment, enjoyment or maybe even at the theological debate in the afternoon, I will go into another forum of this.

158
00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:32,030
I was so fascinated with the figure of Heinrich Himmler, SS boss, who was formally, formally as to form, an extremely ethical guy.

159
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,388
Never heard, but he organized Holocaust.

160
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,947
But for him, this was the highest ethical act.

161
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:48,285
And you know, he used a terrifying reversal here, this cynicism at its purest.

162
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:51,587
He admitted it, this is horrible.

163
00:15:52,111 --> 00:15:54,666
How can we, decent Germans,

164
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,748
Do this, killing Jewish children,

165
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,808
we mean not even, and remain decent.

166
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,463
You know what was his answer?

167
00:16:05,191 --> 00:16:06,408
Oriental spiritualism.

168
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:14,606
He always was carrying in his pocket a special leather copy of Bhagavad Gita,

169
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:23,107
where you have this idea, you know, the king is convinced to go into battle, saying life is an appearance, the main thing is to do your duty.

170
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:29,025
And the really horrible thing, You find the same rhetorical trick in Stalinism with Trump today.

171
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:38,430
It's, we all have, as I used it in my example, you know, this, I call it basic common sense decency.

172
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:46,287
Like, certain thing you may, I don't, dream about them, I'm not saying I don't have dirty dreams, just not that kind.

173
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:48,550
But that's not part of the life conversation.

174
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:49,389
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,229
Or maybe it is, I don't know.

176
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,829
No, no, no, what I don't, don't be afraid.

177
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:59,258
No, no, no, what I just wanted to say is that The problem of Hitler is how do you remain sane and so on.

178
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,647
And he operates a very dirty trick.

179
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,489
He says that every idiot can be decent and fight for his country.

180
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:21,008
But true patriotism is that you are ready to do horrible things for your country.

181
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:26,424
And I discovered in how they were making propaganda for collectivization in 1930s, early 30s,

182
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:33,903
when they collectivized and millions died of hunger in Russia, and I found the same figure.

183
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:45,890
They said, you will see horrible things, peasant farmers, families starving and so on, but your decency is the greatest temptation to evil.

184
00:17:46,392 --> 00:17:49,545
If you're a true Bolshevik, you go on killing.

185
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,789
And this horrible ethics is returning to David Trump.

186
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:54,338
But no.

187
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,521
Yes, yes.

188
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,530
I want to ask you a bit in terms of appearances as well that we take for realities.

189
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:03,769
And I was thinking about Hegel in A Wired Brain where you're talking all about Hegel

190
00:18:04,271 --> 00:18:13,569
and subjectivity and how Hegelian notions of subjectivity might relate to this kind of strange world we're now in where for the first time, you know,

191
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:22,193
the Russians wanted to do this in the Soviet Union, but now we actually begin to have this technology where where we can create these strange singularities,

192
00:18:22,217 --> 00:18:28,817
which you write about where brain-computer interfaces can link brains into this potentially, yes, potentially.

193
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:32,348
Of course, it's still sci-fi, but the beginnings of these kinds of technologies.

194
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:33,649
And I want to ask you about that.

195
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,548
How then does that change to you, the notion first of subjectivity, which you write about,

196
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,390
and also these ideas of free will, autonomy, in terms of who's controlling the brain-computer interface?

197
00:18:43,511 --> 00:18:45,369
I don't want to lose too much time.

198
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:57,569
So as to freedom, I try to provide in the first chapter of my freedom book, which will be out by Bloomsbury in the fall, I try to, the point is how to,

199
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:09,350
in facing the neurobiological, however you call it, determinism, how to, under quotation marks, save freedom.

200
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:16,207
Because I agree with some determinists like the German lady Sabine Hossenfelder.

201
00:19:16,671 --> 00:19:17,649
She's very intelligent.

202
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,670
She said that, she even doesn't argue.

203
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:26,466
She said that the moment you accept naturalism, there simply is no space for freedom.

204
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,467
Freedom is a subjective concept.

205
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,407
So how to save freedom?

206
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:46,909
My answer is not that it's freedom already there in nature, but that the first thing to do is to open up nature, not in the sense of higher spirituality,

207
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:53,805
but in the sense that nature is in itself ontologically incomplete open.

208
00:19:54,790 --> 00:20:00,289
Not only human, sorry, not only human culture, but nature.

209
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,648
What do I mean by ontological openness?

210
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:12,989
For example, here I always opposed historicism, which says, for example, classical example, I use it often in books, to really understand Shakespeare,

211
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,762
you have to know the details of Elizabethan England and so on.

212
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,589
My idea is not to really understand Shakespeare.

213
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:23,067
Shakespeare didn't understand himself.

214
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,008
His work was full of inconsistencies, incomplete.

215
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,829
And if you come later, it's not an obstacle.

216
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:37,084
You can even understand Shakespeare better than he understood himself.

217
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:45,646
And so in some sense, we are not just reading Shakespeare differently.

218
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,810
We are literally completing his work.

219
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:53,590
That's how I hate the official dogma of multiculturalism.

220
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,328
But I respect it when you really get it.

221
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,067
For example, maybe some of you heard this.

222
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:04,841
I find it so wonderful that the best Shakespeare cinema version that I know.

223
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,583
It's done by Akira Kurosawa, 61 or two.

224
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,930
The version of Hamlet set in contemporary Japan.

225
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,549
Hamlet is a Japanese student returning from the United States.

226
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,667
His father was a big corporate boss.

227
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:22,368
But it, and it has a wonderful title, this movie.

228
00:21:22,951 --> 00:21:24,808
Only bad people sleep well.

229
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,927
It's a wonderful title.

230
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:27,782
They don't care.

231
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,923
But what I want to say is that I am ready,

232
00:21:32,451 --> 00:21:34,106
Maybe I'm speculating too much.

233
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:39,164
I'm now trying to study in detail as much as I can understand.

234
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:52,649
Quantum physics, because I think what you find at the bottom of quantum physics is this idea of ontologically incomplete universe, in the sense that, in what sense?

235
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:54,189
Sorry, give me two minutes.

236
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:57,389
It's an old story, but I like to repeat it of mine.

237
00:21:58,895 --> 00:22:02,409
because it links to the previous debate at video games.

238
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:08,168
Look, the first thing about video games is that their universe is incomplete.

239
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:19,046
You're in a game, stupid game, where you are shooting, fighting on the main street of a small town, let us say, and in the back you see forest with trees.

240
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:26,889
But it's not part of the game that you can approach those trees and see them in detail.

241
00:22:27,812 --> 00:22:29,769
It's part of the game, did you ever go there?

242
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,949
So the programmer say, why lose time on that programming?

243
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:35,384
Let's leave it open.

244
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:42,525
And the way, I got this from a popular introduction to philosophy, sorry, forgot the name, but very intelligently, I think written.

245
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:48,587
The guy says, is not quantum physics, does it not have the same lesson?

246
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:55,508
When God was programming the universe, he said, people are too stupid to reach beyond the atom.

247
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,149
so why should I bother their programming?

248
00:22:58,411 --> 00:22:59,927
He lived it undetermined.

249
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:07,827
And we were a little bit too bright for God, and we, as you say in English, caught God with his pants down, as it were.

250
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:08,657
You know?

251
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,230
And in fact, do you then believe then, or are you positing in terms of that argument?

252
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:20,130
So are you saying, or maybe it's not possible, within quantum physics this question, is reality discrete or continuous?

253
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:30,249
So is reality like Minecraft, where you kind of zoom in further and further and further, and then you get, as you say, down further, further to these tiny little, you know, to the leptons, and further and further down.

254
00:23:30,391 --> 00:23:32,459
Is that a view that you're a little sympathetic to?

255
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:35,987
I spontaneously, but I don't have any empirical ground for this.

256
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:45,446
I am for discrete nature in mod sense, and I think this is almost maybe the lesson of quantum physics, but I'm very much speculating now.

257
00:23:46,111 --> 00:23:52,666
I think that it's not this endless divisibility you can further split that.

258
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:59,484
At certain point, I can split this in half, this and that, this and that.

259
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:06,305
But I believe when you approach the zero point, the division is between something and nothing.

260
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:11,988
You see, you get something, its counterpoint is void, is nothing.

261
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:19,506
And so I'm not saying this is bad metaphysical reading of that in this freedom is grounded.

262
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,668
No, first, freedom is not contingency.

263
00:24:24,712 --> 00:24:31,408
It's not my free act if I, but even this is not, of course, it's deterministic, but let's say for me it's a contingency.

264
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,689
It's to make a decision, I throw a coin up and set hat tail or whatever.

265
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:40,228
No, that's contingency from my view, really it's not.

266
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,789
But freedom is a necessity of its own.

267
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,167
Freedom is a positive decision that you do.

268
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:51,166
Is this only, as they say, user's illusion?

269
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:53,928
I think not.

270
00:24:54,250 --> 00:25:03,327
I think we have to, it's more important than ever, we have to accept this ontological openness of nature already, of history.

271
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:10,448
For example, we are now in an open situation, and retroactively it will become necessary.

272
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:13,007
If there will be a world war,

273
00:25:14,331 --> 00:25:16,788
if there will be people who will survive it,

274
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:22,061
They will tell the story of how it was all pointed towards this war.

275
00:25:23,411 --> 00:25:24,423
We were doomed.

276
00:25:25,051 --> 00:25:30,087
If there will not be a war, they will say, oh, it was like Cold War, false alarms, and so on.

277
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,509
What I'm claiming is that these are not simply illusions.

278
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,829
The situation is genuinely open.

279
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:50,509
And another lesson, which I know it's not legitimate, I applied too quickly from quantum physics to humanities, nonetheless, is that to understand something, a historical event,

280
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:57,526
you should read it in a superposition with other possible events.

281
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:09,330
When something happens, you should always ask yourself what other options failed so that this could have happened.

282
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:15,590
So in this way, back to our point immediately, My point in Wirebrained is a more optimistic one.

283
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,766
It's not just dark end of humanity.

284
00:26:18,331 --> 00:26:30,647
I try to, and it's so interesting that nobody likes those final concluding chapter, where I try to do exactly this, to ask this absolutely naive question.

285
00:26:31,331 --> 00:26:32,666
Maybe it's even the wrong question.

286
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:40,087
Let's say that this, self-objectivization, in the sense of a machine which can read our mind.

287
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,785
Let's say that it more or less succeeds.

288
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:45,379
We have it.

289
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:50,208
Does this mean that we no longer exist as subjects?

290
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,687
My answer is an optimist one there.

291
00:26:53,110 --> 00:27:02,027
First, by subject we should not understand this inner wealth of personality, but the pure Cartesian subjectivity.

292
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:06,548
That empty space will remain supported in what?

293
00:27:06,731 --> 00:27:07,705
In the unconscious.

294
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:11,969
Because I have here quite an unconscious for me.

295
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,805
It's not deep ingrained in our brain.

296
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:27,685
Think about unconscious as just some kind of a purely symbolic virtual entity, something that exists, not materially, really.

297
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:33,944
But just as a, like, we have three, four versions that we think about.

298
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,346
But to account for these versions,

299
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:41,949
You have in your symbolic space to presuppose another option.

300
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,629
And unconscious is, in this sense, purely virtual.

301
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:52,269
You know, you must have heard, maybe even here, two years ago when I repeated this story about wonderful anecdote.

302
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,190
It's overused from the movie Ninotzka.

303
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:59,326
You know, a guy goes to a cafeteria and bring me coffee.

304
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,389
He said, can I get coffee but without cream?

305
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,348
And the waiter answers correctly.

306
00:28:05,632 --> 00:28:06,047
Sorry, sir.

307
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,587
We don't have cream, only milk.

308
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,583
So can I give you coffee without milk?

309
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:15,249
That's in the, let's say consciousness is what I see.

310
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,768
In any case, I get just plain coffee.

311
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:23,546
But it's a big difference if it's coffee without milk or coffee without cream.

312
00:28:23,851 --> 00:28:25,289
You will say I'm bullshitting.

313
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:26,764
No, think about feminism.

314
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:32,743
Isn't the big change in the history of feminism where women got it dead.

315
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:40,227
Women who suffer, what they are deprived of is not milk but cream, if I can put it like this.

316
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:49,507
That is to say that it's not that they have a prescribed place in the symbolic space and that maybe if the husband is too brutal, no death.

317
00:28:50,091 --> 00:28:56,049
That what they are deprived of, their freedom and so on, needs a more radical shift.

318
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:11,104
So the first step in feminism, and I got this from Judith Butler, with whom I have many polymics, but I agree with her here, is to first, to clearly formulate what you are deprived of.

319
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:16,528
It's not enough to say, oh, my husband doesn't give me enough money and so on, blah, blah, blah.

320
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:26,588
No, you have to say the whole system which puts my husband, if we are living in traditional patriarchal society, is wrong.

321
00:29:27,151 --> 00:29:32,708
So to conclude, not with that long joke, I will tell you another thing, did you see Francois?

322
00:29:33,422 --> 00:29:33,586
Yeah.

323
00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:36,198
No time.

324
00:29:37,214 --> 00:29:37,644
My God.

325
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,830
Look, and they see, they think we live in free society.

326
00:29:41,971 --> 00:29:42,545
No, no.

327
00:29:43,173 --> 00:29:44,947
We live in oppressive society.
