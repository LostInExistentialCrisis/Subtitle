1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:02,550
Thank you very much.

2
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:07,900
Thanks to everyone for coming, and you know, I hope it doesn't get too hot in here.

3
00:00:09,316 --> 00:00:12,250
We're going to talk today about moral facts and moral fantasies.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,633
Once the fashion of a postmodern age,

5
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:26,916
moral relativism has always had its detractors, not only mainstream analytic philosophers, but in particular those with a religious bent.

6
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:36,450
But now there's a new breed of celebrity thinkers, this time with an atheist bent, from Sam Harris to the late Derek Parfit to Peter Singer.

7
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,916
They're making claims for the existence of an absolute set of moral truths,

8
00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:47,033
even though they would deride the strict moral codes of others like the Victorians.

9
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:52,266
Critics argue that like authoritarian moralists of the past,

10
00:00:53,566 --> 00:01:00,366
They use so-called objective morality to shore up their own prejudices and silence descent.

11
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:09,700
Should we welcome the return of objective morality as an antidote to the chaos and confusion of current ethics?

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,966
Or is it an authoritarian fantasy that needs to be excised before it gains further traction?

13
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:28,600
Or should we give up moral claims altogether in favor of a calm assessment of our social benefits and the threats of any given action?

14
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,433
I'm delighted to introduce our speakers.

15
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,183
First we have Slavoj Zizek.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,133
He's arguably the leading celebrity philosopher of our times.

17
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:44,233
Foreign policy named him a top 100 global thinker.

18
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:45,566
Only 100.

19
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:46,950
Only the top 100.

20
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,366
very low way

21
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:56,200
for giving voice to an air era of absurdity

22
00:01:56,216 --> 00:02:09,516
Simon Blackburn to my right, is an academic philosopher, known for his work on meta ethics, he's published over a dozen books on various philosophical issues, both for public and academic audiences,

23
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:20,200
and to my far left we have Joanna Kavanagh she's the author of many works of fiction and nonfiction including The Ice Museum, A Field Guide to Reality, and ZED.

24
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:28,450
She has won many awards for her writing, including the Orange Prize for New Writing, and the Granta Best of British Authors.

25
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:37,983
Okay, so without further ado, what I'd like to do now is to pose a question to each of our panelists, and they each get three minutes.

26
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,700
Three minutes, Slavoj, three minutes.

27
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,600
Sorry, I have some trouble hearing you.

28
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,016
I heard 30, but okay.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,233
to give us their reaction to the question.

30
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:48,900
Here's the question.

31
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:57,783
Should we welcome the return of an object of morality, or is it authoritarian fantasy?

32
00:02:58,133 --> 00:02:59,383
I'm gonna start with Slavoj.

33
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:04,716
Very briefly, I hope I will have some chance later to go on.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,483
First, it all depends on what you mean by objective morality and moral relativism.

35
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:17,050
I think there is a third term here.

36
00:03:17,616 --> 00:03:22,566
If I may even refer briefly to a philosopher with whom I didn't agree, Karl Popper.

37
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:25,900
You know he introduced the term of the third world.

38
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:40,733
Like objective facts of a symbolic order which in some sense are not part of external reality but nonetheless it's false to subjectivize them.

39
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,516
to say these are just emotions and so on.

40
00:03:45,116 --> 00:03:54,183
In this sense, I think morality, to work as morality, has to be minimally objective.

41
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:08,033
You cannot have morality for which you claim that it directly just expresses your attitude, your whatever, but just to give two, three hints into what direction I want to go,

42
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,950
There are big historical changes,

43
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:19,000
but I think that although there are many rules which in some way or other are common to different epochs,

44
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:29,816
what always fascinated me is that every objective system of not just morality but customs and so on,

45
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:38,216
always relies on unwritten, implicit unwritten rules rules, which are absolutely crucial.

46
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:48,000
And I will conclude with just two examples which are my favorite. One is, did you notice how often things are prohibited?

47
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,900
But the system itself, between the lines,

48
00:04:52,716 --> 00:04:56,166
solicits you to violate the prohibition.

49
00:04:56,533 --> 00:05:01,900
Like I had a very vulgar experience, sorry to fall so low, with my father when I was young,

50
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:07,016
he warned me against contacts to young with women and so on

51
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:10,500
and then he inquired, but did you already do it?

52
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:12,483
What kind of a man are you and so on?

53
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:29,550
So following this ambiguity and much more interesting with which I will conclude, the opposite version of things that we are solicited even to do, you can do it on condition that you don't do it.

54
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,483
For example, my favorite, okay,

55
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,000
ordinary and extreme example, then I stop.

56
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:39,900
Ordinary example, do you have, I'm not talking about the traitors, England,

57
00:05:40,316 --> 00:05:48,166
here in Wales, do you also have this manner, I invite you to dinner, and it's clear that I will pay.

58
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:53,083
But when the bill arrives, if I invited you,

59
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,700
you have to insist for some time, no, no, let's share it, and so on.

60
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,516
We both know that at the end I will pay.

61
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:08,166
But the guy has to make an offer which we know will be refused.

62
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,266
And my favorite example here is it really happened.

63
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,533
Sorry, old Stalinist Soviet Union.

64
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:22,833
In Soviet Union, it was not only of course prohibited to criticize Stalin.

65
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:29,850
it was even more prohibited to publicly announce this prohibition.

66
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,516
It happened at one session that the guy raised hand, Comrade Stalin is wrong here.

67
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,350
Then another guy raised his hand and said, are you crazy?

68
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,983
We don't speak like this here.

69
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,366
You don't criticize Stalin.

70
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,866
The second guy disappeared much faster than the first one.

71
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:50,100
You know, this is very elegant thing.

72
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:53,583
Prohibition itself is prohibited.

73
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,983
All this just to complicate things, thanks.

74
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,800
Brilliant, that does complicate things.

75
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:13,900
I'm going to turn things over now to Simon since you said, oh, we mustn't think of morality, moral claims, moral truths as expressions of attitudes we have.

76
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,516
Simon, what do you think of that?

77
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:18,400
Well, that's exactly how I do think about them.

78
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,983
Sorry, what?

79
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,983
There are expressions or you agree with me?

80
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,200
I don't think there's anything wrong with saying that morality is an expression of attitude.

81
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:37,233
It's not just your personal attitude usually, it's at least an attitude which you're soliciting other people to agree with.

82
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:44,433
So if I say that Boris Johnson's a bad thing, I think if I'm sincere which I would be.

83
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:54,000
It would be an expression of my attitude to the way he behaves but in expressing it I'm not simply emoting or sounding off.

84
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:57,200
The public act is partly one of trying to solicit agreement,

85
00:07:57,233 --> 00:08:12,566
and if you disagree with me I'd expect you to say why and then I'd say why I think he's a bad thing and we to and fro and the art, the point of that depends upon on arriving at this sort of social consensus.

86
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,100
Now we may know that we can't get social consensus.

87
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:21,466
I know that there are people in the Conservative Party,

88
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,000
Tory backbenchers who are not going to agree with me that Boris Johnson is a bad thing.

89
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:29,900
Not at least until he's lost his premiership.

90
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,483
Then they might start agreeing.

91
00:08:33,766 --> 00:08:38,500
But the point is to express an attitude and solicit agreement for that attitude.

92
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:42,116
Now, people say, ah, but where's the objectivity in that?

93
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:46,300
Well, objectivity is a very interesting word.

94
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:49,166
People think of morals as either objective or subjective.

95
00:08:50,216 --> 00:08:51,200
I don't think like that.

96
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:55,866
I think that an opinion becomes objective by being pursued objectively.

97
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:07,900
And that means by looking at the evidence, by being curious about what might bear on it, by even as Karl Popper used to emphasize,

98
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:16,866
being pleased to find refutations of it, being pleased to find things that don't entirely bear it out and which then force you to think again.

99
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:32,016
In other words, it's as if we've got an onboard critic which is itself worried about our own opinions and the desire to improve those opinions and to back them as best we can, that counts as objectivity.

100
00:09:32,816 --> 00:09:34,016
You all know that's okay.

101
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:35,816
If any of you are committed,

102
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:40,233
Suppose you're arrested for a crime which you didn't commit.

103
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,916
You're going to be praying that the police inquiry into it is objective.

104
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:56,933
So the point is it's the evidence finding, the curiosity, the willingness to be open-minded, which is the sign of objectivity.

105
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,600
And in that sense, some opinions are much more objective than others.

106
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,766
The opinion that Boris Johnson is a bad thing is entirely objective.

107
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:12,166
There's no conceivable descent from it, except from, well, people I've already mentioned.

108
00:10:12,516 --> 00:10:13,666
Have I gone on for three minutes?

109
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:14,716
Okay.

110
00:10:14,716 --> 00:10:14,833
Good.

111
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:15,933
Wonderful.

112
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,283
Okay.

113
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,000
So now let's have our novelist weigh in.

114
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:20,700
Joanna.

115
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:21,483
Thank you.

116
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,666
I'm just reminded of the old joke,

117
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,750
of course there are objective morals, whatever I say so.

118
00:10:26,816 --> 00:10:32,633
I mean, it's that kind of, within this intrinsic premise, there's a sort of incredible reasonable quorum here.

119
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,083
It's wonderful.

120
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,500
other world of authoritarian fantasy which you mentioned.

121
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:42,233
So I guess if we think about that, why in the debate is authoritarian fantasy being cited?

122
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:44,816
And this sort of adamantine view.

123
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:49,783
And I was thinking often when I think about morality, I remember this poem that W.B.Yeats wrote in 1919,

124
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:58,350
The Second Coming, and it's written just after the complete slaughter and carnage of World War I, this absolute apocalypse.

125
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:04,233
And he is talking about things fall apart, the center cannot hold, and mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.

126
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:06,750
But he also writes these weird lines which,

127
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:18,483
if you read them, I remember reading it for GCSE and I was this sort of passionate teenager and they say, the best lack all conviction and the worst are full of passionate intensity.

128
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,033
And you think, well surely it's really good to be passionate and intense.

129
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:26,550
And so, isn't that a good thing to feel passion and intensity?

130
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:27,866
Why would that be the worst?

131
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,050
And why would the best lack conviction?

132
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:38,116
And I think what Yeats means is the real maniacs who take control and say, we've got the absolute moral order sorted,

133
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:45,833
no one can demur, and everyone's got to do what we say because we're in touch with a sort of higher cause or power.

134
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,533
And they're the ones that in a way paradoxically drive everything into this kind of anarchy.

135
00:11:51,316 --> 00:12:02,083
And so as both my colleagues were saying, there's another tradition which is very ancient tradition of how do we live well, how do we live a good life, which goes way back to the earliest

136
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:09,516
philosophical literary text that we know of, one of the earliest, The Epic of Gilgamesh from 2000 years before Christ.

137
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:11,750
So it's a kind of debate that's gone on forever.

138
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:22,400
And then on the other side, you have this kind of maniacal fervor, this passionate intensity that goes into sort of febrile intensity and what that does to the debate.

139
00:12:23,016 --> 00:12:31,533
And of course, novelists are just sort of waffling around in the center somewhere trying to write these novels which express everything, this kind of whole gamut of views.

140
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:34,450
And I think Iris Murdoch had a good view of this.

141
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:41,700
She talked about that you need to express a moral position because otherwise you're into what Yates talks about.

142
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:43,016
You lose all conviction.

143
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:44,533
You lose heart.

144
00:12:44,616 --> 00:12:45,650
You can't do anything.

145
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,666
You can't do anything against these people with this fervor.

146
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:55,733
So she argued that you should try for a kind of openness, a porous moral position was her view.

147
00:12:56,433 --> 00:13:03,966
And Adrienne Rich said the same, that there's a moral responsibility in not allowing others to just talk and name everything for you.

148
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,416
You try and name and talk yourself, but you also try and let others do that as well.

149
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:20,900
So I'd argue fewer apocalypses, fewer maniacs, quite a lot of novels, if that's all right, and yeah, a sort of porous moral view of things.

150
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:21,666
Thanks.

151
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:23,333
Is that three minutes or more?

152
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:23,866
Far more?

153
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,166
Yeah, no, that's good, that's good.

154
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:25,933
Yeah, sorry, probably more.

155
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:34,250
I don't wanna be the time Nazi here, But OK, let's dig a little deeper, see if we can't sharpen what's being said.

156
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:37,150
Let me raise another question for you.

157
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,100
Is objective morality even possible?

158
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,283
I'd like to start with Joanna.

159
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:53,833
Well, so I think Simon was defining, he was saying, this idea of what we might define as in Popper's idea that Slavoj mentioned as well, this kind of symbolic order.

160
00:13:54,316 --> 00:14:02,950
Because otherwise, you get into this adamantine dictionary definition, which would be something that exists beyond feelings and judgment.

161
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:09,783
And actually, within a moral question, of course, our feelings and experiences and judgments are very fundamental to that.

162
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:16,466
So I think this question then of how would you divest your moral order from all feeling judgment?

163
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:19,716
I mean, when you meet someone, you feel, do I trust them?

164
00:14:20,716 --> 00:14:22,133
Is this something I want to talk to?

165
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:25,033
And you can be wrong.

166
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:35,450
So if you're thinking about moral texts like Pride and Prejudice, 1813, Austen, that's all about how you can meet someone and your judgment is wrong.

167
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:43,450
You know, Lizzie Bennet doesn't judge Darcy right at first because he's rude and he won't dance with her and he messes up her sister's love life.

168
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,600
So initially she thinks he's bad, but then she gets more information.

169
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:54,416
She makes a different judgment, but there's still the sort of sense of what might constitute a person is maintained,

170
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:58,866
these values that Slavoj was talking about that we do expect from others.

171
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,733
So I think if you mean something, the thing about this debate is,

172
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:14,483
and my philosophical colleagues should really talk about this, but there's a kind of, it's like William James said, you have the sort of absolutist on one side smashing the world of experience,

173
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:22,650
and then you have the sort of, you know, the kind of relativist, you know, I just know what I know on the other side, smashing the absolute.

174
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,583
And everyone just kind of smashes and smashes.

175
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:32,766
And it's a bit like a duel at dawn, like a Groundhog Day duel at dawn, where you just have to get up every day and fire at your opponent and then stop again.

176
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:37,100
But there has to be some other debate which accepts the possibility,

177
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:47,100
which I think both of you have offered these ways to do that, where you accept there is an order in language, there are terms we use, there are societal conditions we accept,

178
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,700
where we have to intervene and act, and we can be wrong so that we have to be malleable as well, I think.

179
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:58,266
And in those spaces, do you think that there's what you would be happy to call objectivity?

180
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:15,150
So let me give you, so Jane Bennett has a view of Darcy, and Elizabeth Bennett has a view of Darcy, and you say Jane is wrong, Elizabeth is wrong at the outset?

181
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,250
Well, you'd have to say, so they're having a debate in language with terms in society.

182
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,016
They're talking about the mores, the customs, the manners.

183
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:26,333
They're sort of humans living in this human realm.

184
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:30,600
The question would really be, are they referring their debate to a sort of absolute realm?

185
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:33,866
And I think in this debate, that's my question really to the philosophers.

186
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:35,266
Is that what we're saying?

187
00:16:35,283 --> 00:16:41,483
If we want objective morality, does it have to be redeemed by somewhere whether it goes beyond every human here,

188
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:48,216
it's in a realm of gods or absolute scientific fact that just have nothing of the human,

189
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,983
or can we say there's a sort of societal set of mores that we accept and then we debate,

190
00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:04,250
and they do change and we make wrong decisions, but they are present and they're within our very old languages as well, that we all speak with all these old judgments and values in them.

191
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:05,716
Okay, that's super helpful.

192
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:21,983
I do think, and Simon and Savoy can correct me if I'm wrong, that if you look at the debates in moral philosophy now, most people don't think moral objectivism requires some platonic heaven where moral facts subsist.

193
00:17:22,816 --> 00:17:30,766
They are within the realm of thinking that we have certain practices in terms of which we can make moral claims that are true or false.

194
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,683
So I think that should be the common ground here.

195
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:36,650
Just a small correction. said, correct me if I'm wrong.

196
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,216
Be sure I will correct you even if you are right, okay.

197
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,816
So Simon, is objective morality possible?

198
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:52,883
Yeah, I think you've got to settle for a conception of objectivity along the lines I mentioned.

199
00:17:52,883 --> 00:18:03,000
Objectivity belongs to the process of self-criticism, of assembling evidence, of curiosity, of care, informing your opinions.

200
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:22,683
One of the more frightening things, I think, about the contemporary world is that people will go onto social media, they'll go onto Twitter and so on, and voice opinions, sometimes very nasty opinions, very direct opinions, without taking any care over their verification.

201
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:31,450
So you get conspiracy theories, you get false views and so on, promulgated with the same kind of fervor as any truths that there are.

202
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:39,116
That's not just about morality, that's about just about everything that's the subject of such media storms.

203
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:51,600
The point about a third world or a Popperian world is, I think, well taken and I've no interest in defending it and I don't know anybody really who does.

204
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,933
That is, it doesn't lie beyond us.

205
00:18:56,566 --> 00:19:04,083
the famous philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce, American philosopher at the end of the 19th century,

206
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:11,200
said that it was a mistake to try to define truth, but you could define the search for truth,

207
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:20,600
which was the search for a point beyond which a question is settled, a point beyond which doubt does not arise.

208
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:26,466
Now in the case of ethics, I think there are plenty of points beyond which doubt does not arise.

209
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:36,866
If I ask for a show of hands, how many people in this audience think that it's wrong to stamp on blind babies for fun?

210
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,333
How many people think it's okay to stamp on blind babies for fun?

211
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,366
There's only about three people put their hands up.

212
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:48,016
Yeah.

213
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:53,450
Okay, so there's something which is done and dusted.

214
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:57,050
it, it's beyond discussion.

215
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:59,550
To use the famous phrase of the philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe,

216
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:06,916
if somebody chooses to dissent from it, he shows a corrupt mind, and I have no interest in arguing with him.

217
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:11,150
In other words, it's something which, for the moment, the ground stands firm.

218
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,700
That's where we are.

219
00:20:12,716 --> 00:20:19,650
And then you can go on and see if we can formalize things, make more abstract propositions about morality and so on.

220
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:29,883
And that always proves is very difficult, but the basic judgments from which we start, you've got to start in medias res, in the middle of things.

221
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,183
And those basic judgments from which we start, like the one I mentioned, those stand firm.

222
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,333
Those are done and dusted.

223
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,633
They're part, we can even talk about knowledge if we wish.

224
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,466
And where we talk about knowledge, we can talk about objective knowledge, same thing.

225
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:52,850
So I think the polarized debate, which Joanna talked about,

226
00:20:53,716 --> 00:21:05,966
between relativists on the one hand and the madmen on the other, the fanatics and the totalitarians, that can be put behind us.

227
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:16,833
We've got to look for more nuanced issues within the general sphere of the things we know and the things we are pretty certain of.

228
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:19,600
And then we can perhaps progress.

229
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:25,166
If you start with the abstract ideas of objectivity and subjectivity, you'll get nowhere.

230
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:27,633
OK, brilliant.

231
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:28,350
That's very helpful.

232
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,933
So what I hear Simon saying is that we have some firm ground to stand on.

233
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,733
Don't stomp on blind babies for fun.

234
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:41,450
But what would you say to someone who pressured you and said, well, yeah, OK.

235
00:21:42,316 --> 00:21:43,983
But what about abortion?

236
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,666
What about contraception?

237
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:57,283
What about the fact that we haven't made much moral progress through argumentation of the sort that you champion?

238
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,533
Is that a sign of something?

239
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,650
Yeah, it's a sign that the question is very difficult.

240
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:08,316
And there are things to be said on both sides and plentiful things to be said on both sides.

241
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:13,733
I mean, we all know the basic moves in something like the abortion debate.

242
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,200
People who defend abortion don't defend infanticide,

243
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:26,900
and yet it's a little difficult to be sure where you draw the line, because the processes of life growth are continuous.

244
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,366
So there's a difficult area there.

245
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:37,400
And of course, there's a very difficult area when it comes to the conflict between, let's say,

246
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:49,733
woman's right to take control of her own body, and the alleged right of the fetus to develop into a person, if that's what it can do.

247
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:57,216
So I think there, you know, it's going to be a difficult debate because there are worthwhile things to be said on both sides.

248
00:22:57,216 --> 00:23:02,400
Slavoj, do you want to tell us whether objective morality is possible, not in a third world sense?

249
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,400
I still will like, I don't know what's what's happening with me usually I'm just butchering around,

250
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:16,833
now I'm in a better mood and I try to find common language and I still think there is not a big difference between the two of us.

251
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,850
Yes, I agree with you, ultimately in some sense

252
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:36,683
of course morality expresses our stances but I would say if you permit me using one of old examples of mind that there has to be a minimum of, I'm very anti-Marxist here,

253
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:40,133
Marxists usually attack alienation.

254
00:23:41,766 --> 00:23:50,850
I think there should be a minimum of alienation here that I don't present it just as my expression.

255
00:23:51,216 --> 00:23:54,700
That's why, here comes my old example,

256
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:02,216
phenomena which always interested me are this phenomena the first known example was,

257
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:06,916
and I visited them in south of Greece, so-called weepers.

258
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:13,200
Women whom you pay to cry for you, to do the mourning for you.

259
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,350
People would say how hypocritical and so on.

260
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,500
No, I think this is a positive phenomenon.

261
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,583
It gives you a minimum of distance.

262
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:27,916
You minimally objectivize your stance.

263
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:38,250
The same I would say goes, now you will say, but this goes for primitive cultures like you know, in ancient China, in Tibet, those prayers.

264
00:24:38,366 --> 00:24:39,416
I love this idea.

265
00:24:39,766 --> 00:24:47,983
You put your prayer on a paper, you put the paper in a meal wheel, you turn it around and put it in Stalinist terms,

266
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:53,300
objectively you are praying, even if your mind is on sex or whatever.

267
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:56,900
But now you will say this goes for primitive cultures,

268
00:24:57,233 --> 00:25:02,483
AAA, look at the greatest contribution for me of American culture in the 20th century.

269
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,783
It was so called canned laughter, you remember it.

270
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:10,533
Where laughter is part of the screen.

271
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,183
It worked with me.

272
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:16,983
I often came home in the evening tired as a dog.

273
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:28,233
I put some stupid series on Cheers friends and I didn't laugh just like this but at the end I felt released as if I laughed.

274
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:38,400
And I think I don't want to dismiss this as, I know our Marxist friend will say, extreme commodification, rasication.

275
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:43,350
No, there has to be this minimum of ritualistic alienation.

276
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,516
You do a ritual.

277
00:25:48,866 --> 00:25:52,433
And I think it was shown, I will not take too much time very briefly,

278
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:55,383
Our reaction to pandemic, how?

279
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:12,866
This proper level of minimally objectified mourning didn't function and it was mostly limited precisely on this hysterical outbursts on, of course, on Twitter, on Facebook and so on and so on.

280
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,200
So incidentally, speaking about Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice.

281
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,966
You know, you have a nice ambiguity there.

282
00:26:20,616 --> 00:26:31,350
Usually it's taken, correct me if I'm wrong, that Jane has prejudice against Darcy and Darcy has too much pride.

283
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,033
But you know that I read an excellent reading which turns it around.

284
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,116
But okay.

285
00:26:36,983 --> 00:26:38,066
It's your reading or what?

286
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:38,666
Sorry.

287
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,600
Yeah, it's very nice.

288
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:42,883
Okay, quickly, quickly, quickly.

289
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:53,933
You know when we oppose relativism, moral historicism, relativism and this fundamentalist objective morality,

290
00:26:57,366 --> 00:27:07,100
did you notice that if you take absolutely dogmatically objectivist morality like some religious fundamentalists,

291
00:27:07,716 --> 00:27:21,233
it's the most distracting relativism that you actually introduce into social life because no argumentation counts, is just a pure conflict, quickly, quickly.

292
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:34,833
At some level then, would you agree or not, very limited level, but I think at some level a little bit of moral dogma, dogmaticism, could be helpful, what do you mean by this?

293
00:27:35,216 --> 00:27:36,450
Something very simple.

294
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:42,816
Like there is maybe some progress conditionally in this fact.

295
00:27:43,016 --> 00:27:49,833
I read somewhere a very good feminist point that measured by today's standards, feminist and so on,

296
00:27:52,816 --> 00:28:01,100
80 to 90% of the sex till the 20th century would be considered rape by today's standards.

297
00:28:01,716 --> 00:28:10,833
So isn't there nonetheless progress when certain things are accepted in a good sense dogmatically?

298
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:17,416
Like, I would like to live in a society like this where you don't have to argue.

299
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,266
You shouldn't torture people, women shouldn't be raped.

300
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,516
If you need to argue for it,

301
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:28,450
it's already, you are already losing something.

302
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:35,366
This is why what horrified me is that although, who did this, Dick Cheney or who and then Trump,

303
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:42,750
you remember how some 10, 15 years ago when all of a sudden torture became a topic of debate.

304
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,050
Maybe if we do it in the soft way, water, blah, blah, blah.

305
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:55,200
And even if the majority was opposed to it, this was even more horrible, it became a topic of debate.

306
00:28:55,716 --> 00:28:59,966
Not to mention rape, who was, I always forget his name, she's not my best friend.

307
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:06,266
Some American senator who claimed there is no rape, because for rape there must be penetration,

308
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,866
There is no penetration without the woman getting wet, which means she accept.

309
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,866
The moment we debate for it, we are lost.

310
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,150
The last thing, when we talk about objective research,

311
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:34,566
I still think that here, this is philosophical, problematic, maybe to you and to you.

312
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:56,316
We should, what horrifies me most is examples when factual truth about just what is really out there serves as clearly an instrument of something we don't agree with, like racism and so on.

313
00:29:56,716 --> 00:29:58,133
Like an example.

314
00:29:58,566 --> 00:30:02,033
If I were to be a pro-Neo-Nazi German,

315
00:30:02,516 --> 00:30:11,750
I guarantee you that I could write a book full of facts, only facts, where I say, wait a minute, it's not so simple.

316
00:30:12,016 --> 00:30:20,566
Look at the statistic, 60% of journalists in early 30s were Jews and so on and so on.

317
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:29,800
So the true question here when we fight antisemitism is not the question of objectivity.

318
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:32,483
are facts really like that?

319
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,133
The way anti-Semite describes them.

320
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:42,700
My point is the moment you accept this as a topic of a debate, you sold your soul to the devil.

321
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:50,516
Because the question is not are Jews or Palestinians today, whoever, are really like that?

322
00:30:51,100 --> 00:31:01,916
The true question is why do the Nazis need the image of the Jew, the anti-Semitic image of the Jew to sustain their world view.

323
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,350
So there is some, that is for me the tragedy.

324
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:23,100
The most dangerous propaganda for something which is obviously ethically reprehensible is the propaganda which at the level of facts can be mostly truthful.

325
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:27,950
But that's another topic just if you want me to finish and then you can cut me off more later.

326
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:30,983
The last point, when you, this,

327
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:33,233
when you mentioned Yeats, no?

328
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:35,383
Okay, I have some problems with Yeats.

329
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:38,733
You know that he agreed with 34 racial laws in.

330
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,800
No, no, Yeats has huge problems.

331
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:42,800
Yeah, I'm just using him as an example of this view.

332
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,400
Yeah, so for me, if I take over.

333
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:48,450
But would you condemn an artist for their problems?

334
00:31:48,566 --> 00:31:51,133
That's another moral, because I know I shouldn't ask questions, but.

335
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:53,183
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

336
00:31:53,216 --> 00:31:57,133
I'm a little bit of a, don't tempt me into that direction.

337
00:31:57,233 --> 00:31:58,050
Oh, go on, go on.

338
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:04,883
The only thing I can promise you if Yates goes to Gulag, but he would run a library there and have a relatively.

339
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:19,383
No, no, now more seriously, you know what worries me about passion and so on, is that today we witness, that's so horrible, a lot of false passion.

340
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:20,766
What do I mean?

341
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:29,000
You remember the Glasgow Conference a year ago or when about global warming pollution.

342
00:32:29,633 --> 00:32:39,916
They were saying mostly the right things, but I claim it meant strictly nothing at the level of conclusion.

343
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:48,866
So today, ideology, I still call it ideology, no longer functions in that old way, spreading lies and so on.

344
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:55,683
We have a way to tell the truth which makes the truth inefficient.

345
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:03,916
That's why, for example, I hate this modern, the analysis, you know, Venice Castle,

346
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:12,666
the officially, there is always anti-capitalist, like artists enslaved to market, we are all exploited, Eurocentric.

347
00:33:13,316 --> 00:33:21,083
And, but nonetheless, they fit perfectly today's capitalist functioning of the market.

348
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:37,983
So beware, especially at the level of passing moral judgment, that partial truth, the most dangerous propaganda is the one which uses partial truth to sustain what we all should agree a global life.

349
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:38,866
Sorry if I was too long.

350
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,083
Good, no no, interesting.

351
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:40,750
Yeah.

352
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:46,466
You see people spontaneously expressing their.

353
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,216
Appreciation, so good.

354
00:33:49,116 --> 00:33:56,500
OK, so what we have so far is we have Slavoj saying, look, it's really horrible to even put a topic on the table.

355
00:33:57,366 --> 00:33:59,383
I think we have Simon saying, well, hold on.

356
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:02,000
Let's be open-minded and tolerant.

357
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:03,816
People have different views about things.

358
00:34:04,466 --> 00:34:08,166
Let's let them express their passions and have arguments about them.

359
00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:14,383
Why do we think there is, sorry, for the last time, why do you think there is an opposition here?

360
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:20,916
I thought you said that it's a very bad thing for us to put on the table certain topics.

361
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,066
That's where the objectivity, at least one point where objectivity comes in.

362
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,150
But I said the same thing.

363
00:34:26,466 --> 00:34:36,250
I said if somebody thinks it's OK to stamp on blind babies, especially blind babies, for fun, then I don't want to argue with them.

364
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,566
This is not something that should be in contention, which is basically the same.

365
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:48,466
All right, so the disagreement has to do with what kinds of topics can be properly put on the table.

366
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:50,000
All right.

367
00:34:50,016 --> 00:34:56,883
So moral relativism is a view that allows you to put topics on the table.

368
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:01,700
So Joanna will you tell us what you think about the following novel will be.

369
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,800
I like to stamp on blind babies.

370
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,683
I'll say you told me to write it.

371
00:35:07,683 --> 00:35:08,766
Absolutely.

372
00:35:08,766 --> 00:35:08,983
Do you

373
00:35:11,316 --> 00:35:18,150
Do you think that moral relativism is responsible for the chaos and confusion of current ethics?

374
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,900
Do you want yes or no, or do you want?

375
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:22,383
A bit more.

376
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:33,266
So I think, I mean, when I was talking about the dodgy Yeats, I think it's kind of inevitable that if you have these massive crises in a quite absolute moral order,

377
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,466
then you're gonna have this swing of the pendulum.

378
00:35:37,866 --> 00:35:42,950
And so you have people like the also quite dodgy Yeats, Lawrence, who in 1922, exactly a century ago, says,

379
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:50,450
he says, I really want to thank Mr. Einstein for giving us relativism because we used to be really pinned down.

380
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:51,966
We were all totally pinned.

381
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,483
And now we can kind of buzz around and we all know that we're all different.

382
00:35:57,116 --> 00:36:06,066
The problem with that, and you're right about Yeats, he gets into this kind of, as does Lawrence, this sort of idealized individualism, which is sort of, you know,

383
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,083
the individual has to be the absolute focus.

384
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:13,850
And then you get this atomization and this despair because everybody's kind of,

385
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:21,066
Lawrence has this metaphor of we're all buzzing around, but then everyone's kind of buzzing, you know, miles away potentially from everyone else.

386
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:28,983
So these massive swings, again, we get these huge swings where you end up with these polarities all the time.

387
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:35,983
And I always think of Blake in this, and Blake's quite interesting because he, in the 1790s, he hates the moral order

388
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:45,166
because it's aligned itself with child labor, all these things that we would say are demonstrably bad with the slave trades.

389
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:49,883
Again, I don't think we have to have a discussion about the fact that that's obviously awful.

390
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,200
So he just says, whatever you people think is God, I think is the devil.

391
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:58,400
And whatever you think is the devil, I'm really for the devil.

392
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,766
I'm gonna really go for whatever you think is evil.

393
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:08,150
So he just, as you said about dogmatism, in a way he just inverts the whole thing and says, I've got my own system and it's just not yours.

394
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:10,916
I suspect if he really meant it.

395
00:37:11,233 --> 00:37:16,950
Usually when people say these false radical generalizations they cheat somehow.

396
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:18,950
Oh, do you think when people invert always?

397
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:19,216
Yes.

398
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:20,650
But you can't, I mean, correct.

399
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,066
What if somebody comes and brutally rapes his wife and beats him, he would say, yeah, yeah, good, that's my new job.

400
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,816
No, no, he doesn't mean it, but he doesn't mean like.

401
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,633
What does he mean then?

402
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:34,650
So he doesn't mean the old, well, I mean, I'm now the voice of Blake, but he doesn't mean your old good and evil.

403
00:37:34,716 --> 00:37:37,866
He means actually that good is rebelling against the moral order.

404
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:45,166
He says because the moral order's so mad and appalling, good is rebelling and bad is being meek and just sort of sitting back.

405
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,983
So it's a bit like when you say about the people stamping on babies.

406
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,783
Blake would say it's obviously bad not to say anything and just sort of sit there being meek.

407
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:57,000
But the moral order at the time was praising people for being meek.

408
00:37:57,466 --> 00:38:00,583
So he's trying to say don't be meek if people are doing bad stuff.

409
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:05,150
But I take your point about it's a bit easy to just say, I'll tip it backward.

410
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:11,616
But so, in terms of relativism, I think the question we have now is that it's become a cliche to be a relativist.

411
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,833
Everyone says I'm playing in the ruins and you know, there's no meaning.

412
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:25,166
And then you get people like Surkov for Putin using this relativism saying, you know, there's no lies, so no truth, so politicians can't be judged.

413
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,683
And I think inevitably then there's a huge reaction against that.

414
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,250
And that's incredibly important.

415
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,450
Again though, it's about these pendulum swings.

416
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,933
So I think part of the problem is these massive pendulum swings.

417
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:42,033
And maybe we could go for what Owen Barfield was talking about, which Simon and I have discussed.

418
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:49,400
You had this idea that you clarify positions with these polarities, but you're always trying to find something between or beyond.

419
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:51,900
So that might be my, I think my.

420
00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:53,783
That's really wonderful, thank you.

421
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,750
That kind of feeds into, I think, your views.

422
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,416
So Simon, can you give us a reaction?

423
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:06,566
Yeah, could I raise something that you mentioned in the preamble, Ruth?

424
00:39:06,566 --> 00:39:17,416
You mentioned that absolutism is somehow having a comeback in the mouths of people like Sam Harris and Peter Singer were the two, I think, you mentioned.

425
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,333
And Derek Parfit, the late Derek Parfit.

426
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,450
And Derek Parfit.

427
00:39:21,466 --> 00:39:25,100
Well, Derek is a slightly different kettle of fish, but I think Singer

428
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:42,950
and Sam Harris have very simplistic views about what a full-scale morality should consist in, because both of them are basically utilitarians, which is a classical position.

429
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:43,400
It just says,

430
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:49,116
you know, the one measure of value is the greatest good of the greatest number.

431
00:39:49,116 --> 00:39:52,500
So general happiness, that's all we care about.

432
00:39:52,500 --> 00:40:00,216
And Harris makes that even worse by thinking that science tells us that.

433
00:40:00,216 --> 00:40:01,683
Science tells us no such thing.

434
00:40:01,683 --> 00:40:05,750
Science doesn't determine your attitude to anything.

435
00:40:05,766 --> 00:40:16,500
It may require an attitude of wonder to the world and openness to evidence and experience, but it doesn't tell you that that the source of all value is human happiness, or anything like it.

436
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:26,800
His idea that science provides the authority behind which we can all shelter is, I think, a dangerous fantasy.

437
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:30,716
And that derives from my other reason.

438
00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:33,483
It's a question of what attitudes you have to things.

439
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,666
Science tells you what you should think about some things

440
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:39,433
and does it very well, does it with great authority.

441
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,700
but it doesn't tell you what attitude you should have to the things you find.

442
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:50,983
Scientists might be as happy to be studying a rattlesnake as to be studying a bunny rabbit,

443
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:57,500
but it doesn't mean that you should have the same attitudes to the rattlesnake as you do to the bunny rabbit.

444
00:40:58,316 --> 00:41:04,966
In fact, if you've got children, I should hope that they don't have the same attitudes to rattlesnakes and bunny rabbits.

445
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,650
So I think he's just hiding to nothing.

446
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:24,633
Singer isn't quite as naive as that, but again he seems to be blind to the enormous amount of criticism that utilitarianism as a monolithic doctrine has encountered over the years.

447
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:33,966
One of the obvious ones is that utilitarians have to struggle to make sense of things like gratitude and justice.

448
00:41:33,966 --> 00:41:34,366
These things

449
00:41:34,716 --> 00:41:46,316
fit if at all with great difficulty into the utilitarian calculus because often there might be cases of injustice which actually work to the general good.

450
00:41:46,316 --> 00:42:03,316
The classic case is something like if you can procure the execution of somebody who's innocent of a crime thereby avoiding social unrest riots, pogroms, and so on, then you should do it.

451
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:12,533
And a lot of people find that rebarbative and think, no you shouldn't, you should never procure the judicial execution of somebody who's innocent of a crime.

452
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:25,166
So there are all these cases which are textbook cases of difficulties for utilitarianism, and I think to sail on as if they didn't exist is not really being objective about things.

453
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:27,683
OK.

454
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:31,166
I couldn't agree more as another professional philosopher.

455
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:43,733
I think people here should know that although this debate has been framed as if moral relativism is no longer fashionable, moral relativism in many circles was never fashionable.

456
00:42:44,816 --> 00:42:48,283
There have been very strong arguments against it given by professional philosophers.

457
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,783
So we mentioned Derek Parfit, Derek Parfit's view.

458
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:55,616
If you buy his view, here's a way you can be a moral objectivist without being nutty.

459
00:42:56,316 --> 00:43:02,883
Nuddy, yeah, hold on you can think that you know, there are these the two plus two equals four

460
00:43:03,266 --> 00:43:05,033
That's an absolute truth.

461
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:12,150
It's a necessary truth in mathematics and Stomping on blind babies for fun is wrong.

462
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:18,150
That's also a necessary moral truth We take foundational truths and then we mix in all of our contingent

463
00:43:18,416 --> 00:43:25,866
Circumstances languages the way we think our culture and so on and we work our way way towards the best moral truths we can.

464
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,233
And that's a way to be a moral objectivist.

465
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:32,400
OK, we're not going to move on to the third question.

466
00:43:34,316 --> 00:43:36,666
And this is our final theme for the day.

467
00:43:36,966 --> 00:43:40,500
Will the trend towards objective morality continue?

468
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,716
And if so, what impact would it have?

469
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,233
Slavoj, you go first.

470
00:43:45,366 --> 00:43:48,400
I will really try to be, which is very difficult for me.

471
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:56,150
You know, here I am a pessimist, not a relativist pessimist, but a pessimist.

472
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:01,683
The example to which we are obviously all returning, stamping on a blind child.

473
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:07,266
I can imagine, not just imagine, from what I know there was a civilization

474
00:44:07,666 --> 00:44:15,650
when this was not literally this, but something like this was experienced as part of your social duty.

475
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:22,700
ancient Sparta where a child was, if it was crippled, it had to be disposed of.

476
00:44:22,716 --> 00:44:26,500
So a quick correction, it's simply for fun.

477
00:44:26,866 --> 00:44:28,250
You do it just for fun.

478
00:44:29,516 --> 00:44:35,116
Not because you're fulfilling a social obligation or playing a role, it just gives you your jollies.

479
00:44:35,516 --> 00:44:36,516
I put that in carefully.

480
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,033
Yeah.

481
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,666
Yeah, that it gives you, sorry.

482
00:44:41,433 --> 00:44:41,833
Just for fun.

483
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:53,150
Here it's again ambiguous because one of the perverted obsessions is that you do something for fun but mask it as your duty.

484
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:55,900
That's what usually sadistic teachers do.

485
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:02,850
They beat you and then they tell you if you are a poor pupil, oh it's horrible for me to do it, it's just unfortunate.

486
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:03,983
But let me go on.

487
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:05,700
Moral relativism.

488
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,866
It is, the problem we are getting today, I hope we will all agree is that, how should I call it?

489
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:21,033
Local moral absolutism is getting combined with global relativism.

490
00:45:21,566 --> 00:45:27,916
One of the things which made me infinitely sad is, you remember when Taliban won over in Afghanistan?

491
00:45:28,566 --> 00:45:32,650
They immediately made a pact with China.

492
00:45:33,416 --> 00:45:35,083
The deal was very brutal, man.

493
00:45:35,216 --> 00:45:38,150
They called it respect for each other's culture.

494
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:48,916
But the deal was, we do here what we want, Muslim fundamentalism, but you do what you want with Uyghurs, with Muslims there.

495
00:45:49,750 --> 00:46:00,216
So nonetheless, I'm here more open to what you were saying, and I would say like this, it's very human, it's naive, nobody would expect this

496
00:46:00,616 --> 00:46:08,300
maybe from me, but I will just tell you a fact which I learned and then tested it, not with both, with one of the guys.

497
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:15,683
You remember General Jaruzelski, his coup d'etat in 1980, blah, blah.

498
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:29,583
Then they had at the end negotiations and one of the top negotiations on the other side was Adam Michnik, now a big journalist there and so on.

499
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:37,550
And do you know, first I thought it's a crazy rumor, then I met at a round table, Adam Michnik, I asked him, he confirmed.

500
00:46:38,066 --> 00:46:42,116
Already at that round table, they simply,

501
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:44,333
how do you put it in this New Age term?

502
00:46:44,466 --> 00:46:46,116
There was a vibe between them.

503
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:55,750
They became close friends, met regularly in spite of differences and I find this so civilized.

504
00:46:56,016 --> 00:46:59,066
Now Kaczynski brothers are mad they are ruining it.

505
00:46:59,466 --> 00:47:10,016
But this basic civilization, the big, Do you know when Jaruzelski was then dying in the hospital, Valensa visited him there.

506
00:47:10,466 --> 00:47:20,583
Isn't it nice to have a certain level of civility which even when you have the fiercest debates, it goes on.

507
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:29,050
So the thing with Putin when it was mentioned is that be careful of Putin.

508
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:38,150
He may appear to be, and that's the most dangerous thing about Russia today, they may appear to be pluralist.

509
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,883
American imperialism, liberalism will not control us.

510
00:47:42,433 --> 00:47:52,283
But if you look at it closely, they propose a new, very religiously fundamentalist, openly fascist.

511
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:59,300
I'm not using the term fascism with regard to Putin due to some leftist interpretations.

512
00:47:59,633 --> 00:48:08,533
His state philosopher is Ivan Ilyin from the 1920s who openly proposed the idea of Russian fascism and so on.

513
00:48:09,033 --> 00:48:13,216
Let me stop with this and just one question, maybe more for him than for you.

514
00:48:14,033 --> 00:48:15,800
What about this argument?

515
00:48:16,716 --> 00:48:19,300
I don't quite buy it, but it's intriguing.

516
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:31,783
You must know it from people like Jurgen Habermas and some others, not my favorite philosopher, but who claim that we cannot simply distinguish

517
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:44,716
scientific exploration of facts and normative activity because science itself is in some sense a normative activity.

518
00:48:45,066 --> 00:48:52,583
You follow a certain goal with a certain methodology, with all freedom of argumentation.

519
00:48:53,033 --> 00:49:04,666
In this sense, they would say science cannot be simply opposed to, I wouldn't say morality, but normative activity, it has a normativity of its own.

520
00:49:05,633 --> 00:49:12,850
That's also their argument against scientific naturalism, that there is always a normative dimension in it.

521
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:15,100
Go ahead, Simon.

522
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,766
I think the premise is true.

523
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:20,216
There is always a normative dimension in any inquiry.

524
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:27,916
If you're inquiring and you're being careful, then there'll be a way to do it and a way not to do it.

525
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,383
There'll be norms governing whether the inquiry is being well pursued.

526
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:34,750
So in that sense, I think they're absolutely right.

527
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:40,150
But of course, those norms may have nothing to do with morality in a wider sense.

528
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:48,616
You can have an immoral scientist who pursues his experiments with exemplary care and exemplary objectivity.

529
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,700
I think Newton was an extremely unpleasant man.

530
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,666
I'm allowed to say that.

531
00:49:55,766 --> 00:49:59,733
He was a member of my college, but he was.

532
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:06,066
And yet, of course, he was one of the greatest, probably the greatest scientists that Britain's ever had.

533
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:12,833
So, you know, it's not moral norms that dictates how you pursue your science.

534
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,466
It's basically what you're trying to find out.

535
00:50:15,766 --> 00:50:16,633
That pursues.

536
00:50:17,233 --> 00:50:20,400
That's what dictates how you pursue the finding out of it.

537
00:50:22,233 --> 00:50:31,983
So I'm pretty sure, yes, that Slavoj thinks that there's more than just norms inside of an activity.

538
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,033
Like how do you put the beaker like this?

539
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:39,016
And that he thinks that everything is political all the way down, but we're not gonna go there.

540
00:50:39,066 --> 00:50:39,850
We're not gonna go there.

541
00:50:40,366 --> 00:50:42,616
We're going to give Joanna the last word.

542
00:50:42,716 --> 00:50:43,400
Any comments?

543
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:45,400
Like it's just really briefly on science.

544
00:50:45,516 --> 00:50:48,216
And I, yeah, I think it's really interesting about the norms, absolutely.

545
00:50:48,233 --> 00:50:52,983
And this question, there's an interesting book writer as well, Martin Gurri.

546
00:50:53,466 --> 00:50:57,200
So the book actually isn't where he makes this point but his book's called The Revolt of the Public.

547
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:08,583
But he also makes a point about the pandemic really and it's this question, maybe just leave it as a question that say in the 14th century, the prevailing order is the religious order and when the plague comes,

548
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:14,083
people have this terrible crisis because they think God is angry and this is vengeance.

549
00:51:14,616 --> 00:51:19,750
And so they have this metaphysical crisis because they think, why has this order condemned us so much?

550
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:27,250
And now we have, we're not governed by the clergy, but we have governments taking their cues and advice from scientists.

551
00:51:27,433 --> 00:51:30,866
And that's obviously really brilliant, works really well in many, many cases.

552
00:51:31,233 --> 00:51:39,100
But there is a question then, if that fails, does it precipitate a kind of metaphysical crisis in that order?

553
00:51:39,633 --> 00:51:40,916
And I guess that's just a question.

554
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:44,533
It's not my question, it's the sort of guru question which I leave you with.

555
00:51:45,016 --> 00:51:46,200
Thank you all for coming.

556
00:51:46,416 --> 00:51:49,550
Please thank our speakers for a very interesting discussion.

557
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:02,550
非常感谢你们 

558
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:07,900
感谢大家的到来 希望这里不会太热 

559
00:00:09,316 --> 00:00:12,250
今天我们将讨论道德事实与道德幻想 

560
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,633
在后现代时代 它曾是流行的（话题） 

561
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:26,916
道德相对主义一直有其批评者 不仅是主流分析哲学家 尤其是那些带有宗教倾向的人 

562
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:36,450
但现在出现了新一代的名人思想家 这次是带有无神论倾向的 从萨姆·哈里斯到已故的德里克·帕菲特到彼得·辛格 

563
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,916
他们声称存在一套绝对的道德真理

564
00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:47,033
即使他们会嘲笑像维多利亚人那样严格的道德准则 

565
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:52,266
批评者认为 像过去的威权道德主义者一样 

566
00:00:53,566 --> 00:01:00,366
他们使用所谓的客观道德来支持自己的偏见并压制异议 

567
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:09,700
我们应该欢迎客观道德的回归 作为当前伦理混乱和困惑的解药吗 

568
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,966
或者它是一种威权幻想 需要在获得进一步的支持之前予以消除 

569
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:28,600
或者我们应该放弃道德主张 转而静心评估我们的社会利益以及任何特定行动的威胁 

570
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,433
我很高兴介绍我们的发言人 

571
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,183
首先我们有斯拉沃热·齐泽克 

572
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,133
他可以说是我们这个时代最知名的名人哲学家 

573
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:44,233
《外交政策》将他命名为全球百大思想者 

574
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:45,566
只有100位 

575
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:46,950
只有前100位 

576
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,366
非常低的评价

577
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:56,200
为一个荒谬的空中时代而发声

578
00:01:56,216 --> 00:02:09,516
我右边的西蒙·布莱克本 是一位学术哲学家 以其在元伦理学方面的工作而闻名 他出版了十几本关于各种哲学问题的书籍 面向公众和学术听众 

579
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:20,200
我远左边的乔安娜·卡瓦纳 是许多小说和非小说作品的作者 包括《冰博物馆》、《现实指南》和《ZED》 

580
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:28,450
她因其写作赢得了许多奖项 包括橙色新作家奖和《格兰塔》英国最佳作家奖 

581
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:37,983
好的 言归正传 我现在想向我们的各位小组成员提出一个问题 他们每人有三分钟时间 

582
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,700
三分钟 斯拉沃热 三分钟 

583
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,600
抱歉 我听得不太清楚 

584
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,016
我听到30分钟 但好吧 

585
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,233
来给我们对这个问题的反应 

586
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:48,900
这是问题 

587
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:57,783
我们应该欢迎道德客体的回归 还是它只是一种威权幻想 

588
00:02:58,133 --> 00:02:59,383
我将从斯拉沃热开始 

589
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:04,716
非常简短 我希望稍后有机会继续 

590
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,483
首先 这完全取决于你如何定义客观道德和道德相对主义 

591
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:17,050
我认为这里有第三个术语 

592
00:03:17,616 --> 00:03:22,566
如果我可以简要提到一个我不太同意的哲学家 卡尔·波普 

593
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:25,900
你知道 他引入了第三世界的概念

594
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:44,500
像象征秩序的客观事实 在某种意义上不属于外部现实 但称它们为主观的、感性的 也是错误的 

595
00:03:45,116 --> 00:03:54,183
在这个意义上 我认为道德若想要作为道德而运行 必须在最低限度上是客观的 

596
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:08,033
你不能有一种道德 声称它直接就表达了你的态度 你的什么 但只是给出两三个方向的暗示 我想要走向哪里 

597
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,950
现在已发生了巨大的历史变革 

598
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:19,000
但我认为 尽管有许多规则在某种程度上是不同时代共有的 

599
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:29,816
我始终被每一个客观系统所吸引 不仅仅是道德 还包括习俗等 

600
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:38,216
总是依赖于隐含的非书面的规则 这些是绝对关键的 

601
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:48,000
我将以仅两个我最喜欢的例子作结 一个是 你有没有注意到很多事情被禁止 

602
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:56,150
但是系统本身 在字里行间 它促使你去违反禁令 

603
00:04:56,533 --> 00:05:01,900
比如我有一个非常粗俗的经历 抱歉说得这么低俗 关于我年轻时与父亲的经历 

604
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:07,016
他警告我不要过早与女性接触等等

605
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:10,500
然后他询问 但你已经做了吗 

606
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:12,483
你表现得怎么样

607
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:29,550
因此 在这种模糊性和更有趣的结论之后 那就是我们甚至被要求去做某事的相反版本 在你不去做这件事的条件下 你可以去做它

608
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,483
例如 我的最爱 好吧 

609
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,000
我举一个普通和一个极端的例子 然后我就不说了 

610
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:39,900
普通的例子 你有没有 我不是在说英格兰的那些“叛徒” 

611
00:05:40,316 --> 00:05:48,166
这里在威尔士 你们也有这种习惯吗 我请你吃晚餐 很明显我会付钱 

612
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:53,083
但是当账单来的时候 如果我请你 

613
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,700
你必须坚持一段时间 不不 让我们分担一下 等等 

614
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,516
我们俩都知道最后我会付钱 

615
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:08,166
但那个人必须提出一个我们知道会被拒绝的提议 

616
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,266
我最喜欢的例子 这确实发生了 

617
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,533
抱歉 老式的斯大林主义苏联 

618
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:22,833
在苏联 不仅仅是批评斯大林被禁止 

619
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:29,850
公开宣布这种禁令甚至更加被禁止 

620
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,516
有一次会议上 一个人举手说 斯大林同志这里错了 

621
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,350
然后另一个人举手说 你疯了吗 

622
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,983
我们这里不这么说话 

623
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,366
你不能批评斯大林 

624
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,866
第二个人消失得比第一个人快多了 

625
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:50,100
你知道 这是非常优雅的事情 

626
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:53,583
禁令本身被禁止了 

627
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,983
所有这些只是为了让事情复杂化 谢谢 

628
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,800
精彩 这确实让事情变得复杂 

629
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:13,900
我现在要把话题转给西蒙 因为你说 哦 我们不应该把道德 道德主张 道德真理看作是我们持有的态度的表达 

630
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,516
西蒙 你怎么看 

631
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:18,400
嗯 那正是我对他们的看法 

632
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,983
对不起 什么 

633
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,983
这是一个表达还是说你同意我 

634
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,200
我认为说“道德是态度的表达”没什么不对 

635
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:37,233
它通常不仅仅是你的个人态度 至少是你试图让其他人同意的态度 

636
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:44,433
所以 如果我说鲍里斯·约翰逊是坏事 我认为如果我是真诚的 我会这么做 

637
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:54,000
那将是我对他行为方式的态度表达 但在表达它时 我不仅仅是情绪化或者发泄 

638
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:57,200
普遍的原因中 一部分是试图征求同意 

639
00:07:57,233 --> 00:08:12,566
如果你不同意我 我希望你能说出原因 然后我会说为什么我认为他是坏事 我们来来回回讨论 这种艺术 这一点取决于要达成某种社会共识 

640
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,100
现在我们可能知道我们无法获得社会共识 

641
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:21,466
我知道保守党里有的人

642
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,000
保守党后座议员不会同意我说鲍里斯·约翰逊是坏事

643
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:29,900
至少在他失去首相职位之前不会 

644
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,483
（换首相之后）他们可能会开始同意 

645
00:08:33,766 --> 00:08:38,500
但重点是表达一种态度并为这种态度征求同意 

646
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:42,116
现在 人们说 啊 但那里有什么客观性呢 

647
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:46,300
嗯 客观性是一个非常有趣的词 

648
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:49,166
人们认为道德要么是客观的 要么是主观的 

649
00:08:50,216 --> 00:08:51,200
我不这么认为 

650
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:55,866
我认为通过客观地追求 一个观点才变得客观 

651
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:07,900
这意味着看证据 对可能有影响的事情保持好奇 甚至如卡尔·波普尔曾强调 

652
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:16,866
乐于找到反驳它的证据 乐于找到那些不完全支持它的东西 这迫使你重新思考 

653
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:32,016
换句话说 就好像我们内置了一个批评家 它本身对我们自己的观点感到担忧 并且有改进这些观点的愿望 而我们并尽可能地支持它们 这就算作客观性 

654
00:09:32,816 --> 00:09:34,016
你们都知道这是可以的 

655
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:35,816
如果你们中的某个人被传唤了 

656
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:40,233
假设你因为一项你没犯的罪行被逮捕 

657
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,916
你会祈祷警方对此的调查是客观的 

658
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:56,933
所以重点是寻找证据、好奇心、愿意保持开放心态 这是客观性的标志 

659
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,600
从这个意义上说 有些观点比其他观点更具客观性 

660
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,766
认为鲍里斯·约翰逊是坏事的观点完全是客观的 

661
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:12,166
除了我已经提到的人 没有任何可想见的异议 

662
00:10:12,516 --> 00:10:13,666
我已经说了三分钟了吗 

663
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:14,716
好的 

664
00:10:14,716 --> 00:10:14,833
很好 

665
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:15,933
太棒了 

666
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,283
好的 

667
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,000
现在让我们的小说家发表意见 

668
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:20,700
乔安娜 

669
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:21,483
谢谢 

670
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,666
我想起了一个老笑话 

671
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,750
当然存在客观的道德标准 只要是我说的就行 

672
00:10:26,816 --> 00:10:32,633
我的意思是 这种内在的前提下 这里有一种不可思议的合理共识 

673
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,083
这太棒了 

674
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,500
你提到的另一个词 威权幻想 

675
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:42,233
所以我想如果我们考虑一下 为什么在辩论中会提到威权幻想 

676
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:44,816
以及这种想法 “坚定不移”

677
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:49,783
当我想到道德时 我经常想起威廉·巴特勒·叶芝在1919年写的那首诗

678
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:58,350
《第二次来临》 它是在第一次世界大战的彻底屠杀和大屠杀之后写的 这是一次绝对的末日 

679
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:04,233
他谈到了万物分崩离析 中心无法维系 纯粹的无政府状态在世界上肆虐 

680
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:06,750
但他还写了这些奇怪的诗行 

681
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:18,483
如果你读它们 我记得为GCSE读它时 我是这种充满激情的青少年 他们说 最好的人毫无信念 最坏的人充满了强烈的激情 

682
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,033
你会想 当然 充满强烈的激情是非常好的 

683
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:26,550
那么 感受强烈的激情难道不是一件好事吗 

684
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:27,866
为什么那会是最坏的 

685
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,050
为什么最好的人会缺乏信念 

686
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:38,116
我认为叶芝的意思是 真正的狂热者掌权 并说 我们已经搞定了绝对的道德秩序 

687
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:45,833
没有人可以反对 每个人都必须按照我们的说法行事 因为我们与某种更高的事业或力量保持联系 

688
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,533
他们以一种矛盾的方式将一切推向这种无政府状态 

689
00:11:51,316 --> 00:12:02,083
所以正如我的同事们所说 有另一种非常古老的传统 关于我们如何过上好生活 怎样生活得美好 

690
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:09,516
这种讨论追溯到最早的哲学文学文本之一 我们所知道的最早的之一 《吉尔伽美什史诗》 大概在公元前2000年 

691
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:11,750
所以这是一场永无止境的辩论 

692
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:22,400
另一方面 你有这种狂热的热情 这种强烈的激情转变为强烈的病态狂热 这影响了讨论 

693
00:12:23,016 --> 00:12:31,533
当然 小说家只是在中间某处游走 试图写出表达一切、表达各种观点的小说 

694
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:34,450
我认为艾丽丝·默多克对此有一个很好的看法 

695
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:41,700
她谈到你需要表达一个道德立场 否则你就会陷入叶芝所说的境地 

696
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:43,016
你会失去所有的信念 

697
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:44,533
你会失去勇气 

698
00:12:44,616 --> 00:12:45,650
你什么都做不了 

699
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,666
你无法对抗这些充满狂热的人 

700
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:55,733
所以她主张你应该尝试一种开放性 她的观点是一种多孔的道德立场 

701
00:12:56,433 --> 00:13:03,966
阿德里安·里奇也有相同的看法 不要让他人代替你去讨论和命名一切 这是一个道德责任

702
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,416
你要试着自己去表达和命名 但你也尝试让其他人这样做 

703
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:20,900
所以我认为 更少的世界末日 更少的疯狂者 相当多的小说 如果可以的话 是的 一种多孔的道德视角 

704
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:21,666
谢谢 

705
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:23,333
这是三分钟还是更多 

706
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:23,866
远远超过了 

707
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,166
是的 没问题 没问题 

708
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:25,933
是的 抱歉 可能更多 

709
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:34,250
我不想在这里扮演时间上的纳粹 但好吧 让我们更深入一点 看看是否能进一步明确所说的内容 

710
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:37,150
让我为你们提出另一个问题 

711
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,100
客观的道德真的可能吗 

712
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,283
我想从乔安娜开始 

713
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:53,833
好吧 所以我认为西蒙在定义 他在说 这个我们可能定义为波普尔的想法 斯拉沃热也提到了 这种象征秩序 

714
00:13:54,316 --> 00:14:02,950
因为 否则 你就会陷入这种坚硬如石的词典定义 这将是某种超越感觉和判断的存在 

715
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:09,783
实际上 在道德问题中 我们的感受、经历和判断是非常基础的 

716
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:16,466
所以我认为这个问题 你如何将你的道德秩序从所有感觉判断中剥离 

717
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:19,716
我的意思是 当你遇见某人时 你会感觉 我信任他们吗 

718
00:14:20,716 --> 00:14:22,133
这是我想要交谈的事情吗 

719
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:25,033
你可能会错 

720
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:35,450
所以如果你考虑像《傲慢与偏见》这样的道德文本 1813年 奥斯汀的作品 全部关于你如何遇见某人而你的判断是错误的 

721
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:43,450
你知道 莉兹·班纳特一开始对达西的判断是错误的 因为他很粗鲁 不愿与她跳舞 并且搅乱了她妹妹的爱情生活 

722
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,600
所以最初她认为他是坏人 但后来她获得了更多信息 

723
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:54,416
她做出了不同的判断 但仍然保持了对人的本质构成的某种感觉 

724
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:58,866
斯拉沃谈到的我们对他人的期望值 

725
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,733
所以我认为如果你的意思是 这场辩论的事情是 

726
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:14,483
我的哲学同事真应该谈谈这个 但有一种 就像威廉·詹姆斯说的 一方是绝对主义者 他们在粉碎经验世界

727
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:22,650
另一方 是相对主义者 我只知道我所知道的 粉碎绝对 

728
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,583
每个人都在不断地粉碎 

729
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:32,766
这有点像黎明时分的决斗 像《地狱咆哮的日子》里黎明时分的决斗 你每天都必须起床并向你的对手开火 然后再次停下 

730
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:37,100
但必须有另一种讨论 接受可能性 

731
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:47,100
我认为你们两位都提供了这样做的方法 其中你接受语言中有一个秩序 我们使用的术语 我们接受的社会条件 

732
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,700
在那里我们必须干预和行动 我们可以犯错 所以我们也必须具备可塑性 

733
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:58,266
在这些空间中 你认为存在你乐于称之为客观性的东西吗 

734
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:15,150
让我给你举个例子 珍·班纳特对达西有一个看法 伊丽莎白·班纳特对达西也有一个看法 你说珍错了 伊丽莎白一开始就错了 

735
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,250
嗯 你必须说 他们在用社会中的术语进行语言辩论 

736
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,016
他们在讨论风俗、习惯、礼仪 

737
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:26,333
他们是生活在这个人类领域的人类 

738
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:30,600
真正的问题将是 他们的辩论是否参照了某种绝对领域 

739
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:33,866
我认为在这场辩论中 这真的是我的问题 是给哲学家的 

740
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:35,266
我们是这么说的吗 

741
00:16:35,283 --> 00:16:41,483
如果我们想要客观道德 那是否代表着它将从我们身上被拿走 放在一个超越众人的地方

742
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:48,216
它在众神或绝对科学事实的领域中 那里完全没有与人类相关的事物 

743
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,983
或者我们可以说 有一套社会风俗我们接受 然后我们辩论 

744
00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:04,250
它们确实会改变 我们会做出错误的决定 但它们存在 也存在于我们非常古老的语言中 我们都用这些充满古老判断和价值观的语言交流 

745
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:05,716
好的 这非常有帮助 

746
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:21,983
我确实认为 如果我没理解错 西蒙和斯拉沃可以纠正我 如果你看现在的道德哲学辩论 大多数人不认为道德客观主义需要某种柏拉图式的天堂 道德事实在其中存在 

747
00:17:22,816 --> 00:17:30,766
他们认为我们有某些实践 根据这些实践我们可以提出真或假的道德主张 

748
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,683
所以我认为这应该是这里的共同基础 

749
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:36,650
只是一个小小的更正 说如果我错了请纠正我 

750
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,216
即使你是对的 确保我也会纠正你 好吗 

751
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,816
所以西蒙 客观道德可能吗 

752
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:52,883
是的 我认为你必须接受我提到的那种客观性的概念 

753
00:17:52,883 --> 00:18:03,000
客观性属于自我批评的过程 属于证据的收集 好奇心 关怀 在形成你的观点的这个过程中 

754
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:22,683
我认为关于当代世界的一个更令人担忧的事情是 人们会上社交媒体 上推特等 发表观点 有时是非常恶劣的观点 非常直接的观点 而没有去验证过它 

755
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:31,450
所以你得到阴谋论 得到错误的观点等等 它们以和任何真理一样的热情被传播 

756
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:39,116
这不仅仅关于道德 这关于几乎是这类媒体风暴下的所有主题 

757
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:51,600
我认为 关于第三世界或波普尔世界的观点已经得到很好的理解 我没有兴趣捍卫它 而且我不知道有谁会真的这样做

758
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,933
也就是说 它并不在我们之外 

759
00:18:56,566 --> 00:19:04,083
著名哲学家查尔斯·桑德斯·皮尔斯 19世纪末的美国哲学家 

760
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:11,200
说试图定义真理是一个错误 但你可以定义对真理的追求 

761
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:20,600
这是寻找一个问题得到解决的点 一个超过这个点之后就不会产生疑问的点 

762
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:26,466
现在在伦理学的情况下 我认为有很多点不再产生疑问 

763
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:36,866
如果我请求大家举手 有多少人认为出于乐趣践踏盲婴是错误的 

764
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,333
有多少人认为出于乐趣践踏盲婴是可以的 

765
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,366
大约只有三个人举手 

766
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:48,016
是的 

767
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:53,450
好的 所以有些事情已经定论 

768
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:57,050
它 它是不容讨论的 

769
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:59,550
使用哲学家伊丽莎白·安斯科姆的著名短语 

770
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:06,916
如果有人选择对此表示异议 他显示出了一个腐败的心智 我对与他争论没有兴趣 

771
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:11,150
换句话说 这是某种在当下 立场坚定的事情 

772
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,700
我们就是在这里 

773
00:20:12,716 --> 00:20:19,650
然后你可以继续看看我们是否可以使事物形式化 关于道德做出更抽象的命题等等 

774
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:29,883
这总是非常困难的 但我们开始的基本判断 你必须从事物的中间开始 

775
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,183
我们开始的那些基本判断 就像我提到的那个 那些是坚定的 

776
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,333
那些已经定论 

777
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,633
在我们愿意的情况下 它们是我们可谈论的知识的一部分

778
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,466
在我们谈论知识时 我们可以谈论客观知识 同样的事情 

779
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:52,850
所以我认为乔安娜谈到的两极化辩论 

780
00:20:53,716 --> 00:21:05,966
一方是相对主义者 另一方是疯子 狂热者和极权主义者 这可以抛在我们身后 

781
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:16,833
我们必须寻找更微妙的问题 这些问题位于我们已知的事物和我们相当确定的事情的一般领域内 

782
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:19,600
然后我们或许可以取得进步 

783
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:25,166
如果你从客观性和主观性的抽象观念开始 你将无处可去 

784
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:27,633
好极了 

785
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:28,350
那非常有帮助 

786
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,933
所以我听到西蒙说我们有坚实的立足点 

787
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,733
不要因为乐趣而踩踏盲婴 

788
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:41,450
但如果有人向你施压并说 好吧 是的 好的 

789
00:21:42,316 --> 00:21:43,983
但堕胎呢 

790
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,666
避孕呢 

791
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:57,283
事实上 我们并没有通过你所支持的那种讨论取得多少道德进步 这又如何呢 

792
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,533
这是某种迹象吗 

793
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,650
是的 这表明这个问题非常困难 

794
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:08,316
双方都有很多值得说的事情 

795
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:13,733
我的意思是 我们都知道像堕胎辩论这样的基本论点 

796
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,200
支持堕胎的人不支持杀婴 

797
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:26,900
然而 确定划界线的确有些困难 因为生命成长的过程是连续的 

798
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,366
所以那里有一个困难的领域 

799
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:37,400
当然 在冲突之间也有一个非常困难的领域 比如说 

800
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:49,733
女性控制自己身体的权利 以及胎儿发展成为一个人的所谓权利 如果它能够做到的话 

801
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:57,216
所以我认为 你知道 这将是一个困难的辩论 因为双方都有值得讨论的事情 

802
00:22:57,216 --> 00:23:02,400
斯拉沃 你能告诉我们客观道德是否可能吗 不是在第三世界的意义上 

803
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,400
我仍然会喜欢 我不知道我怎么了 通常我只是到处乱来 

804
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:16,833
现在我心情更好 我试图找到共同语言 我仍然认为我们两个之间没有太大的区别 

805
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,850
是的 我在某种意义上同意你 

806
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:36,683
当然道德表达了我们的立场 但我想说 如果你允许我使用我以前的一个例子 这里必须有最低限度的 我在这里非常反马克思主义 

807
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:40,133
马克思主义者通常攻击异化 

808
00:23:41,766 --> 00:23:50,850
我认为这里应该有最低限度的异化 即我不仅仅将其呈现为我的表达 

809
00:23:51,216 --> 00:23:54,700
这就是为什么 这里有我以前的一个例子 

810
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:02,216
一直让我感兴趣的现象是这些现象 第一个已知的例子是 

811
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:06,916
我在希腊南部访问过的所谓的哭丧女 

812
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:13,200
你付钱给女人 让她们为你哭泣 为你哀悼 

813
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,350
人们会说多么虚伪等等 

814
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,500
不 我认为这是一个积极的现象 

815
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,583
它给你一定的距离 

816
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:27,916
你在最小程度上客观化了你的立场 

817
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:38,250
同样的 我会说这适用于 现在你会说 但这适用于原始文化 就像你知道的 在古代东印度 在西藏 那些祈祷 

818
00:24:38,366 --> 00:24:39,416
我喜欢这个想法 

819
00:24:39,766 --> 00:24:47,983
你把你的祷告写在纸上 把纸放在祈祷轮上 转动它 用斯大林主义的话来说 

820
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:53,300
客观上你在祈祷 即使你的心思在性或其他事情上 

821
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:56,900
但现在你会说这适用于原始文化 

822
00:24:57,233 --> 00:25:02,483
看看对我来说20世纪美国文化的最大贡献 

823
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,783
那就是所谓的笑声带 你还记得 

824
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:10,533
笑声是屏幕的一部分 

825
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,183
它对我有效 

826
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:16,983
我经常晚上累得跟狗一样回家 

827
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:28,233
我放上一些愚蠢的连续剧 比如《欢乐时光》《老友记》 我并没有真的笑 但最后我感觉像笑过一样感到释放 

828
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:38,400
我认为我不想将这简单地视为 我知道我们的马克思主义朋友会说 这是极端的商品化、实物化 

829
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:43,350
不 必须有这种最低限度的仪式性异化 

830
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,516
你进行一个仪式 

831
00:25:48,866 --> 00:25:52,433
我认为已经展示了 我不会占用太多时间 非常简短地 

832
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:55,383
我们对大流行的反应 如何 

833
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:12,866
这种适当层面的最小程度客观化的哀悼没有起作用 而且主要局限于这种歇斯底里的爆发 当然 是在Twitter、Facebook等等上 

834
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,200
顺便说一下 《傲慢与偏见》中的简·奥斯汀 

835
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,966
你知道 那里有一个很好的模糊性 

836
00:26:20,616 --> 00:26:31,350
通常被理解为 纠正我如果我错了 简对达西有偏见 而达西过于骄傲 

837
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,033
但你知道 我读到了一个很好的解读 将其颠倒了 

838
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,116
但好吧 

839
00:26:36,983 --> 00:26:38,066
这是你的解读还是什么 

840
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:38,666
抱歉 

841
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,600
是的 非常好 

842
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:42,883
好的 快点 快点 快点 

843
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:53,933
你知道当我们反对相对主义、道德历史主义、相对主义和这种根本主义的客观道德时 

844
00:26:57,366 --> 00:27:07,100
你注意到了吗 如果你绝对地、教条地接受客观主义道德 比如一些宗教根本主义者 

845
00:27:07,716 --> 00:27:21,233
实际上你引入了最具破坏性的相对主义进入社会生活 因为任何论证都不重要 这只是纯粹的冲突 

846
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:34,833
那么在某种程度上 你同意或不同意 （它只局限于）非常有限的程度 但我认为在某种程度上 一点点道德教条主义 可能会有帮助 这是什么意思 

847
00:27:35,216 --> 00:27:36,450
一些非常简单的事情 

848
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:42,816
比如 可能在这个事实上有一些有条件的进步 

849
00:27:43,016 --> 00:27:49,833
我在某处读到一个非常好的女性主义观点 以今天的标准 女权主义等 

850
00:27:52,816 --> 00:28:01,100
直到20世纪 80%到90%的性行为按照今天的标准被视为强奸 

851
00:28:01,716 --> 00:28:10,833
那么 当某些事情在良好意义上被教条式地接受时 难道不是还是有进步吗 

852
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:17,416
像 我想生活在这样一个社会 你不必争论 

853
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,266
不应该折磨人 女性不应该被强奸 

854
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,516
如果你需要为此争论 

855
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:28,450
那就已经 你已经失去了一些东西 

856
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:35,366
这就是为什么让我感到恐怖的是 虽然 是谁做的 迪克·切尼还是谁然后是特朗普 

857
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:42,750
你记得大约10、15年前当折磨突然成为辩论话题时吗 

858
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,050
也许如果我们用柔和的方式做 用水 等等 

859
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:55,200
即使大多数人反对它 这更加可怕 它变成了一个辩论话题 

860
00:28:55,716 --> 00:28:59,966
更不用说强奸了 是谁 我总是忘记他的名字 她不是我最好的朋友 

861
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:06,266
一些美国参议员声称没有强奸 因为强奸必须有插入 

862
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,866
而如果女性没有变湿 那就无法插入 （能够插入）这意味着她同意了 

863
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,866
我们一旦为此辩论 我们就输了 

864
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,150
最后一点 当我们谈论客观研究时 

865
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:34,566
我仍然认为这里 这是哲学上的问题 也许对你和你来说 

866
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:56,316
我们最恐惧的是 当关于外面真实存在的事实的真相 明显地作为我们不同意的东西的工具时 比如种族主义等 

867
00:29:56,716 --> 00:29:58,133
比如一个例子 

868
00:29:58,566 --> 00:30:02,033
如果我是一个亲纳粹的德国人 

869
00:30:02,516 --> 00:30:11,750
我保证我能写一本充满事实的书 只有事实 我说 等一下 事情没那么简单 

870
00:30:12,016 --> 00:30:20,566
看看统计 30年代初60%的记者是犹太人等等 

871
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:29,800
所以这里当我们反对反犹太主义时 问题不是客观性 

872
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:32,483
事实真的是那样吗 

873
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,133
反犹太主义者描述它们的方式 

874
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:42,700
我的观点是 你一旦接受这作为辩论的话题 你就把灵魂卖给了魔鬼 

875
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:50,516
因为问题不是犹太人或今天的巴勒斯坦人 无论是谁 他们真的是那样的吗 

876
00:30:51,100 --> 00:31:01,916
真正的问题是 为什么纳粹需要犹太人的形象 反犹太主义的形象来维持他们的世界观 

877
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,350
所以这是某种 对我来说是悲剧 

878
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:23,100
最危险的宣传对于一些明显在伦理上应受谴责的事情是 在事实层面上大部分是真实的宣传 

879
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:27,950
但那是另一个话题 只是如果你想让我结束 然后你可以稍后再打断我 

880
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:30,983
最后一点 当你 这个 

881
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:33,233
当你提到叶芝 对吗 

882
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:35,383
好的 我对叶芝有一些问题 

883
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:38,733
你知道他同意了1934年的种族法律 

884
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,800
不 不 叶芝有很大的问题 

885
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:42,800
是的 我只是把他作为这种观点的一个例子 

886
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,400
是的 因为如果我是他的话 当时我也会这么做 

887
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:48,450
但你会因为艺术家的问题而谴责他们吗 

888
00:31:48,566 --> 00:31:51,133
那是另一个道德问题 因为我知道我不应该问问题 但是 

889
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:53,183
是的 是的 是的 是的 是的 是的 是的 是的 

890
00:31:53,216 --> 00:31:57,133
我有点 不要引诱我走那个方向 

891
00:31:57,233 --> 00:31:58,050
哦 继续 继续 

892
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:04,883
如果叶芝去了古拉格 我唯一能向你保证的是 他会在那里经营一个图书馆 一个相对的图书馆 

893
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:19,383
不 不 现在更认真地说 你知道我对激情的担忧是什么 就是今天我们见证了 这太可怕了 很多虚假的激情 

894
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:20,766
我的意思是

895
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:29,000
你还记得一年前或者什么时候的格拉斯哥会议关于全球变暖污染吗 

896
00:32:29,633 --> 00:32:39,916
他们说的大部分都是正确的 但我认为这在结论层面上毫无意义 

897
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:48,866
所以今天 意识形态 我仍然称之为意识形态 不再以那种旧的方式发挥作用 传播谎言等等 

898
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:55,683
我们有一种说真话的方式 使真相变得无效 

899
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:03,916
这就是为什么 例如 我讨厌这种现代的 分析 你知道 威尼斯城堡 

900
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:12,666
官方总是反资本主义 就像艺术家被市场奴役 我们都被剥削 欧洲中心主义 

901
00:33:13,316 --> 00:33:21,083
但尽管如此 他们完美地适应了今天资本主义市场的运作方式 

902
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:37,983
所以要小心 特别是在做出道德判断时 部分真相 最危险的宣传是使用部分真相来支持我们都应该同意的全球谎言 

903
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:38,866
抱歉我说得太长了 

904
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,083
好的 没有 很有趣 

905
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:40,750
是的 

906
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:48,216
你看到人们自发地表达他们的欣赏 所以很好 

907
00:33:49,116 --> 00:33:56,500
好的 所以到目前为止 我们有斯拉沃说 把某个话题放到桌面上真的很可怕 

908
00:33:57,366 --> 00:33:59,383
我认为我们有西蒙说 等一下 

909
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:02,000
让我们保持开放和宽容 

910
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:03,816
人们对事物有不同的看法 

911
00:34:04,466 --> 00:34:08,166
让他们表达他们的激情并就此进行辩论 

912
00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:14,383
为什么我们认为这里存在 抱歉 最后一次 为什么你认为这里存在对立 

913
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:20,916
我以为你说把某些话题放到桌面上是非常糟糕的事情 

914
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,066
这就是客观性的所在 至少在这一点上是客观性能发挥作用的 

915
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,150
但我说了同样的事情 

916
00:34:26,466 --> 00:34:36,250
我说如果有人认为处于乐趣而踩踏盲婴——尤其是盲婴——是可以的 那我就不想和他们争论了 

917
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,566
这不是应该争论的事情 基本上是一样的 

918
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:48,466
好的 所以分歧在于可以适当地将哪些话题放到桌面上 

919
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:50,000
好的 

920
00:34:50,016 --> 00:34:56,883
所以道德相对主义是一种允许你将话题放到桌面上的观点 

921
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:01,700
那么乔安娜 你会告诉我们你对下一部小说的看法吗 

922
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,800
我喜欢踩踏盲婴 

923
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,683
我会说是你叫我写的 

924
00:35:07,683 --> 00:35:08,766
绝对 

925
00:35:08,766 --> 00:35:08,983
你

926
00:35:11,316 --> 00:35:18,150
你认为道德相对主义是否对当前伦理的混乱和困惑负有责任 

927
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,900
你想要是或否 还是想要 

928
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:22,383
多一点 

929
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:33,266
所以我认为 我的意思是 当我谈论狡猾的叶芝时 我认为如果你在一个相当绝对的道德秩序中遇到这些巨大的危机 

930
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,466
那么你会有这种钟摆式的摆动 这是不可避免的 

931
00:35:37,866 --> 00:35:42,950
所以你有像叶芝这样的人 劳伦斯 他在1922年 正好一个世纪前 说 

932
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:50,450
他说 我真的很想感谢爱因斯坦给了我们相对主义 因为我们过去真的被完全限制住了 

933
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:51,966
我们都被完全固定住了 

934
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,483
而现在我们可以各自发言 我们都知道我们都是不同的 

935
00:35:57,116 --> 00:36:06,066
问题在于 你对叶芝的看法是对的 他像劳伦斯一样陷入了这种理想化的个人主义 这有点像 

936
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,083
个体必须成为绝对的焦点 

937
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:13,850
然后你得到这种原子化和绝望 因为每个人都在...

938
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:21,066
劳伦斯有这样的比喻 我们都在嗡嗡飞来飞去 但是每个人都可能离别人数英里远 

939
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:28,983
所以这些巨大的摆动 我们又一次得到这些极端 你总是以这些两极对立结束 

940
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:35,983
我总是在这里想到布莱克 布莱克相当有趣 因为他在1790年代 他讨厌道德秩序 

941
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:45,166
因为它与童工——所有我们会说是明显不好的东西——如奴隶贸易等 站在一起 

942
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:49,883
再次 我不认为我们必须讨论这显然是可怕的事实 

943
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,200
所以他只是说 无论什么 你们将其视为上帝 我会将其视为魔鬼 

944
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:58,400
无论什么 你们将其视为魔鬼 我都会支持这个魔鬼 

945
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,766
我要真正追求那些你们认为是邪恶的东西 

946
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:08,150
所以他就像你说的关于教条主义 某种程度上他只是颠倒了整个事物并说 我有自己的系统 只是不是你们的 

947
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:10,916
我怀疑他是否真的是认真的 

948
00:37:11,233 --> 00:37:16,950
通常当人们做出这些虚假的激进概括时 他们某种程度上在欺骗 

949
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:18,950
哦 你认为人们总是颠倒吗 

950
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:19,216
是的 

951
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:20,650
但你不能 我的意思是 正确

952
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,066
如果有另一个人来并且残忍地强奸他的妻子并殴打他 他会说 是的 是的 好的 那是我的新工作 

953
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,816
不 不 他不是这个意思 

954
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,633
那他是什么意思呢 

955
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:34,650
所以他不是指旧的好与恶 我现在持布莱克的观点 但他不是指你们的旧的好与恶 

956
00:37:34,716 --> 00:37:37,866
他实际上是说好就是反抗道德秩序 

957
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:45,166
他说因为道德秩序如此疯狂和可怕 好就是反叛 坏就是温顺地坐在那里 

958
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,983
所以这有点像当你谈到踩踏婴儿的人 

959
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,783
布莱克会说 不说任何话并只是坐在那里温顺地就显然是不好的 

960
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:57,000
但当时的道德秩序却赞扬人们温顺 

961
00:37:57,466 --> 00:38:00,583
所以他试图说 如果人们做了坏事 不要温顺 

962
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:05,150
但我接受你的观点 只是简单地说 我会将其倒置 

963
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:11,616
但是 就相对主义而言 我认为我们现在面临的问题是 成为相对主义者已成为一种陈词滥调 

964
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,833
每个人都说 我游乐于废墟之中 没有意义 

965
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:25,166
然后你得到像苏尔科夫这样为普京服务的人 利用这种相对主义说 你知道 没有谎言 所以没有真相 所以政治家不能被评判 

966
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,683
我认为这种情况下不可避免地会有巨大的反应 

967
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,250
这是极其重要的 

968
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,450
不过 这关于钟摆的摆动 

969
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,933
所以我认为问题的一部分是这些巨大的钟摆摆动 

970
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:42,033
也许我们可以考虑欧文·巴菲尔德所谈论的 西蒙和我已经讨论过的 

971
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:49,400
你有这样的想法 通过这些对立面来阐明立场 但你总是试图找到介于两者之间或超越两者的东西 

972
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:51,900
所以那可能是我的 我认为我的 

973
00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:53,783
那真的很棒 谢谢你 

974
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,750
这有点符合 我认为 你的观点 

975
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,416
所以西蒙 你能给我们一个反应吗 

976
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:06,566
是的 我能提一个你在前言中提到的东西吗 鲁斯 

977
00:39:06,566 --> 00:39:17,416
你提到绝对主义以某种方式在像萨姆·哈里斯和彼得·辛格这样的人口中复兴 我认为你提到的是这两个人 

978
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,333
还有已故的德里克·帕尔菲特 

979
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,450
还有德里克·帕尔菲特 

980
00:39:21,466 --> 00:39:25,100
嗯 德里克是个有点不同的问题 但我认为辛格

981
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:42,950
和萨姆·哈里斯对于全面道德应该包含什么有非常简单化的观点 因为他们两个基本上都是功利主义者 这是一个古典立场 

982
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:43,400
它只是说 

983
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:49,116
你知道 价值的唯一衡量标准是最大多数的最大幸福 

984
00:39:49,116 --> 00:39:52,500
所以总体幸福 这就是我们关心的一切 

985
00:39:52,500 --> 00:40:00,216
哈里斯认为科学告诉了我们这一点 而这让情况变得更糟 

986
00:40:00,216 --> 00:40:01,683
（因为）科学没有告诉我们这样的事情 

987
00:40:01,683 --> 00:40:05,750
科学不决定你对任何事物的态度 

988
00:40:05,766 --> 00:40:16,500
它可能需要对世界保持惊奇的态度 对证据和经验保持开放 但它不告诉你所有价值的来源是人类幸福 或类似的任何东西 

989
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:26,800
他认为科学提供了我们所有人都可以依靠的权威 我认为这是一个危险的幻想 

990
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:30,716
这源于我的另一个理由 

991
00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:33,483
这是一个关于你对事物持有什么态度的问题 

992
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,666
科学告诉你应该如何看待某些事物

993
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:39,433
并且做得非常好 具有很大的权威性 

994
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,700
但它并没有告诉你应该对你发现的事物持有什么态度 

995
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:50,983
科学家可能会对研究响尾蛇和对研究兔子感到同样的快乐 

996
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:57,500
但这并不意味着你应该对响尾蛇和兔子持有相同的态度 

997
00:40:58,316 --> 00:41:04,966
实际上 如果你有孩子 我希望他们对响尾蛇和兔子的态度不同 

998
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,650
所以我认为他（Sam Harris）只是一厢情愿 

999
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:24,633
辛格（Peter Singer）并不像那样天真 但他似乎对功利主义作为一种单一学说多年来遭受的大量批评视而不见 

1000
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:33,966
一个显而易见的问题是 功利主义者必须努力解释像感激和正义这样的事物 

1001
00:41:33,966 --> 00:41:46,300
这些事物在功利主义的计算中很难适应 因为通常可能有一些不公正的案例实际上有助于总体的好处 

1002
00:41:46,316 --> 00:42:03,316
典型的案例是 如果你能通过处决一个无罪的人从而避免社会动荡、暴动、屠杀等 那么你就应该这么做 

1003
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:12,533
很多人发现这种做法令人反感 并认为不应该这样做 你永远不应该为了司法上的执行而处决一个无罪的人 

1004
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:25,166
所以这些都是功利主义面临的经典困难案例 而忽视这些案例的存在并不是真正客观地对待事物 

1005
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:27,683
好的 

1006
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:31,166
我非常同意 作为另一位专业哲学家 

1007
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:43,733
我认为这里的人们应该知道 尽管这场辩论被描述为道德相对主义不再流行 但在许多圈子里 道德相对主义从未流行过 

1008
00:42:44,816 --> 00:42:48,283
专业哲学家给出了反对它的非常有力的论证 

1009
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,783
所以我们提到了德里克·帕菲特 德里克·帕菲特的观点 

1010
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:55,616
如果你接受他的观点 这里有一种方式可以让你成为一名道德客观主义者而不是疯狂的 

1011
00:42:56,316 --> 00:43:02,883
你可以认为 二加二等于四

1012
00:43:03,266 --> 00:43:05,033
那是一个绝对真理 

1013
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:12,150
它是数学中的一个必然真理 而出于乐趣踩踏盲婴是错误的 

1014
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:18,150
那也是一个必然的道德真理 我们取基础真理 

1015
00:43:18,416 --> 00:43:25,866
然后混合我们的所有的偶然环境、语言、我们的思考方式、我们的文化等等 我们尽我们所能地朝着最好的道德真理努力 

1016
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,233
这是成为一名道德客观主义者的方式 

1017
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:32,400
好的 我们不会转向第三个问题 

1018
00:43:34,316 --> 00:43:36,666
这是我们今天的最后一个主题 

1019
00:43:36,966 --> 00:43:40,500
向客观道德的趋势会继续吗 

1020
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,716
如果是 它会产生什么影响 

1021
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,233
斯拉沃伊 你先来 

1022
00:43:45,366 --> 00:43:48,400
我真的会努力做到 这对我来说非常困难 

1023
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:56,150
你知道 我在这里是一个悲观主义者 不是相对主义的悲观主义者 而是一个悲观主义者 

1024
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:01,683
我们显然都会回到这个例子 踩踏一个盲眼孩子 

1025
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:07,266
我可以想象 不仅仅是想象 根据我所知道的 有一个文明 

1026
00:44:07,666 --> 00:44:15,650
当时这不是字面上的这个 但类似这样的事情被体验为你的社会职责的一部分 

1027
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:22,700
古代斯巴达 如果孩子残疾 就必须被处理掉 

1028
00:44:22,716 --> 00:44:26,500
所以快速地更正一下 它仅仅是为了乐趣 

1029
00:44:26,866 --> 00:44:28,250
你只是为了乐趣而做 

1030
00:44:29,516 --> 00:44:35,116
不是因为你在履行社会义务或扮演角色 它只是给你带来快乐 

1031
00:44:35,516 --> 00:44:36,516
我谨慎地说这件事 

1032
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,033
是的 

1033
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:41,833
是的 它给你带来 对不起 仅仅是为了乐趣 

1034
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:53,150
这里它又是模棱两可的 因为一种变态的痴迷是 你为了好玩而做某事 但却把它伪装成你的责任 

1035
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:55,900
这是通常施虐的教师会做的事情 

1036
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:02,850
他们打你 然后告诉你——如果你是一个成绩差的学生——哦对我来说做这件事很可怕 这只是不幸的 

1037
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:03,983
但让我继续 

1038
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:05,700
道德相对主义 

1039
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,866
我们今天遇到的问题 我希望我们都能同意 我该怎么称呼它 

1040
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:21,033
局部道德绝对主义正在与全球相对主义结合起来 

1041
00:45:21,566 --> 00:45:27,916
让我无限悲伤的一件事是 你记得塔利班在阿富汗取得胜利吗 

1042
00:45:28,566 --> 00:45:32,650
他们立即与东印度达成了协议 

1043
00:45:33,416 --> 00:45:35,083
交易非常残酷 伙计 

1044
00:45:35,216 --> 00:45:38,150
他们称之为彼此尊重对方的文化 

1045
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:48,916
但交易是 我们在这里做我们想做的 穆斯林原教旨主义 但你们可以对待维吾尔人 随意对待你们那里的穆斯林 

1046
00:45:49,750 --> 00:46:00,216
所以尽管如此 我在这里对你所说的更加开放 我会这样说 这很人性化 很天真 没有人会期望我会这样做 

1047
00:46:00,616 --> 00:46:08,300
但我只会告诉你一个我学到然后测试过的事实 不是两个人 而是其中一个人 

1048
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:15,683
你还记得雅鲁泽尔斯基将军 1980年的政变

1049
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:29,583
然后他们最后进行了谈判 另一方的高层之一是亚当·米奇尼克 现在那里是一位大记者等等 

1050
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:37,550
你知道 起初我以为这是一个疯狂的谣言 然后我在一个圆桌会议上遇到了亚当·米奇尼克 我问了他 他证实了 

1051
00:46:38,066 --> 00:46:42,116
在那个圆桌会议上 他们简单地...

1052
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:44,333
你怎么用这个新时代术语表达呢 

1053
00:46:44,466 --> 00:46:46,116
他们之间有一种氛围 

1054
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:55,750
他们成为了亲密的朋友 尽管有分歧 但仍然定期见面 我觉得这非常文明 

1055
00:46:56,016 --> 00:46:59,066
现在卡钦斯基兄弟疯了 他们在毁掉这一切 

1056
00:46:59,466 --> 00:47:10,016
但这种基本的文明 大的 你知道当雅鲁泽尔斯基后来在医院垂死时 瓦文萨去看望了他 

1057
00:47:10,466 --> 00:47:20,583
即使当你有最激烈的辩论时 还能保持一定水平的文明 这难道不是很好吗 

1058
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:29,050
所以关于普京的事情 当它被提及时 要小心普京 

1059
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:38,150
他可能表面上看起来 这是今天俄罗斯最危险的事情 他们可能表面上看起来是多元化的 

1060
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,883
美国帝国主义 自由主义不会控制我们 

1061
00:47:42,433 --> 00:47:52,283
但如果你仔细观察 他们提出了一种新的 非常宗教原教旨主义 公开的法西斯主义 

1062
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:59,300
我使用法西斯主义一词来形容普京 并不是因为一些左翼的解释 

1063
00:47:59,633 --> 00:48:08,533
他的国家哲学家是20世纪20年代的伊万·伊林 他公开提出了俄罗斯法西斯主义的想法等等 

1064
00:48:09,033 --> 00:48:13,216
让我就此打住 只问一个问题 也许更多是问他而不是你 

1065
00:48:14,033 --> 00:48:15,800
这个论点怎么样 

1066
00:48:16,716 --> 00:48:19,300
我不太买账 但这很有趣 

1067
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:31,783
你一定知道尤尔根·哈贝马斯和其他一些人的观点 虽然他不是我最喜欢的哲学家 但他们声称

1068
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:44,716
我们不能简单地区分对科学事实的探索和规范性活动 因为科学本身在某种意义上是一种规范性活动 

1069
00:48:45,066 --> 00:48:52,583
你遵循着某个目标 采用着某种方法 拥有所有论证的自由 

1070
00:48:53,033 --> 00:49:04,666
在这个意义上 他们会说科学不能简单地与道德或规范性活动对立 它自有其规范性 

1071
00:49:05,633 --> 00:49:12,850
这也是他们反对科学自然主义的论点 即其中总是有一个规范性维度 

1072
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:15,100
继续 西蒙 

1073
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,766
我认为前提是正确的 

1074
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:20,216
任何探究中总是存在规范性维度 

1075
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:27,916
如果你在进行探究并且很小心 那么就会有正确的做法和不正确的做法 

1076
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,383
将会有规范来规范调查是否得到妥善进行 

1077
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:34,750
所以在这个意义上 我认为他们绝对正确 

1078
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:40,150
但当然 那些规范可能与更广泛意义上的道德无关 

1079
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:48,616
你可以有一个不道德的科学家 但他以规范的小心和规范的客观性进行他的实验 

1080
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,700
我认为牛顿是一个非常不讨人喜欢的人 

1081
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,666
我可以这么说 

1082
00:49:55,766 --> 00:49:59,733
他是我的学院成员 但他确实是...

1083
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:06,066
而且 当然 他是英国有史以来最伟大的科学家之一 可能是最伟大的 

1084
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:12,833
所以 你知道 不是道德规范决定了你如何进行科学研究 

1085
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,466
而是基于你试图找到什么 

1086
00:50:15,766 --> 00:50:16,633
那个追求 

1087
00:50:17,233 --> 00:50:20,400
那决定了你如何去发现它 

1088
00:50:22,233 --> 00:50:31,983
所以我很确定 是的 斯拉沃伊认为在一项活动中不仅仅有规范 

1089
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,033
比如你怎么放试管这样 

1090
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:39,016
而且他认为一切都是政治的 一直到底 但我们不会去那里 

1091
00:50:39,066 --> 00:50:39,850
我们不会去那里 

1092
00:50:40,366 --> 00:50:42,616
我们将给乔安娜最后一个发言机会 

1093
00:50:42,716 --> 00:50:43,400
有什么评论吗 

1094
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:45,400
关于科学 我想说的很简短 

1095
00:50:45,516 --> 00:50:48,216
是的 我认为关于规范的讨论非常有趣

1096
00:50:48,233 --> 00:50:52,983
而且这个问题 有一位有趣的书作者 马丁·古里 

1097
00:50:53,466 --> 00:50:57,200
所以这本书实际上不是他提出这一点的地方 但他的书名为《公众的反抗》 

1098
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:08,583
但他也提出了一个关于疫情的问题 也许只是把它作为一个问题 在14世纪 占主导地位的秩序是宗教秩序 当瘟疫来临时 

1099
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:14,083
人们经历了一场可怕的危机 因为他们认为上帝生气了 这是复仇 

1100
00:51:14,616 --> 00:51:19,750
所以他们经历了一场形而上学的危机 因为他们认为 为什么这个秩序如此强烈地谴责我们 

1101
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:27,250
而现在我们不是由神职人员统治 但我们有政府从科学家那里获得提示和建议 

1102
00:51:27,433 --> 00:51:30,866
这显然非常出色 在很多情况下工作得很好 

1103
00:51:31,233 --> 00:51:39,100
但如果那失败了 是否会引发那个秩序中的一种形而上学危机 

1104
00:51:39,633 --> 00:51:40,916
我想这只是一个问题 

1105
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:44,533
这不是我的问题 这是古里提出的问题 我留给你们 

1106
00:51:45,016 --> 00:51:46,200
感谢大家的到来 

1107
00:51:46,416 --> 00:51:49,550
请感谢我们的发言人进行了一次非常有趣的讨论
