1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,266
you must measure the degree to which everyone's needs are being met.

2
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:15,733
But to do that, you have to get clear what are the needs that need to be met for us to have a peaceful, harmonious, healthy community.

3
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:22,100
So, he and his colleagues did a lot of work in trying to ask themselves, what are our needs?

4
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:34,400
And they came up, Manfred is his first name, M-A-N-F-R-E-D, and his last name is Max Neef,

5
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:38,600
that's hyphenated, M-A-X hyphen N-E-E-F.

6
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:51,566
And after research, they came up with nine needs that they decided to measure to see whether an economy was successful or not.

7
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:55,700
He could measure the degree to which these needs were being met.

8
00:00:57,566 --> 00:01:02,800
And the first, he calls sustenance, the first need, sustenance.

9
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:15,133
And I actually, in my way of thinking about needs, I would say that involves about four or five different needs, but he lumps them all in one.

10
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:23,333
And I would call them the way, instead of sustenance in my language, I would say the basic physical needs.

11
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:29,866
Air, water, food, shelter, clothing.

12
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:36,400
The basic physical needs.

13
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:47,533
His second need, safety, protection.

14
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:53,066
Third need, love.

15
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,200
Fourth need, understanding.

16
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,166
I would prefer the word empathy, but his word is understanding.

17
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Next, creativity.

18
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:16,400
Next, recreation.

19
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,766
He includes in this play, rest.

20
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,700
So, recreation, play, rest.

21
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,700
Next, he calls community.

22
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:39,033
I prefer the German word geborganheit.

23
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:42,100
Warm nest would be another way I would say it in English.

24
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,800
Warm community.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,566
Warmness.

26
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,600
Geborgen.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,333
Doesn't that feel...

28
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,266
Well, you could see it that way, but he means different.

29
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,666
He has a different way of measuring it.

30
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:09,866
And then come two of the needs that I think are probably, if we really measure to be fully human, to feel really human being,

31
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,466
these two needs are very important, and this would be autonomy.

32
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:26,833
and look in the newspaper on any given day and see how many wars are going on almost daily around the world over this subject.

33
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,566
Human beings do not want someone to come along and say,

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,733
I have a right to control you.

35
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:36,766
And yet, most teachers think it's their job to control students.

36
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,966
Most managers think it's their job to control employees.

37
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:46,400
So that's why you have wars in the schools between the teachers and the students.

38
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:53,333
It worked between the managers and the employees, at home between parents and children.

39
00:03:54,533 --> 00:04:05,333
You want to hear an autonomy war, go down some neighborhood in the evening that has a lot of children in it, and listen in on houses, and you'll hear autonomy wars going on.

40
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:09,666
You'll hear a parent giving an order to a three-year-old.

41
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:11,133
Time to go to bed.

42
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:13,300
Three-year-old, no!

43
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,466
Autonomy war, you see.

44
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:22,100
think it's their job to make the children behave.

45
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,566
Teachers think it's their job to make children behave.

46
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:29,033
Managers think it's their job to make people behave.

47
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,800
My children taught me how foolish that was.

48
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:38,066
The first thing they taught me, I couldn't make them do anything.

49
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:42,766
All I could do is make them wish they had.

50
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:53,333
Then they told me anytime I would do that, they would make me wish I hadn't and made them wish they had.

51
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,100
So once I got that, we didn't have the autonomy wars.

52
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:03,300
And then that need that Victor Frankl calls the most important human need from a standpoint

53
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:09,200
of really being evolved as a human being, the need for meaning, the need for purpose.

54
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:20,833
But of course, if you're educated in the way that most people are educated in, you get that need for meaning all mixed up with money.

55
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:28,333
You get the need for meaning all mixed up with money, or status.

56
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:32,666
You think that your job title gets that need for meaning.

57
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,833
That ninth one gets mixed up.

58
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,666
Oh yeah, that's the one our culture really wants to screw you up with.

59
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,133
They want you to think your need for meaning gets met by the bigger car you drive.

60
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:53,666
So they get the strategy all mixed up with the more money you earn.

61
00:05:54,100 --> 00:06:00,666
If you want to read a book that I find very powerful on how our culture systematically

62
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:10,533
screws up our minds to mix up this important need for meaning with what the consumer culture wants us to want, read Michael Lerner's book.

63
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,766
His name is L-E-R-N-E-R.

64
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:33,466
Michael Lerner, the book is called Spirit Matters, in English, and it's all about how our culture systematically mis-educates us to mix up needs and strategies

65
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,500
Spirit matters.

66
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:56,266
That's why such an important part of non-violent communication is to help people not get needs mixed up with strategies for meeting the needs because, you see, it's pretty hard to keep this separate.

67
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:06,000
For example, if you live in the United States and you have ever watched television for more than 10 minutes, you'll think you have a need for a McDonald hamburger.

68
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:13,133
You can't imagine a person surviving on our planet without a McDonald hamburger daily.

69
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:25,200
And how can you think that, from the time you're a child, you see this cleverly presented advertisements two or three times in a 15-minute program.

70
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,233
And it's presented in a way to get the child to nag the parents to take them to McDonald's.

71
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:54,066
So if you get that, so our brains get warped very quickly by the corporate world that want us to get our needs all mixed up with our strategies for getting the needs mixed up, getting the needs met.

72
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:05,633
So to develop your vocabulary, what I did, which helps me a lot, I went through that list of nine.

73
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:19,566
My words for capturing those nine are not the same that Manfred Max Neef uses, so I translated them into my language that I would just use with myself for those nine things.

74
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,733
That resonates for me with those nine needs.

75
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:29,733
And then I said, now, how can I express those needs when I'm talking to a three-year-old?

76
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:38,033
So I figured out how I might, because, see, all human beings have the same needs.

77
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,533
That's important to be conscious of, so every human being.

78
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:48,500
So the three-year-old has a need for autonomy, but I doubt that many three-year-olds would use that word.

79
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,366
So how do I get this need across to a three-year-old that I'm talking with?

80
00:08:56,733 --> 00:09:00,733
When I work with street gangs, how would I express these nine needs?

81
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,666
When I work with college professors, if ever we need to be literate at how to express something,

82
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:20,933
it would be how to express those nine needs, and how to hear them behind whatever language the other person uses,

83
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:30,866
because the more important a need is to many people, the best they know how to express the need is this way.

84
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:37,600
The problem with you is, so a lot of needs are expressed that way, especially the needs

85
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:45,533
that the person is the most desperate about, so I also then did an exercise, I took the

86
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:55,666
most aggravating messages coming my way from other people, and then practiced guessing of what need might be behind that.

87
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,433
What is that person's need?

88
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:06,100
So I worked very hard to be able to see anything that used to sound like a criticism.

89
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:11,366
It's really a poor expression of an unmet need.

90
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:18,533
So anytime something sounds like criticism, I know it's a chance to practice translating judgements into needs.

91
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:27,533
Anytime I want to make a criticism, time to translate the criticism into my unmet need.

92
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:34,533
Any other comments or questions you have about that?

93
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:35,700
Yeah.

94
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:43,900
I have a question because I wonder if a three-year-old has the same,

95
00:10:48,366 --> 00:11:03,333
I wonder if the need for love is, no, a three-year-old has a need for being confirmed, or seen, or...

96
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:20,700
And the way a three-year-old asks to be seen is maybe an indirect way as saying, saying, I don't want to go to bed?

97
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,133
Well, if the child says, I don't want to go to bed, if they said it with that tone, I would guess the need is autonomy.

98
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:39,966
Because, you see, if the parent has single-mindedness of purpose to get them to bed, of course, then you cannot use nonviolent communication.

99
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:46,400
You can never use nonviolent communication if you have single-mindedness of purpose.

100
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:54,833
See, we can only use non-violent communication when our objective is to create a connection

101
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,633
that allows everybody's needs to get met through compassionate giving and receiving.

102
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:13,900
If it's my objective to get what I need, I was sitting in an airport in Dallas, Texas to a woman who had a three-year-old sitting next to her.

103
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:20,866
And this child, I was just sitting there for about 20 minutes, didn't move, about three years old.

104
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:27,533
Finally, an elderly woman sitting near the woman said, I've never seen such a well-mannered child just sitting there.

105
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,200
And the mother said, yes, I've learned the secret to parenting.

106
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:34,566
Make sure you have a cracker.

107
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:38,700
She had a box of crackers and a smacker.

108
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:39,900
She had a ping pong paddle.

109
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:46,733
So when the child sat as she wanted, she'd give him a cracker, but if he got up, smack him.

110
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:53,300
So that's how most teachers and parents are educated, you know, a cracker and a smacker.

111
00:12:53,466 --> 00:13:00,500
So if your objective is to get somebody to do what you want, don't study nonviolent communication,

112
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:09,033
go to a dog obedience school, a dog obedience school, and see how they train dogs, reward

113
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,166
So how would you make sure that the three-year-old get enough sleep?

114
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:33,033
You know, this was a question that I saw for myself doing a workshop in the United States with physicians who were in charge of health care at universities.

115
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:35,700
And I was doing a workshop with them.

116
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:51,966
And at that time, every evening, we had the bedtime war at the Rosenberg household, trying to get a three-, four-, and seven-year-old into bed on time for their health.

117
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:57,966
And what really helped me, having lunch with one of the physicians, the physician said to me,

118
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:03,133
Do you know what one of our biggest health problems is at the University, Marshall?

119
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:03,966
I said, no, what?

120
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:12,800
It's 18-year-olds coming away to the University after having 18 years with parents who tell them what time to go to bed at night.

121
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:17,966
They literally don't listen to their bodies and they don't know what time to go to sleep

122
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:25,933
and they stay up all night and about the second month of the semester we just have a whole bunch of sick people.

123
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,433
I said, you just helped me solve the bedtime problem at the Rosenberg house.

124
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,066
He said, what do you mean?

125
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:38,900
I said, I thought I was getting them to bed every night for their health.

126
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,733
And now you just helped me realize I never told my dog what time to go to sleep.

127
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,900
The dog didn't get sick.

128
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:52,166
So are my children less intelligent than the dog?

129
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,333
So I went home and had the following dialogue with him.

130
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,866
Really, it's a true story.

131
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:09,766
I said to him, look, I think that I haven't been clear about why I want you to go to bed at night.

132
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:10,966
Does anybody know?

133
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,333
I told him over and over, but it hadn't sunk in.

134
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:19,833
And I said again, I care about your health, you know, and that's why I want you to get sleep.

135
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:20,000
Is

136
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:27,500
And my son, my older son, said, but Dad, sometimes we're not tired then.

137
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,700
Well, that made sense to me.

138
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,866
I'd hate to have somebody tell me, even if they cared about my health, you know, if I didn't want to sleep.

139
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:40,200
So, I said, how can we solve this, you know?

140
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:49,833
And then I also realized something else when the doctor told me that got all mixed up in this. say my concern for their health was about 50%.

141
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,900
And 50% was for my mental health.

142
00:15:51,900 --> 00:16:03,100
At a certain time of the evening, I just wanted some relaxation and peace and so forth.

143
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:10,633
So I said, well, you know, I'm not only concerned about your well-being, but, you know, do you know what I mean by disliking time to yourself?

144
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:11,400
They understood.

145
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:12,433
They have that same need.

146
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:15,433
So I said, how can we get everybody's needs met?

147
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,066
And then my daughter came up with it.

148
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,166
She had a great solution.

149
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:22,600
She said, Daddy, how about if we go into our room at eight o'clock?

150
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,866
Say, you can have time, but then we can go to sleep when we want.

151
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:29,233
I said, let's try.

152
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:31,300
It worked beautifully.

153
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:34,200
It worked beautifully.

154
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:43,766
The only problem was, the first night, my youngest son, age three, I heard him up until 10 o'clock.

155
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:48,533
And I had to control myself.

156
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:50,900
And then the next morning he got up real grumpy.

157
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:58,133
Then I had to hold my tongue so I didn't say, see, I told you, you don't get it.

158
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:58,600
And really,

159
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:00,266
he got it.

160
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:00,800
He got it.

161
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,100
I think one other time, he didn't get enough sleep.

162
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,800
And then everybody

163
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:11,800
got their needs met, found his own rhythm, and I got my needs met, they got their needs met.

164
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,533
So, does this answer that?

165
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:21,766
Yeah, but I'm just curious about that there's a certain age where you can't have that dialogue.

166
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:29,966
It's about that the child is capable of taking some responsibility of his own.

167
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:33,533
Sometimes when they're not able to, like we lived on a busy street,

168
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:40,466
And I didn't want them to take responsibility for how and when to go across the street.

169
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:46,533
So one day I'm out mowing the lawn and my three year old starts running across the street.

170
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:51,366
And I go and grab him and I try to explain to him the danger of that.

171
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:56,366
So sometimes we need to use the protective use of force.

172
00:17:57,533 --> 00:17:59,333
Never the punitive use of force.

173
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,166
Never punishment.

174
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:07,133
So I said to him, if I see you running the street again, I'm so afraid of you getting hurt, I'll put you in the yard.

175
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,100
Now, the yard had a fence around it that he couldn't open.

176
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,166
Now, this was not a prison.

177
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,500
It had a slide in it.

178
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:18,566
It was a very nice place, but it was a protective use of force.

179
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:27,633
So, if I feel the person doesn't have whatever the understanding that it takes to really

180
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:34,566
make a life-serving choice, I may use a protective use of force until they get it.

181
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,533
How about watching, if they want to watch more TV?

182
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:42,900
If they want to what?

183
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,333
Watch more TV.

184
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,733
If they want to watch more TV.

185
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,300
I'm both glad and sad that I didn't have the consciousness about TV when my children were younger

186
00:18:55,466 --> 00:19:06,466
because I would not have had a TV if I had seen the dangers of TV, what it does to the consciousness of people and so on.

187
00:19:06,466 --> 00:19:08,633
So you're saying what if they want to watch more TV?

188
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:13,966
First I would really try to explain what programs I'm concerned about.

189
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:26,500
and why, and see if we could get some agreements, at least on which ones, and then the amount.

190
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:43,566
And here I might be, here might be a time when I would be sufficiently concerned about the effects that television has, because television is a very dangerous narcotic, even for adults.

191
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:50,400
We have in the United States a disease, a rampant disease called couch potato.

192
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,166
Do you know what a couch potato is?

193
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,533
I have one at home.

194
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:11,433
Do you know how many hours a week the average adult watches television in the United States?

195
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:21,733
That was a frightening amount, do you remember what it was?

196
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,500
Do you mean throughout their life?

197
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,666
No, no, just during the week, per week.

198
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:32,100
Forty, I think.

199
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,266
It was, I'll look it up tonight.

200
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:36,933
It was, I couldn't believe it.

201
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,933
About nine years of the average American's life is used up watching television.

202
00:20:46,466 --> 00:20:52,000
Yeah, they turn it on when they get home at six, right after dinner, and then watch it until eleven.

203
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:57,366
So it's about five a night and seven times five, about thirty-five hours a week.

204
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,000
The housewives a little more.

205
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:12,233
And what they're watching during that time is designed to turn your brain into something else beside a brain.

206
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:16,666
So it's a dangerous, dangerous narcotic.

207
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:22,533
So I would really want to try to communicate this to the children as best I could.

208
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:26,533
But I'm so concerned about it now, I'd probably use protective use of force.

209
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:33,966
I would have some technical friend of mine designed to have the set go off every night at a certain time.

210
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:49,766
Not to punish them, but just to protect against having their brains turned into a couch potato.

211
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,433
I have another question.

212
00:21:55,433 --> 00:22:05,500
I noticed when we were doing the exercise that when I went into the forgiveness, parts of myself were forgiven, and then other parts of myself went back into the guilt.

213
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,733
I see a cycle.

214
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:12,066
I know that that's something that I do quite a bit more like a cycle where

215
00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:16,200
I can forgive myself for the moment, the next moment goes back into the guilt.

216
00:22:16,766 --> 00:22:20,200
Then you probably haven't empathized enough, you haven't mourned well.

217
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,533
See, you just keep having the guilt, I shouldn't do it.

218
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:27,133
But if you hear the need behind that, that's mourning.

219
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:29,700
It's no longer, you won't feel guilt.

220
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:39,600
You cannot feel depression, anger, guilt or shame when you're connected to life.

221
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,866
Or, in my definition, being connected to life means when you're in touch with your needs.

222
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:55,766
So, I've asked many very depressed people, who are very good for building up your income if you're in private practice,

223
00:22:56,666 --> 00:23:02,333
because 41% of pharmaceutical sales in the United States are for anti-depressant medicine.

224
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:08,733
41% of pharmaceutical sales are for anti-depressant medicine.

225
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:13,700
So now, does this mean we have a disease called depression that's rampant?

226
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,700
Or are we systematically educating people in a way that makes it inevitable that almost

227
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:26,866
everybody will be depressed and the people who end up getting called bipolar, just they're better at being depressed than the others?

228
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,366
So I would ask this question of people and they would come in to see me for depression.

229
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:38,700
I'd say, can you tell me what needs of yours aren't getting met to your satisfaction?

230
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:41,533
I'm a failure.

231
00:23:43,366 --> 00:23:46,500
Really, this would be exactly the kind of answer I usually get.

232
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:56,133
I'm a poor mother, you know, I've been working, you know, my brother is this and I'm just this.

233
00:23:57,933 --> 00:24:00,700
I'd ask for needs, but they're not in touch with needs.

234
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,333
You go up and think there is.

235
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,200
If you want to be depressed, be a man and think there's such a thing as a competent man.

236
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,866
If you want to be depressed, be a woman and think there's such a thing as an attractive woman.

237
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:18,566
It's all it takes to be really depressed.

238
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:30,333
But if you really like to be depressed, not just semi-depressed, not only think of what is wrong with you, but compare yourself to others.

239
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:38,266
And if you don't know how to do that, get a hold of a book called How to Make Yourself Miserable, by Dan Greenberg.

240
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,833
Now, this book really produces, you think you can get yourself depressed, but boy, if

241
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,066
you read this book, you can really get depressed.

242
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:53,233
For example, one of the exercises in the book, one of the chapters, is how to compare yourself to others.

243
00:24:55,433 --> 00:25:00,066
And in this chapter, the first thing you see as you turn to it is a picture of a man and

244
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:06,866
a woman by contemporary standards who would be judged as quite attractive.

245
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:13,133
Now they're without clothes, and they have all of their measurements on the picture.

246
00:25:15,466 --> 00:25:17,600
The exercise is this.

247
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:23,633
Take your measurements, compare them to these attractive people, and

248
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:26,800
And think about the difference.

249
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:35,666
Now, you know, some books promise that they don't produce.

250
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:39,966
Now, you do this exercise and it produces.

251
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,633
You'll be about as depressed as you think you can get until you turn the page.

252
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,900
Now, when you turn the page, the author says, now this was just a warm-up

253
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:53,933
Because we all know that beauty isn't that important.

254
00:25:54,666 --> 00:26:01,833
Now let's compare ourselves to other people on things that are important, such as achievement.

255
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,933
So to help you in this exercise, the author claims to do this.

256
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:17,933
He said, I have called people at random from the phone book and asked them what they have achieved in their lives, at what age they are.

257
00:26:19,466 --> 00:26:24,533
and now you can compare yourself to these people.

258
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:37,466
Now here is where I'm not sure I trust the author of this book because the first person he claims to have called at random from the phone book was Mozart.

259
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,666
But there were some interesting facts about Mozart I never knew like how many languages

260
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:48,800
could speak by age eight, I forget the number, and how many pieces of music he subsequently

261
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,100
wrote that have been handed down over the centuries as masterpieces.

262
00:26:53,133 --> 00:27:10,466
Now, compare what you've achieved at your stage in life with what Mozart did by age eight, and think about the difference, you see.

263
00:27:10,466 --> 00:27:16,933
And you'll get this kind of indoctrination moment by moment watching in the television, of course, because this is showing you

264
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:25,566
what the normal, appropriate, attractive, competent, successful human being is doing, what they have, what they own.

265
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:32,100
See, that's why I made sure I always have long sleeves, because I don't want people to see I don't have a Rolex.

266
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:37,233
I feel ashamed about that.

267
00:27:49,966 --> 00:27:53,633
So, any other question about that exercise?

268
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,866
I have a question on need.

269
00:27:59,866 --> 00:28:07,000
I was wondering whether the need for reciprocity or mutuality could be labeled as a need.

270
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:17,233
I've got an example, like in a couple, if I'm opening up or doing this or working on myself to find the responsibility for my actions,

271
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,900
I am kind of expecting my partner to do so.

272
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,900
If I talk about a need for reciprocity, is that...

273
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,966
I would say the very fact that you have an expectation makes it not a need.

274
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:31,533
Yeah, yeah, okay.

275
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:33,066
That's what I had to kind of...

276
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,933
Yeah, so what's the need behind it?

277
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:44,766
I'm guessing that for caring, the need for caring, to feel cared for.

278
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:48,566
Isn't that closer to it?

279
00:28:48,566 --> 00:28:50,333
Just that you want him to do it because you do it?

280
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,166
Now some things I think we do have a need for fairness.

281
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,933
that need.

282
00:28:58,966 --> 00:29:08,633
But, see now, here's where language comes in again, like, if I say to another person I have a need for fairness, they're very, very likely to hear I'm calling them unfair,

283
00:29:08,933 --> 00:29:15,266
because that implies I might think there's such a thing as fair and unfair.

284
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:21,700
So, to really find a vocabulary that really captures the need without being easily heard as a criticism,

285
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,233
I keep working at it.

286
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,600
But as I said earlier, most of the time I use street giraffe.

287
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:32,966
I don't use classical giraffe.

288
00:29:33,433 --> 00:29:38,000
I think that if I use certain language, people can kind of sense what the need is.

289
00:29:39,366 --> 00:29:45,033
And it's more what they are comfortable hearing than if I put it into a more classical form.

290
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:48,433
We'll work on that as we work on how to be honest.

291
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:59,466
to be honest both in a street way, an idiomatic way, and how to at times be more formal about it.

292
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:08,433
See, we were all speaking perfect giraffe, perfect non-violent communication for about the first several months of our lives, really.

293
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:17,666
Like when you were nine months old and your need for hunger wasn't being met in the middle of the night.

294
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:24,766
You didn't wake up and say to your parents, parents, how could you be so insensitive?

295
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,900
I haven't eaten in four hours.

296
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:31,733
Get your lazy butt out of the bed and feed me.

297
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:32,733
How did you communicate?

298
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,200
Street giraffe, see?

299
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:42,900
Your parents could sense what you were feeling and needing it.

300
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:47,400
You didn't learn that violent language until you were educated.

301
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:50,366
So you see, how violent can just a natural language.

302
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:54,366
We're trying to communicate to other people the best way we can,

303
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:57,200
what needs of ours are met and aren't being met.

304
00:31:02,966 --> 00:31:06,866
Okay, let's continue with this transforming the language.

305
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,033
Now let's get angry.

306
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:11,766
Let's get real angry.

307
00:31:19,433 --> 00:31:27,600
And for those of you who are so nice that you never get angry, so that you can participate in this exercise,

308
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:38,033
I will give you my brother's telephone number, and if you go and call him, you'll be angry within 10 minutes, and come on back and you can be...

309
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,033
What is he doing?

310
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:42,766
What does he do?

311
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:53,933
The last time I actually, he's a very nice guy, the last time I saw, one of the last times I saw him, I said, how do you, how does it feel for you to be famous all over the world?

312
00:31:54,066 --> 00:31:55,033
He said, huh, what do you mean?

313
00:31:55,066 --> 00:31:58,700
And I told him how I make mention of him in every workshop.

314
00:32:00,466 --> 00:32:01,900
And he was very disappointed.

315
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:03,300
Nobody has ever called him.

316
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:15,166
Everybody has somebody that triggers off their anger.

317
00:32:19,066 --> 00:32:19,166
Okay.

318
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:20,700
So you got this person in mind.

319
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:25,500
Somebody who really can stimulate your anger.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,266
你必须衡量每个人的需求被满足的程度

321
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:15,733
但为此 你必须明确我们为了拥有一个和平、和谐、健康的社区需要满足哪些需求

322
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:22,100
因此 他和他的同事们做了很多工作 试图问自己 我们的需求是什么

323
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:34,400
他们找到了答案 他的名字是曼弗雷德 首字母缩写M-A-N-F-R-E-D 他的姓是马克斯·内夫

324
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:38,600
这是一个连字符的名字 M-A-X连字符N-E-E-F

325
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:51,566
经过研究 他们提出了九个需求 决定测量以看看一个经济体是否成功

326
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:55,700
他可以衡量这些需求被满足的程度

327
00:00:57,566 --> 00:01:02,800
第一个 他称之为生存 第一个需求 生存

328
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:15,133
实际上 在我看来 这涉及到大约四到五个不同的需求 但他把它们都归为一个

329
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:23,333
而我会用我的方式称它们 不是用“生存”这个词 而是说基本的物质需求

330
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:29,866
空气、水、食物、住所、衣物

331
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:36,400
基本的物质需求

332
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:47,533
他的第二个需求是安全、保护

333
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:53,066
第三个需求是爱

334
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,200
第四个需求是理解

335
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,166
我更喜欢用“共情”这个词 但他用的是理解

336
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,200
接下来是创造力

337
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:16,400
接下来是娱乐

338
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,766
他在这一点上包括了玩耍、休息

339
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,700
所以 娱乐、玩耍、休息

340
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,700
接下来 他称之为社区

341
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:39,033
我更喜欢德语词汇“geborgenheit”

342
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:42,100
用英语来说 我会说“温暖的巢”

343
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,800
温暖的社区

344
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,566
温暖

345
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,600
Geborgen

346
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,333
感觉怎么样……

347
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,266
嗯 你可以这么看 但他的意思不同

348
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,666
他有一种不同的衡量方式

349
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:09,866
然后是两个我认为如果我们真正衡量成为一个完全的人类 感觉真正成为人类

350
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,466
这两个需求非常重要 这就是自主性

351
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:26,833
随便哪天看看报纸 看看世界各地几乎每天都有多少战争在进行

352
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,566
人类不希望别人过来说

353
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,733
我有权控制你

354
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:36,766
然而 大多数教师认为控制学生是他们的工作

355
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,966
大多数经理人认为控制员工是他们的工作

356
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:46,400
所以你会看到学校里教师和学生之间的战争

357
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:53,333
它在管理者与员工之间起作用 在家庭中父母与孩子之间也是如此

358
00:03:54,533 --> 00:04:05,333
如果你想听听自主权之争 晚上可以走到一个有很多孩子的社区 听听那些房子里的声音 你会听到自主权之争在进行

359
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:09,666
你会听到一个家长对一个三岁的孩子下命令

360
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:11,133
该睡觉了

361
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:13,300
三岁孩子 不！

362
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,466
自主权之争 你看

363
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:22,100
他们认为自己的工作是让孩子们表现得守规矩

364
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,566
老师认为他们的工作是让孩子们守规矩

365
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:29,033
经理人认为他们的工作是让人们守规矩

366
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,800
我的孩子教会了我这是多么愚蠢

367
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:38,066
他们教会我的第一件事 我不能强迫他们做任何事

368
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:42,766
我所能做的只是让他们希望他们做了

369
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:53,333
然后他们告诉我 每当我这么做时 他们会让我希望我没有让他们希望他们做

370
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,100
所以一旦我明白这点 我们就不会有自主权之争了

371
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:03,300
然后那个维克托·弗兰克尔称之为人类最重要的需求 从成为一个真正进化的人的角度看

372
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:09,200
是对意义的需求 对目的的需求

373
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:20,833
但当然 如果你像大多数人那样接受教育 你会把对意义的需求和金钱混为一谈

374
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:28,333
你会把对意义的需求和金钱或地位混为一谈

375
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:32,666
你会认为你的工作职位满足了对意义的需求

376
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,833
那第九个需求被混淆了

377
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,666
哦 是的 这是我们的文化真正想搞砸你的地方

378
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,133
他们想让你认为你对意义的需求可以通过你开的更大的车来满足

379
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:53,666
所以他们把策略都和你赚的钱混为一谈

380
00:05:54,100 --> 00:06:00,666
如果你想读一本我觉得非常有力的书 关于我们的文化如何系统地搞乱我们的思想

381
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:10,533
把这个重要的对意义的需求与消费文化希望我们渴望的东西混为一谈 可以读读迈克尔·勒纳的书

382
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,766
他的名字是 L-E-R-N-E-R

383
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:33,466
迈克尔·勒纳 书名叫《精神很重要》 英文名 在书中详细讲述了我们的文化是如何系统地误教我们混淆需求和策略的

384
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,500
《精神很重要》

385
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:56,266
这就是为什么非暴力沟通的一个重要部分是帮助人们不将需求与满足需求的策略混为一谈 因为你看 把这些分开是相当困难的

386
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:06,000
例如 如果你生活在美国 看过电视超过10分钟 你会认为你需要一份麦当劳汉堡

387
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:13,133
你无法想象没有每天一份麦当劳汉堡的人能在我们这个星球上生存

388
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:25,200
你怎么能想到 从你还是个孩子的时候 你就看到这些精心制作的广告在15分钟的节目中出现两三次

389
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,233
而且它以一种方式呈现 让孩子缠着父母带他们去麦当劳

390
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:54,066
所以如果你明白了这一点 那么我们的大脑很快就会被想要我们将需求与我们的策略混淆的企业世界扭曲

391
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:05,633
所以为了发展你的词汇 我所做的 这对我很有帮助 我浏览了那九个需求的列表

392
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:19,566
我用来捕捉那九个需求的词汇与曼弗雷德·马克斯·内夫使用的不同 所以我把它们翻译成我自己会用来自我交流的语言

393
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,733
这对我来说与那九个需求产生共鸣

394
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:29,733
然后我说 现在 我该如何在和一个三岁孩子交谈时表达这些需求

395
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:38,033
所以我想出了可能的方式 因为 看 所有人类都有相同的需求

396
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,533
这很重要 要意识到 所以每个人

397
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:48,500
所以三岁孩子有自主的需求 但我怀疑很多三岁孩子会使用那个词

398
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,366
那我该如何向我正在与之交谈的三岁孩子传达这种需求呢

399
00:08:56,733 --> 00:09:00,733
当我和街头帮派打交道时 我该如何表达这九个需求

400
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,666
当我和大学教授们一起工作时 如果我们需要清晰表达某事

401
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:20,933
那将是如何表达这九个需求 以及如何在对方使用的任何语言背后听出这些需求

402
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:30,866
因为对很多人来说 需求越重要 他们知道的表达需求的方式就是这样

403
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:37,600
问题在于 所以很多需求都是以这种方式表达的 特别是

404
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:45,533
那些人最绝望的需求 所以我还做了一个练习

405
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:55,666
我选择了从他人那里传来的最令人恼火的信息 然后练习猜测背后可能的需求

406
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,433
那个人的需求是什么

407
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:06,100
所以我努力工作 以便能够看到 任何曾经听起来像批评的东西

408
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:11,366
它实际上是未满足需求的一种糟糕表达

409
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:18,533
所以每当听起来像是批评时 我知道这是一个练习将判断转化为需求的机会

410
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:27,533
每当我想要批评时 就是将批评转化为我未满足的需求的时候

411
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:34,533
还有其他关于这个话题的评论或问题吗

412
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:35,700
是的

413
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:43,900
我有一个问题 因为我想知道 一个三岁孩子是否也是这样

414
00:10:48,366 --> 00:11:03,333
我想知道 爱的需求 不 一个三岁孩子需要被确认 或被看见 或......

415
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:20,700
而三岁孩子表达被看见的方式可能是间接的 比如说 我不想去睡觉

416
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,133
嗯 如果孩子这样说 我不想去睡觉 如果他们用那种语气 我会猜测需求是自主

417
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:39,966
因为 你看 如果父母只是单纯地想让他们上床睡觉 那么你就不能使用非暴力沟通

418
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:46,400
如果你有单一的目的 你永远不能使用非暴力沟通

419
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:54,833
我们只有在我们的目标是创造连接时才能使用非暴力沟通

420
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,633
这种连接允许通过富有同情心的给予和接受来满足每个人的需求

421
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:13,900
如果我的目标是满足我自己的需求 我在德克萨斯州达拉斯的一个机场坐着 旁边坐着一个带着三岁孩子的女士

422
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:20,866
这个孩子 我就坐在那里大约20分钟 一动不动 大概三岁

423
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:27,533
最后 一个坐在女士附近的老年女士说 我从没见过这么有礼貌的孩子 就这么坐在那里

424
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,200
母亲说 是的 我学到了养育孩子的秘诀

425
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:34,566
确保你有饼干

426
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:38,700
她有一盒饼干和一个拍子

427
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:39,900
她有一个乒乓球拍

428
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:46,733
所以当孩子按她的意愿坐着时 她就给他一个饼干 但如果他起来了 就打他

429
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:53,300
所以这就是大多数教师和父母受到的教育 你知道 饼干和拍子

430
00:12:53,466 --> 00:13:00,500
所以如果你的目标是让某人按你的意愿做事 就不要学习非暴力沟通

431
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:09,033
去参加一个训狗学校 训狗学校 看看他们是如何训练狗的 奖励

432
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,166
那你该如何确保三岁孩子得到足够的睡眠

433
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:33,033
你知道 这是一个问题 我在美国参加一个与大学负责医疗保健的医生们的研讨会时自己看到的

434
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:35,700
我正在和他们举办一个研讨会

435
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:51,966
那时 每天晚上 我们家都有睡觉时间战争 试图让三岁、四岁和七岁的孩子按时上床睡觉 为了他们的健康

436
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:57,966
真正帮助我的是 和一位医生共进午餐 这位医生对我说

437
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:03,133
你知道我们大学最大的健康问题是什么吗 Marshall?

438
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:03,966
我说 不 什么

439
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:12,800
那就是18岁的年轻人来到大学 在这18年间父母不断告诉他们晚上几点该睡觉

440
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:17,966
他们根本不听他们的身体 也不知道什么时候该睡觉

441
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:25,933
他们整晚都不睡觉 大约第二个月的学期我们就有一大堆生病的人

442
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,433
我说 你刚刚帮我解决了我家的睡前问题

443
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,066
他问 你是什么意思

444
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:38,900
我说 我以为我每晚都是为了他们的健康让他们上床睡觉

445
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,733
现在你帮我意识到我从未告诉过我的狗什么时候该睡觉

446
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,900
狗没有生病

447
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:52,166
那我的孩子们是不是比狗还不聪明

448
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,333
所以我回家后和他进行了以下对话

449
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,866
真的 这是一个真实的故事

450
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:09,766
我对他说 看 我想我还没有清楚地说明为什么我希望你晚上上床睡觉

451
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:10,966
有谁知道

452
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,333
我一再告诉他 但他还是没明白

453
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:19,833
我又说了一遍 我关心你的健康 你知道 这就是为什么我希望你睡觉

454
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:20,000
是

455
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:27,500
我的大儿子说 但爸爸 有时候我们那时候还不困

456
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,700
嗯 这对我来说是有道理的

457
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,866
我不希望有人告诉我（该什么时候睡） 即使他们关心我的健康 在我还不想睡觉的时候

458
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:40,200
所以 我说 我们怎样才能解决这个问题

459
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:49,833
然后我还意识到了一些其他事情 当医生告诉我这件事时 我意识到我的担心大概50%是为了他们的健康

460
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,900
另外50%是为了我的心理健康

461
00:15:51,900 --> 00:16:03,100
到了晚上的某个时候 我只是想要一些放松和安宁

462
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:10,633
所以我说 你知道吗 我不仅仅是关心你们的幸福 也希望你们理解 我自己也需要一些时间 你们明白这意味着什么吗

463
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:11,400
他们理解了

464
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:12,433
 

465
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:15,433
所以我问 我们怎样才能满足每个人的需求

466
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,066
然后我的女儿提出了一个好主意

467
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,166
她说：“爸爸 我们八点去房间里怎么样

468
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:22,600
这样你可以有时间 我们也可以在想睡的时候再睡 ”

469
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,866
我说：“我们试试看 ”

470
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:29,233
效果非常好

471
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:31,300
效果真的很好

472
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:34,200
唯一的问题是 第一天晚上

473
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:43,766
我三岁的小儿子 我听到他一直玩到十点钟

474
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:48,533
我得控制自己

475
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:50,900
第二天早上他起床很烦躁

476
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:58,133
那时我必须忍住不说：“看吧 我早就说过 你们不懂 ”

477
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:58,600
其实

478
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:00,266
他明白了

479
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:00,800
他懂了

480
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,100
我想只有一次 他睡眠不足

481
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,800
之后每个人

482
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:11,800
都能满足自己的需求 找到了自己的节奏 我满足了我的需求 他们也满足了他们的需求

483
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,533
那么 这回答了你的问题吗

484
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:21,766
嗯 但我好奇的是 有些年龄段你无法进行这样的对话

485
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:29,966
这是因为孩子能够承担一定的责任

486
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:33,533
有时候他们做不到 比如我们住在一个车流繁忙的街道上

487
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:40,466
我不希望他们自己决定何时何地过马路

488
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:46,533
有一天我在修剪草坪 我三岁的孩子开始跑向街道

489
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:51,366
我跑过去抓住他 试图向他解释这样做的危险

490
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:56,366
因此 有时我们需要使用保护性的力量

491
00:17:57,533 --> 00:17:59,333
绝不使用惩罚性的力量

492
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,166
绝不是惩罚

493
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:07,133
所以我对他说 如果我看到你再跑到街上 我非常害怕你会受伤 我会把你放在院子里

494
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,100
现在 院子周围有一道他打不开的围栏

495
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,166
这不是监狱

496
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,500
里面有滑梯

497
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:18,566
这是一个很好的地方 但这是一种保护性的使用力量

498
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:27,633
所以 如果我觉得这个人没有足够的理解能力

499
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:34,566
去真正做出对生活有益的选择 我可能会使用保护性的力量 直到他们明白为止

500
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,533
那如果他们想看更多的电视呢

501
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:42,900
如果他们想做什么

502
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,333
看更多的电视

503
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,733
如果他们想看更多的电视

504
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,300
我对此感到既高兴又遗憾 如果我在孩子们小时候就意识到电视的危险

505
00:18:55,466 --> 00:19:06,466
我就不会买电视 因为我已经看到了电视对人们意识的影响等等

506
00:19:06,466 --> 00:19:08,633
所以你是说 如果他们想看更多的电视呢

507
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:13,966
首先我会尽力解释我关心哪些节目

508
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:26,500
以及为什么 看看我们是否能就哪些节目以及观看的数量达成一些协议

509
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:43,566
这里可能是我会足够关注电视的影响的时候 因为电视对成人甚至也是一种非常危险的麻醉品

510
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:50,400
在美国 我们有一种疾病 一种猖獗的疾病 叫做“沙发土豆”

511
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,166
你知道什么是沙发土豆吗

512
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,533
我家就有一个

513
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:11,433
你知道美国成年人每周平均看电视多少小时吗

514
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:21,733
那是一个惊人的数字 你记得是多少吗

515
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,500
你是说他们一生中的时间吗

516
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,666
不 不 只是每周 每周的时间

517
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:32,100
我想是四十小时

518
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,266
是的 我今晚会查一下

519
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:36,933
是的 我简直不敢相信

520
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,933
美国人平均一生有大约九年的时间在看电视

521
00:20:46,466 --> 00:20:52,000
是的 他们下班回家后六点打开电视 晚饭后一直看到十一点

522
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:57,366
所以大约每晚五小时 五乘以七 大约三十五小时一周

523
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,000
家庭主妇可能还要多一些

524
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:12,233
而他们在这段时间内观看的内容设计是为了将你的大脑变成除了大脑以外的东西

525
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:16,666
所以这是一种非常危险的麻醉品

526
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:22,533
所以我真的想尽我所能向孩子们传达这一点

527
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:26,533
但现在我对此非常担忧 我可能会使用保护性措施

528
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:33,966
我会让我的技术朋友设计一种设置 使电视机每晚在某个时间自动关闭

529
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:49,766
这不是为了惩罚他们 而是为了防止他们的大脑变成沙发土豆

530
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,433
我还有一个问题

531
00:21:55,433 --> 00:22:05,500
我注意到当我们进行练习时 当我进入到宽恕阶段时 我的一部分自我被宽恕了 然后其他部分又回到了内疚中

532
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,733
我看到了一个循环

533
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:12,066
我知道这是我经常做的事情 像一个循环

534
00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:16,200
我可以在一瞬间宽恕自己 但下一刻又回到内疚中

535
00:22:16,766 --> 00:22:20,200
那你可能还没有足够地同理 你还没有好好地悼念

536
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,533
看吧 你还在持续感到内疚 我不该这么做

537
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:27,133
但如果你听到那背后的需求 那就是悼念

538
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:29,700
那时你就不会感到内疚了

539
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:39,600
当你与生命连接时 你就不会感到抑郁、愤怒、内疚或羞愧

540
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,866
或者 按照我的定义 与生命连接意味着你与你的需求保持联系

541
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:55,766
所以 我问过许多非常抑郁的人 他们对于私人执业非常有帮助

542
00:22:56,666 --> 00:23:02,333
因为在美国 41%的药品销售是抗抑郁药

543
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:08,733
美国41%的药品销售是抗抑郁药

544
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:13,700
那么 这是否意味着我们有一种名为抑郁症的流行病

545
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,700
或者我们是否在系统地以一种方式教育人们 使得几乎所有人都不可避免地会感到抑郁

546
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:26,866
而被诊断为双相情感障碍的人只是更擅长于感到抑郁

547
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,366
所以我会问那些来找我治疗抑郁的人这个问题

548
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:38,700
我会说 你能告诉我哪些需求没有得到满足 让你感到不满意吗

549
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:41,533
我是个失败者

550
00:23:43,366 --> 00:23:46,500
真的 这通常是我得到的答案类型

551
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:56,133
我是个糟糕的母亲 你知道 我一直在工作 我的兄弟是这样 而我只是这样

552
00:23:57,933 --> 00:24:00,700
我会问需求 但他们没有接触到需求

553
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,333
你去想想吧

554
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,200
如果你想感到抑郁 做个男人 并认为有所谓的能干的男人

555
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,866
如果你想感到抑郁 做个女人 并认为有所谓的有魅力的女人

556
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:18,566
这就足以让人非常抑郁了

557
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:30,333
但如果你真的想感到抑郁 不仅仅是半抑郁 不仅要认为自己有问题 还要与他人比较

558
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:38,266
如果你不知道怎么做 可以找来一本名为《如何让自己痛苦》 作者是丹·格林伯格的书

559
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,833
这本书真的能让你抑郁 你以为你会抑郁 但如果你读这本书 你真的会抑郁

560
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,066
例如 书中的一个练习 一章是如何与他人比较

561
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:53,233
在这一章 你一翻到那页就会看到一幅男人和女人的图片 按照当代标准 他们会被认为非常有吸引力

562
00:24:55,433 --> 00:25:00,066
他们没有穿衣服 并且图片上有他们的所有测量数据

563
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:06,866
现在他们没有穿衣服 而且图片上标注了他们的各种尺寸

564
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:13,133
练习是这样的

565
00:25:15,466 --> 00:25:17,600
进行测量 将你的尺寸与这些有吸引力的人进行比较

566
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:23,633
然后想想差异

567
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:26,800
然后想想其中的差异

568
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:35,666
你知道 有些书承诺了很多但并没有实现

569
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:39,966
这本书做了这个练习 它就能实现

570
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,633
你会感到自己可能达到的抑郁程度 直到你翻开下一页

571
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,900
现在 当你翻到下一页时 作者说 这只是个热身

572
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:53,933
因为我们都知道美貌并不那么重要

573
00:25:54,666 --> 00:26:01,833
现在让我们比较一下自己和其他人在重要的事情上的表现 比如成就

574
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,933
为了帮助你进行这个练习 作者声称要这么做

575
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:17,933
他说 我随机从电话簿里叫了人 问他们一生中都取得了什么成就 他们现在多大年纪

576
00:26:19,466 --> 00:26:24,533
现在你可以将自己和这些人比较

577
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:37,466
现在我开始不太相信这本书的作者 因为他声称随机从电话簿中第一个打给的人是莫扎特

578
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,666
但有一些关于莫扎特的有趣事实我以前不知道的 比如他八岁时会说多少种语言

579
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:48,800
我忘了具体数字 以及他后来写了多少音乐作品

580
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,100
这些作品几个世纪以来一直被视为杰作

581
00:26:53,133 --> 00:27:10,466
现在 比较一下你在人生这个阶段所取得的成就和莫扎特八岁时的成就 想想这之间的差异 你会看到的

582
00:27:10,466 --> 00:27:16,933
而你会在看电视的时候 一刻不停地接受这种灌输 因为这在向你展示

583
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:25,566
正常的、合适的、有吸引力的、有能力的、成功的人在做什么 他们拥有什么 他们拥有什么

584
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:32,100
看 这就是为什么我总是确保穿长袖 因为我不想让人们看到我没有劳力士手表

585
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:37,233
我对此感到羞愧

586
00:27:49,966 --> 00:27:53,633
所以 关于那个练习还有其他问题吗

587
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,866
我有一个关于需求的问题

588
00:27:59,866 --> 00:28:07,000
我想知道是否可以将互惠或互利的需求归为一种需求

589
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:17,233
我有一个例子 比如在一对夫妻中 如果我在开放自我或努力寻找自己行为的责任

590
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,900
我有点期望我的伴侣也这么做

591
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,900
如果我谈论对互惠的需求 那是不是...

592
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,966
我会说你有期望的事实本身就说明它不是一个需求

593
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:31,533
是的 好的

594
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:33,066
这就是我必须要...

595
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,933
那么 背后的需求是什么

596
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:44,766
我猜是关于关怀的需求 感受到被关怀

597
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:48,566
这不是更接近吗

598
00:28:48,566 --> 00:28:50,333
只是因为你做了 你希望他也这么做

599
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,166
有些事情我认为我们确实有对公平的需求

600
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,933
那种需求

601
00:28:58,966 --> 00:29:08,633
但是 看现在 语言又起作用了 比如 如果我对另一个人说我有对公平的需求 他们很有可能会认为我在说他们不公平

602
00:29:08,933 --> 00:29:15,266
因为这意味着我可能认为有公平和不公平之分

603
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:21,700
所以 真正找到一种既能表达需求又不容易被当作批评的词汇

604
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,233
我一直在努力

605
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,600
但正如我之前说的 大部分时间我使用街头长颈鹿语言

606
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:32,966
我不使用经典长颈鹿

607
00:29:33,433 --> 00:29:38,000
我认为如果我使用某种语言 人们可以某种程度上感知到需求是什么

608
00:29:39,366 --> 00:29:45,033
这更多是关于他们能舒服地听到什么 而不是我把它放入更典型的形式

609
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:48,433
我们会在我们学习如何诚实的过程中继续努力

610
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:59,466
诚实地 用街头的方式 用常用语的方式 以及有时如何更正式地表达它

611
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:08,433
看 我们在生命的前几个月都在完美地使用长颈鹿语言 完美的非暴力沟通 真的

612
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:17,666
就像你九个月大时 如果你夜里感到饿了

613
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:24,766
你不会醒来对你的父母说 父母 你们怎么这么不体贴

614
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,900
我已经四个小时没吃东西了

615
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:31,733
赶紧起床 懒货 给我吃的

616
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:32,733
你是怎么沟通的

617
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,200
街头长颈鹿 看到了吗

618
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:42,900
你的父母能感觉到你的感受和需要

619
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:47,400
在你受教育之前 你还没有学会那种暴力语言

620
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:50,366
所以你看 自然语言是多么的暴力

621
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:54,366
我们试图以最好的方式向他人传达

622
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:57,200
我们的哪些需求得到了满足 哪些没有

623
00:31:02,966 --> 00:31:06,866
好 我们继续用这种方式转化语言

624
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,033
现在让我们生气

625
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:11,766
让我们真正生气

626
00:31:19,433 --> 00:31:27,600
对于那些你们中那些太温和而从不生气的人 以便你们能参与这个练习

627
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:38,033
我会给你们我的兄弟的电话号码 如果你去打给他 你会在10分钟内生气 然后回来你可以...

628
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,033
他在做什么

629
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:42,766
他做了什么

630
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:53,933
上次我实际上 他是个非常好的人 上次我见到他时 我说 你觉得在全世界都很有名是什么感觉

631
00:31:54,066 --> 00:31:55,033
他说 嗯 你是什么意思

632
00:31:55,066 --> 00:31:58,700
我告诉他我在每个研讨会中都提到他

633
00:32:00,466 --> 00:32:01,900
他非常失望

634
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:03,300
没有人曾经给他打过电话
