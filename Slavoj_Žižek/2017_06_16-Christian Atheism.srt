1
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:25,633
What I want to say is that I think that what I call Christian atheism is still the ethical stance which fits today's predicament.

2
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:32,933
Okay, let me begin with a a simple observation.

3
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:44,233
Those who follow obscure spiritual cosmological speculations have for sure heard of one of the most popular topics in this domain.

4
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:52,166
You know all these mythical stories that when three planets, usually Earth, Moon and the Sun, find themselves along the same axis,

5
00:00:52,700 --> 00:01:08,600
then some big cataclysmic event takes place, the whole order of the universe is momentarily thrown out of join, and the universe has to find a new balance.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,366
You remember that it wasn't taken seriously, but the panic of 2012, where idea is to some

7
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:24,599
Maya, old Mayan predictions precisely because I think Earth, Moon and Sun were in the same line. It's not good.

8
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:35,800
And I think that politically something like this holds for this year, 2017, which is a triple anniversary.

9
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:45,166
In 2017, we do not celebrate only the centenary of the October Revolution, 1917, but also

10
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,800
the 150th anniversary of the first edition of Marxist Capital, 1867, and maybe the most tragic event,

11
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:10,233
the 50th anniversary of the so-called Shanghai Commune, when in the climactic moment of the Chinese great proletarian cultural revolution.

12
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:17,266
It's a wonderful moment, maybe the crucial moment of 20th century communism.

13
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:19,733
Residents of Shanghai, workers and students,

14
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:28,300
decided to take literally Mao's call, you know when Mao said attack the headquarters,

15
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:31,933
You don't need neither the party nor the army.

16
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,233
People should take over.

17
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:45,366
Well, they took this literally and simply overthrew offices, destroy of local communist party, ignored the army, and took over.

18
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:51,499
And that was the crucial point because then Mao had to send the army.

19
00:02:52,300 --> 00:03:01,233
and it's an extremely tragic event because this was then, people don't know this, the biggest battle of the Cultural Revolution.

20
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:11,333
Forget about, okay, they were tragic, all those things, you know, red guard discs pulling their beard, terrorizing professors, intellectuals, all that.

21
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:19,199
No, it was the battle for Shanghai when the army turned on the very revolutionaries.

22
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:27,200
And one don't know how many the idea is that it goes into tens, if not hundreds of thousands of dead people.

23
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:41,066
But I think this event is fascinating because I don't like this big question, was Mao since here or not?

24
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:42,633
At a certain level, he was not.

25
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:51,899
It's clearly that he triggered the Cultural Revolution to regain his full power in the army, sorry, in the state.

26
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:55,233
But it doesn't matter if Mao was manipulating.

27
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:57,066
Things ran out of control.

28
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,766
Ordinary workers took it seriously.

29
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,266
Let's have directly the rule of the community.

30
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,866
We don't need the party, we don't need the army and so on, and it went too far.

31
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:14,499
So I think these three events mark the three stages of the communist movement.

32
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:21,666
First, capital by Marx outlined the theoretical foundations of the communist revolution.

33
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:31,766
Then the October revolution was the first successful attempt to overthrow bourgeois state and build a new social economic order.

34
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:42,999
And then the Shanghai commune stands for the most radical attempt to immediately realize the most daring aspect of the communist vision,

35
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:51,633
the abolishment of state power and the imposition of direct people's power organized as a network of local communities.

36
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:58,366
It didn't work, and of course, I will not answer the question today, namely the big question, what went wrong?

37
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:05,433
I think, that's my hypothesis, what went wrong with this cycle?

38
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:13,733
Perhaps the answer is to be solved, and people don't talk about it, but for me at least, as a Christian, it is the key date.

39
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:21,066
Don't you know that today we have another, We have four planets in the line. Another mega anniversary.

40
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:35,999
2017 is the 500 years anniversary of 1517 when Martin Luther put on that door the 95 thesis, Protestantism.

41
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,833
And I still think that Protestantism is the key, the greatest religious event that you can imagine.

42
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:43,400
Why?

43
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:48,333
Let me begin in a very simplified way,

44
00:05:48,666 --> 00:06:01,133
but I'm not totally bluffing, because I presented a version of this text at a theological colloquium in Cambridge, and it went well.

45
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,966
What can I say?

46
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:03,966
So I'm not totally bluffing.

47
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:05,199
I'm not totally bluffing.

48
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:13,633
Let me begin by this triad of orthodoxy, Catholicism, and Protestantism.

49
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:16,499
The way I see it, maybe I'm wrong,

50
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:25,166
central to the Orthodox tradition is the notion of theosis, of man becoming like God,

51
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:29,533
or to quote Saint Athanasius of Alexandria, quote,

52
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:38,366
she, Christ, or God, was incarnate so that we might be made God, end of quote.

53
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,433
What should otherwise seem absurd,

54
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:50,099
that fallen sinful men may become holy as God is holy has been made possible through Jesus Christ who is God incarnate.

55
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,600
And then Saint Maximus the Confessor wrote in the same vein, again a quote,

56
00:06:57,366 --> 00:07:04,499
a sure warrant for looking with hope to deification of human nature is provided by the incarnation of God,

57
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,566
which makes man God to the same degree as God himself became man.

58
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:14,833
Let us become the image of the one whole God,

59
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,800
bearing nothing earthly in ourselves,

60
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:21,799
so that we may consort with God and become gods,

61
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:27,199
receiving from God our existence as gods, end of quote.

62
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:36,766
This orthodox formula, God became man, so that man becomes God,

63
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:41,966
is, I think, what Protestantism radically rejects.

64
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:51,533
The deepest insight of Protestantism, although it's implicit already in the Bible, is that, to put it very simply,

65
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:55,866
God become man and that's it, nothing more.

66
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,333
Everything already happens in the incarnation.

67
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,866
What needs to be added is just a shift of perspective.

68
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:10,066
I think that in authentic Christian vision, there is no resurrection to follow.

69
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,766
Holy ghost already is resurrection.

70
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,766
Resurrection happens in the Christian community.

71
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,633
God dies and he remains dead.

72
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,299
We are condemned to freedom.

73
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:30,166
Holy community is not, there is, I read here, Christianity in a radically atheist way.

74
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:33,266
Holy ghost is not some kind of a synthesis.

75
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:35,699
God, man, and then they are brought together.

76
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:42,533
No, with crucifixion, precisely that type of God, you know, this primitive idea.

77
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:50,033
Up there, there is a great old guy with a long beard who takes care of us, so don't worry too much.

78
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,766
Ultimately, we are taken care of.

79
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:55,766
That's what Hegel, my favorite, puts it nicely.

80
00:08:55,833 --> 00:09:01,366
He says, what dies on the cross is not an earthly representative of God.

81
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,233
It's God himself, that God of beyond.

82
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,566
So what remains?

83
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,866
We in our freedom.

84
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:10,799
And that would be the properly Christian trick.

85
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,833
I say God gave us all freedom and so on.

86
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,933
He said, but he didn't.

87
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:21,133
God abandoned, he just creates that and let us alone, God abandoned us.

88
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:24,066
I'll say, but that's another name for freedom.

89
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,499
You should just shift the perspective.

90
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:36,366
Or to put it in another way, and I'm here, I am basing my reading on some very good theologies from my beloved Chesterton onwards.

91
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:44,399
In other religions, to simplify it very much, you have got men.

92
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:47,199
We have fallen from God.

93
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:54,199
So the idea is let's climb back to some stupid spiritual exercises, whatever you want.

94
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,233
Like let's get rid of our sinful nature.

95
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,366
go back to God the Christian solution is a totally different one it is this one

96
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:10,266
okay let's say you an ordinary believer find yourself totally abandoned by God

97
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:24,466
so what's the way out of it not okay let me do some good works or self-punishment to become clean no it's that at that point when I'm totally abandoned by God

98
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:33,899
I identify with Christ who finds himself in exactly the same position with the famous Father, Father have you forsaken me.

99
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:54,433
So that it's a wonderful insight that you should see in a very Hegelian way how our separation, we overcome our separation from God, not by rejoining God, but by realizing that this separation is sepa

100
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:59,133
That at that point, we are divine.

101
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:08,899
Because again, the ultimate moment of divinity is that moment of, as Gilbert Keith Chesterton put it, the moment when God himself becomes an atheist.

102
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:17,899
You know, because remember, on the cross, when Christ says, Elie Elie lama sabachthami gavadar, he for a brief moment becomes a non-believer.

103
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,900
which is a crazy moment.

104
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,966
You find this in no other religion.

105
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,933
In other religions, you do find men who abandon God.

106
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,433
Where do you find God who abandons himself?

107
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:36,066
And again, the Christian solution is not you suffer, you are low, but don't worry, there are good news.

108
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:38,566
No, there are no good news.

109
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,233
Good news are only a different shift of perspective on the bad news.

110
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,399
We remain abandoned by God.

111
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:47,899
God will not come to save us.

112
00:11:48,366 --> 00:12:01,899
As even conservative theologists who are not stupid knew, like Paul Plodel, my favorite French conservative Catholic, he says very nicely that the ultimate secret of Christianity is not trust God.

113
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,099
Things may look bad, but God will help you.

114
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:06,933
No, it's the opposite.

115
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:08,266
God needs our help.

116
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,466
Only we can save God.

117
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:20,733
In other words, the divine, and some theosophic speculation, I will not go into it, we don't have time to lose here,

118
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:32,499
develop this in a wonderful way where they claim that the secret of reincarnation is not that God did something heroic to redeem us.

119
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:38,333
God, God without incarnation is not fully God.

120
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,066
God incarnates himself in man to become fully God.

121
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:49,433
That's the solution of one of my favorite, apart from Hegel, German idealist Schelling, who developed in his Heidegger claim, know that these two texts, especially Freichheitschrift,

122
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,733
who developed in his Heidegger claim, know that these two texts, especially Freichheitschrift,

123
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,733
Schelling's text on the essence of human freedom,

124
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:03,799
and later Weltalter fragments on the ages of the world,

125
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:18,000
he developed this how God produced logos, gave birth to Logos' son, Schelling literally said this, to save himself from his own madness.

126
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:27,966
It was, if I may be cynical, a kind of, you know, psychiatrists say if you are caught in psychosis, you need creative therapy, you know, through work.

127
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,300
Well, that's what God did.

128
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,966
And some very, if you think I'm bluffing,

129
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:40,166
some very intelligent Protestant theologists came to the same conclusion.

130
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:50,799
Like, a Norwegian friend of mine gave me a reference and he translated some parts to me because it's not a well-known book, famous only in Norway.

131
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:58,199
The guy's name is Peter Wessel Zakve, a book on Protestantism God.

132
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:01,633
It's a reading of Book of Job.

133
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,700
And you know what's his reading?

134
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:20,366
What does Job discover when he encounters God, when he realizes that God is doing very strange things, punishing him for nothing, and so on?

135
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:32,533
Here is a quote from Zapfel, Job finds himself confronted with a world ruler, God, of grotesque primitiveness,

136
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:41,366
a cosmic cave-dweller, a braggart and blusterer, almost agreeable in his total ignorance of spiritual culture.

137
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:48,433
What is new for Job is not God's greatness in quantifiable terms, that we knew fully in advance.

138
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:52,599
What is new is God's qualitative baseness.

139
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,666
And I think this is masked insight also of the big Protestant topic of predestination.

140
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:06,599
You mean God was simply playing a brutal game with us, he didn't care.

141
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:15,533
God decided in advance, you are redeemed, you are lost, totally irrespective of what we are doing.

142
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:17,499
And I think this is the right line.

143
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:34,199
I think that, as intelligent Protestants saw it, this Catholic way of linking our salvation to our good works introduces immediately an element of handling, of financial transaction.

144
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:41,166
I see that child drowning, should I do it or not, well, I may gain salvation, so fuck it, why not do it, you know?

145
00:15:42,466 --> 00:15:47,633
It makes our good deeds part of a almost, I would say, financial investment into future.

146
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:57,266
But as Luther put it very intelligently, if there is predestination, then the solution is pure goodness.

147
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:10,466
Because you see a child drowning, sorry for this pathetic example, and you know very well that it will not help your salvation in any way if you help the child or not.

148
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:21,133
So it's only goodness that makes you do it.

149
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:30,700
So let's go on here.

150
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:37,833
In this position where the solution is not some kind of a reunification of God with men,

151
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:47,766
We overcome our alienation of God through a simple realization that God is already alienated from himself, self-abandoned.

152
00:16:49,200 --> 00:17:02,566
I like to apply here to divinity Hegel's wonderful reading of ancient Greek statues which are impenetrable for us, like what does the Sphinx mean?

153
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:04,499
And you know what's Hegel's formula.

154
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:11,666
The secrets of ancient Greeks, secrets for us, were already secrets for ancient Greeks themselves.

155
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:26,399
And Hegel's theology is precisely this one, that the secrets of divinity are secrets also for divinity itself.

156
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,333
This is the old mystical topic.

157
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,966
Hegel goes there into that line.

158
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:40,366
You find it in Meister Eckhart and all other guys that to bring history into God himself,

159
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:49,233
what happens on our earth, our theological activity, decides the fate of God himself in a way.

160
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,400
It's the other way around.

161
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,566
It's not that God decides, no.

162
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,033
We in our struggles, we fight for the fate of God himself.

163
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:07,633
So how to bring this, and now it comes, maybe it will be a little bit difficult, the proper theological point.

164
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,033
I think I improvised a little bit already in my classes about this.

165
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:19,766
Does this mean that Protestantism simply abolishes our freedom?

166
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:26,099
Everyone who knows Luther, and I don't have the time to go into it, but I have it written,

167
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:37,400
a detailed analysis of the tension between Martin Luther and, of course, Thomas Münzer, the great theologist of the German peasant revolt.

168
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,033
Maybe this will surprise you, but I'm almost more on the early Luther's side.

169
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:50,899
He was right, Münzer, in criticizing Luther for his confirmation taking the side of the masters, and so on.

170
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:55,999
But Mincer, I think, comes all too close, then,

171
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:02,066
to this perverse instrumental position which comes close to totalitarianism.

172
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:10,266
Because Luther was right, and this was his greatest theological insight, to insist on divine impenetrability,

173
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,133
which, written in a materialist way, doesn't mean God knows what he is doing, we just cannot penetrate it.

174
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,566
It means that quote from Sapwe, God is crazy, doesn't know it.

175
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:27,599
So Luther warned against precisely what we call today fundamentalism.

176
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,566
Any position of an agent, historical, who, my God, what is happening here?

177
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:40,399
I'm getting superstitious. Yesterday it was one, at least they are not black cats and we will survive there.

178
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,899
But it's the Maoist movement, one divides into two.

179
00:19:45,133 --> 00:20:00,133
Okay, sorry, let's go on, that Luther comes too close to this, seeing his political movement as direct instrument of the divine will, and this is what Luther is right to prohibit.

180
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:10,066
She insists on this radical impenetrability, there is predestination, but we never know what is predestination.

181
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:17,533
Like our lives are decided in advance, but we cannot ever know it.

182
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:31,166
So it's absolutely prohibited to claim I am an instrument of the divine will, like the Stalinist communists in a different way, historical necessity of progress towards communism runs through me.

183
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,833
No, we cannot do it.

184
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,666
And I think this is authentic freedom.

185
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:43,533
This idea of my life is predestined, but I don't know what it is.

186
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:47,966
So this terrible struggle to make the right decision.

187
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,633
Because you know, here common sense doesn't work.

188
00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:56,099
Because common sense would tell us, why do you worry?

189
00:20:56,466 --> 00:21:02,733
If there is predestination, sit down and masturbate and watch hardcore movies, it doesn't matter.

190
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:13,566
No, the idea is that this also, that it doesn't work, explains, we all know it, I'm even repeating myself, I think years ago, I was already selling this here, I'm sorry,

191
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:30,566
because this also explains this paradox of predestination and freedom, explains the greatest mystery of this old Max Weber thesis, why is Protestantism as a religion which is based on predestination,

192
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:47,766
Why Protestantism became the religious background, at least originally, of capitalism, which is precisely the most active social system, a system where you are solicited to be active like crazy all the time.

193
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:56,466
Again, wouldn't it be logical to claim, if it's predestined, fuck off, I lay down, awaken me when God comes, but leave me alone.

194
00:21:58,033 --> 00:22:09,966
Weber saw this clearly and Luther, that precisely because you don't know it, knowing that your faith is decided but not knowing what your faith is, pushes you to incessant activity

195
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:19,166
and I think that this decision, this difficult decision to discover if there is predestination,

196
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:30,466
faith necessity, what is that faith, is much closer to authentic freedom than, I'm using no metaphor that already used, I'm sorry for my students in my class,

197
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:40,800
then this simple freedom of, I go to a patisserie, they have strawberry cake, chocolate cake, vanilla cake, or which one I will choose, you know, this simple freedom of choice.

198
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:47,666
No, true freedom is this one, and even now you will say I'm crazy.

199
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,066
But let me give you an example to repeat that already given my class.

200
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:54,433
Think about love, the choice of object in love.

201
00:22:55,266 --> 00:22:58,433
It must be free, if not, it's not love, of course, no?

202
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:03,833
But it never happens to you, admit it, as a free choice.

203
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:09,033
If you say, oh, now I will fall in love into that lady or man, it's fake.

204
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:21,766
It is a free decision, but as Schelling put it, a transcendental, a temporal free decision which you experience precisely as its opposite, as your fate.

205
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:27,166
You experience love as, my God, I cannot escape it, I'm caught into it.

206
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,433
And that's true freedom.

207
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:29,766
That's the radical freedom.

208
00:23:30,133 --> 00:23:32,833
Now you will say, this is sentimental speculation.

209
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,300
No, I'll use another example from my class.

210
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:40,333
Isn't it exactly the same with a tough political decision?

211
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:46,599
Not the simple decisions, vote for Macron, vote for Le Pen with Puff, I don't care.

212
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:50,199
But let's make a pathetic example.

213
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:57,233
There is war, my country is attacked, and I have to decide will I risk my life, do it or not.

214
00:23:58,133 --> 00:24:00,266
This is a free decision by me.

215
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:07,433
But if you take the difficult decision that you will fight, you don't experience it as a choice.

216
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:13,000
You experience it, I would love not to do it, but it's my duty, I cannot not do it.

217
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:14,533
I have to do it.

218
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:22,999
And I think this provides this wonderful dialectic described, as far as I know, by philosophy

219
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:33,466
only nicely, clearly only by Hegel, how predestination is much more paradoxical if we read Protestantism

220
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:40,866
in a materialist way than the simple notion, there is predestination, everything is decided no.

221
00:24:41,633 --> 00:24:48,666
means we have a faith, but we retroactively create this faith.

222
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:56,233
Like I freely decide something and once I decide it, it retroactively becomes necessary.

223
00:24:56,933 --> 00:25:02,433
If I do the right thing, I experienced it my God, I couldn't do it otherwise, I had to do it.

224
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,633
That's freedom.

225
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:07,033
So that's my first point about Protestantism.

226
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:14,399
Which means that not only you are free, but you are even more free than you thought.

227
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,000
You are even responsible for your fate, for your necessity.

228
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:34,000
And again, as I already explained in my classes, here psychoanalysis rejoins Protestantism.

229
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:39,933
Because in psychoanalysis, the obvious result is something like predestination.

230
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:50,633
You know, like, I think I'm a free being, but no, everything is predetermined through my past traumas, through whatever, you know, so I discover that I'm not free.

231
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:56,566
And this was the fashionable lesson half a century ago with that fashion of structuralism in France.

232
00:25:57,033 --> 00:26:01,366
This is how psychoanalysis was read, structural psychoanalysis.

233
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:09,199
You think you are a free subject, no. You are just a puppet, the big other, the symbolic order, runs the game, and so on.

234
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:25,666
But look, Lacan follows here Freud, yes, you are over-determined, but you cannot use this over-determination or psychic necessity which makes you what you are.

235
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:30,499
You cannot use it as an excuse, you know, like, to be vulgar, I'm sorry.

236
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:35,566
I rape a child and then I say to the judges, sorry guys, what can I do?

237
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:38,666
I was over determined by my unconscious complex.

238
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:44,233
No, you are predestined by fate, but you are responsible even for that.

239
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:47,933
You are much more radically responsible.

240
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:57,999
And I can't go into it now, I already did it in my class to develop how the same goes also for, that's why it's a great thing, Kantian ethics.

241
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:01,699
And Kant says, do Kant then do souls.

242
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,633
You can do it because you must do it.

243
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:08,166
Like no excuse to not do your duty.

244
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,266
If it's your duty, you have to do it.

245
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:15,166
But Kant, this is not so often noticed, goes even a step further.

246
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:22,499
He also implies that even doing your duty cannot be an excuse for doing your duty.

247
00:27:23,033 --> 00:27:24,599
Like Chris, I hate you, let me do it.

248
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,100
I have to do something, it's my duty which will hurt you.

249
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:33,166
I don't have the right to tell you, sorry guy, but it's my duty.

250
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:36,199
No, I don't have the right to externalize it.

251
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,033
I'm not responsible only to do my duty.

252
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:45,633
I have to fully subjectively assume also my duty in the sense of what is my duty.

253
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,766
This is why incidentally, I mentioned this briefly in my class, and now I will stop with plagiarizing myself.

254
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:54,199
Don't worry, I will not repeat my class.

255
00:27:54,933 --> 00:28:00,533
This is why I think that although I admire her, at some point in her otherwise wonderful

256
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:05,699
Eichmann in Jerusalem, if I remember it correctly, Hannah Arendt was wrong.

257
00:28:06,466 --> 00:28:11,333
When she took seriously Eichmann's statement that she was just a good Kantian.

258
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:19,366
He did his duty for him, duty was embodied in Führer's orders, so sorry I was doing my duty.

259
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,100
No, Eichmann did precisely the wrong thing.

260
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:30,966
He was not a Kantian because he did something that Kant strictly prohibits.

261
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:37,933
He used duty as an excuse, sorry, I kept killing millions of Jews, what can I do, that's my duty.

262
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:45,099
No, you cannot refer to your duty as some objective determination that you have just to follow.

263
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,666
You are radically responsible for your duties.

264
00:28:50,933 --> 00:28:53,966
Now I will complicate things.

265
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,933
Now the end of self-pluggerizing.

266
00:28:58,033 --> 00:28:59,066
You will get some new stuff.

267
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:06,199
This solution, this dialectical interconnection of necessity and freedom, where, yes, there is necessity,

268
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:10,599
but this necessity is, in a deeper sense, contingent.

269
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,533
Like, you do something in a contingent way.

270
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,933
Once you do it, it retroactively becomes your fate.

271
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:21,433
This solution works only on one condition.

272
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:32,233
The subject, believer, agent, is absolutely constrained by the horizon of his or her finite subjectivity.

273
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:41,866
What Protestantism prohibits is the very thought that as a believer, I can, as it were,

274
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:52,833
took a position outside, above myself, and looked upon myself as a small particle in the vast reality.

275
00:29:53,533 --> 00:30:00,499
Here since I already mentioned Mao Zedong, I would like to criticize him a little bit

276
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:07,799
at the philosophical level and incidentally because of some of my lines like this, Alain Badiou is even now mad at me, you know.

277
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:21,066
Mao Zedong, I think, was wrong when he deployed his Olympic vision, reducing human experience to a tiny, unimportant cosmic detail.

278
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:30,133
You know, in his famous statement where he say we don't fear atomic war and so on, okay, with that I in principle agree.

279
00:30:30,733 --> 00:30:40,566
But Mao went on and said this, a quote from Mao Zedong, the United States cannot annihilate the Chinese nation with its small stack of atom bombs.

280
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:56,466
Even if the US atom bombs were so powerful that, when dropped on China, they would make a hole right through the earth, or even blew the earth up, that would hardly mean anything

281
00:30:56,833 --> 00:31:01,966
to the universe as a whole, though it might be a major event for the solar system.

282
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,366
You know, it's kind of a weird excuse.

283
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:11,599
OK, Americans can destroy us, but what does it mean from the standpoint of the universe or whatever?

284
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:23,966
I think that this argument, Mao's, only works if in a pseudo-Kantian way.

285
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:34,533
We presuppose, like, the problem is, where is Mao speaking from what subjective position when he states this.

286
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:46,266
He acts as if he speaks from a totally external, purely divine position where you see objectively reality in human eyes, and then you can say,

287
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:53,633
okay, our Earth is blown apart, fuck it, a tiny blimp in some small planet, who cares?

288
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:00,166
But here I don't have time to develop it, but this is beautiful theological topic.

289
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:12,533
Intelligent Protestantism have a wonderful vision where it's again that link between contingency and necessity.

290
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,233
On the one hand, yes, we are a tiny piece of feet in a vast universe.

291
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:36,999
Protestantism is not ethnocentric, which is why Protestantism in so far as it stands for modernity was precisely the religious background of modern science, which precisely introduced the objective view of reality.

292
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:43,500
You know that before Protestantism, the medieval world was earth in the center, although we

293
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:56,166
humans were not the center of the universe, it was God, but nonetheless, we were the highest point of the created universe, everything turned around us, and so on and so on.

294
00:32:57,033 --> 00:33:05,299
So what Protestantism unites, I don't have time to develop it now just to give an idea, is I think something wonderful.

295
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,233
At the same time, this extremely brutal view.

296
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,266
From an inhuman gaze, we are nothing.

297
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:16,766
A tiny species on Earth, it doesn't matter.

298
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:26,933
But nonetheless, since we cannot ever really assume that view, external view, in our ethical practice,

299
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:41,700
we have to act as if whenever, and Kant puts it this very nicely, although objective science is telling us that fuck it, we are again one tiny piece of dust in the universe,

300
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:55,666
Nonetheless, in a big ethical struggle, it's not just our fate that is decided, as it were, can't put it so nicely, the entire universe was created as a background for that struggle of ours.

301
00:33:56,133 --> 00:34:00,899
You know, I love this unity of extreme ethnocentrism.

302
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:09,266
The world was created so that we can fight this battle, and this radically external view.

303
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:17,733
Because this is, in a way, when you witness a big change, a revolution or whatever, even

304
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:25,733
with Holocaust, I think the intelligent argument, even Habermas made it, who tries to be a rationalist,

305
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:39,733
but Habermas, I don't agree with him, made once a nice point where he says that with Holocaust, and I would add nonetheless some other events, like what happened in Congo, other horrible things and so on.

306
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:49,933
Something so horrible happens that you in a way diminish its horror when you reduce it to a simple human event.

307
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:59,400
Something went wrong in class struggle, whatever, it's horrible to say Holocaust was just a sub-chapter in class struggle and effort and so on.

308
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:15,100
Something that Habermas says very intelligently that theological dimension means here just a way, a specific way, to signal that something so horrible happened that it doesn't fit our universe.

309
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:23,166
We cannot, I'll put it this way, we cannot simply renormalize it as just another historical event.

310
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:42,333
That's why, isn't this the title, you may correct me, maybe you know it more, of one of the books on Holocaust, The Black Sun, the sun itself turned out, you know, like Like as some people say nicely, when something like Holocaust happened, it's a shame that the world continued to exist.

311
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:48,799
If there were to be an elementary ethic in the world, out of shame the world should have fallen apart.

312
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:58,699
So that's, and now comes, I thank you for your patience, maybe my first more interesting aspect.

313
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:06,166
It's part of this, that's the paradox of Protestantism, radically anthropocentric,

314
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:10,766
but at the same time let's look at ourselves with inhuman eyes.

315
00:36:11,933 --> 00:36:22,899
Here I think, but I'm reading them, by them I mean assemblage theory, new materialism, object-oriented ontology, they can be combined with my position.

316
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:32,699
Because what's the true, let's call it naively, shattering ethical greatness, although I read it in a different way that it's usually read off.

317
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:46,866
I will focus here on so-called new materialism, Jane Bennett, this idea that we should look at our life in the middle of nature as an interaction of agents.

318
00:36:48,066 --> 00:37:02,999
She calls them, I think, following Latour actants, and they interact and we should look at it through an inhuman gaze, to see this as a process of interaction, living interaction,

319
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,533
we are just one of the elements.

320
00:37:06,233 --> 00:37:15,099
In her book, I think, Vibrant Matter, Jane Bennett provides a beautiful description of a trash site.

321
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:19,966
She said, we think trash side just nothing, piece of sheet there, things rotting.

322
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,200
But she says, what if we look at it with an imagined inhuman eye as a living process?

323
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:43,833
We have a complex interaction of rotting trash, worms, insects, abandoned machines, chemical poisons, and each place, each element, actant, plays its own never purely passive role.

324
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:55,666
I think, so-called new materialism or object-oriented ontology at its most radical, to provide this type of inhuman view.

325
00:37:57,333 --> 00:38:03,099
And again, I think there is an authentic theoretical and ethico-political insight in such an approach.

326
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:21,899
Society thereby becomes a social phenomenon, but the limits of sociality are expanded to include all material bodies participating in the relevant assemblage.

327
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:34,333
Say, an ecological public is a group of bodies, some humans, most of them not, and they are subjected to harm defined as a diminished capacity for action.

328
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:50,966
Of course, the ethical implication is that we have to acknowledge the entanglement within a larger assemblage, like we are not, nature doesn't serve us, we are just one among the agents on the earth.

329
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,966
Here comes my first modest disagreement.

330
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:04,600
I think unknowingly this argument of her description also remains radically anthropocentric.

331
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:23,799
know in what sense, the more it tries to be objective at the level of content, the more it privileges us, human species, as the only species which has access to this universality.

332
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:40,166
That's my problem with those so-called deep ecologists who claim animals, even a Scandinavian friend of mine, wrote a book where he claims even beautiful canyons, pieces of nature,

333
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:54,566
should be treated as subject agents with human rights, like there is a beautiful organic totality in, he gives a beautiful example of wonderful rock formation in Iceland,

334
00:39:54,633 --> 00:40:06,533
and he says not only, as it's popular to say now, animals should have their rights, not just human rights, priests should have their rights, even rivers should have their rights.

335
00:40:06,566 --> 00:40:07,533
But you know what's the catch?

336
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:09,166
They don't know it.

337
00:40:09,633 --> 00:40:18,366
We automatically, when we want to act as deep ecologists, is the most arrogant, anthropocentric position that you can imagine.

338
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:25,066
Because you automatically assume that we, yes, we apparently humiliate ourselves.

339
00:40:25,766 --> 00:40:33,166
But we humans are the only agents who know, who have access to this universal dimension.

340
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,266
I mean, trees don't know about their rights.

341
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:43,133
When a river is ruining the trees, it doesn't know that it is infringing upon others' rights.

342
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:58,033
You know, it's the same falsity as the one, I think, of a certain type of multiculturalism where we claim that we are not the only ones who have the right.

343
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,833
Also, other cultures have the right.

344
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:06,499
But the more we humiliate ourselves of Western civilization, we are just one among them,

345
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:17,900
the more we act as the only one who has the access to the universal dimension and can say what the rights of the other such.

346
00:41:18,866 --> 00:41:22,599
I felt this quite often in debates in the United States,

347
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:29,966
its typical arrogant, politically correct attitude, that, and once I witnessed it,

348
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:35,766
a white liberal guy, of course they're always white, defended black rights.

349
00:41:36,033 --> 00:41:38,199
That's perfect, I'm radically for them.

350
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,733
But the problems were what that some black guys then didn't agree with him.

351
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:49,266
And basically he started to shout at him, like, you don't know what are your rights, I will tell you.

352
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:57,433
That's the hidden arrogance which, and I think it's the same problem with those who sympathize with refugees and so on and so on.

353
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,700
That's why I find suspicious

354
00:42:03,566 --> 00:42:06,599
this eternal self-humiliation of Europeans.

355
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,866
I called it a reversed white man's burden.

356
00:42:10,133 --> 00:42:23,999
You know, white man's burden is an old English expression, colonialist, for we white people are tasked by nature, God, whomever, our burden is to lead other nations to civilized life, whatever.

357
00:42:24,733 --> 00:42:31,299
Now we have the opposite version of white man's burden, which is I think also a refined racism.

358
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:40,566
Whenever something happened in third world country, slaughter like Rwanda, it has to be an effect of colonialism.

359
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:46,333
And I have an African friend from Nigeria who got the point and exploded.

360
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,833
He said, you are such racist Europeans.

361
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,366
You don't even allow us to be genuinely evil.

362
00:42:54,066 --> 00:43:00,733
You treat us as such innocent children that you know whenever we do something wrong, it must be your guilt.

363
00:43:00,766 --> 00:43:02,699
This is the new version of white man's burden.

364
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,733
Let's look around.

365
00:43:04,133 --> 00:43:05,966
There is a slaughter in Kampuchea.

366
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:08,233
Oh, it must be an effect of colonialism.

367
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,400
OK, let's go on.

368
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:16,299
Now things will get even much nastier.

369
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:23,233
I hear Jane Bennett, if she were to be here, would have exploded.

370
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:37,000
My ultimate example of assemblage would be not as a cheap provocation, not please don't misunderstand me, to read assemblage theory as proto-fascist, quite the opposite, that

371
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:47,900
I'm even tempted, but I'm afraid I would be even more attacked than I am, to write a short text on describing Auschwitz as an assemblage.

372
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,833
Let's forget about human suffering.

373
00:43:51,266 --> 00:44:04,433
Let's look Auschwitz as a collaboration between humans, victims, worms, fire there and so on, a kind of objective process of material interaction.

374
00:44:09,466 --> 00:44:21,466
And we can say not only the Nazis were agents, inmates were the agents, worms who ate the corpses if there were some, if they were not properly burned, were agents, and so on and so on.

375
00:44:22,166 --> 00:44:22,766
And we can do it.

376
00:44:23,533 --> 00:44:28,366
But now another philosophical point, I am so sad I don't have time to develop it.

377
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:43,433
What we get here, and now I will turn to Gilles Deleuze, towards whom I am critical but he is a genius, has ingenious insights, Deleuze said that his thinking tries to construct

378
00:44:43,733 --> 00:44:51,466
a quote from Deleuze, a perception of reality as it was before or after man, humanity.

379
00:44:52,466 --> 00:44:57,299
a perception released from its human coordinates.

380
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:05,266
He says we should view reality as quote iridescent chaos of a world before man.

381
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:12,033
Now I claim this doesn't mean cosmological speculation, how did big bang look.

382
00:45:12,633 --> 00:45:19,199
It means that take a phenomenon like Auschwitz and look at it from outside of human concerns.

383
00:45:19,933 --> 00:45:25,666
Of course, it's an, let's not misunderstand me, it's an utterly obscene vision.

384
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,466
Because in some sense, you cannot do it.

385
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:34,533
And here I come to my next point, I will be very brief, I really don't want to spend too much time.

386
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:46,899
I think that here Deleuze introduces, and he does it some, at some point he explicitly uses the terms.

387
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:57,366
the Kantian distinction between, for us, phenomenal reality and in itself, in the sense of nominal, independent of us,

388
00:45:57,966 --> 00:46:12,633
not in this naive sense that in itself is reality out there the way it really is outside our view, but in itself as, I will put it like this, an impossible phenomenon.

389
00:46:13,033 --> 00:46:17,099
The problem with the vision of Auschwitz that I gave to you.

390
00:46:18,133 --> 00:46:23,399
It's not that, you cannot claim it's bluffing that it's the way Auschwitz really was.

391
00:46:24,033 --> 00:46:28,266
And no, it's still our view, but it's impossible view.

392
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,566
It's too dramatic.

393
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:34,566
As ethical human being, we cannot afford to look at reality in that way.

394
00:46:34,966 --> 00:46:44,399
Where inmates are, the burned people there are just reduced to one among the Aktans together with worms and whatever.

395
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:57,833
So my point is this one, that what, here Claude Lanzmann, with whom I often don't agree,

396
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:06,800
I think to shock you that he's, I find it very suspicious ethically, but at some point he was right.

397
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:15,533
He wrote somewhere that if he were to discover, let's say that some Nazis say this did it,

398
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:24,466
If he were to discover reels, I mean movie, cinema, with direct shooting of the most brutal

399
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:32,599
moments of Auschwitz, you see the bodies being gassed and how in panic mother climbs upon

400
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:39,733
her child to be a little bit higher, to be gassed, you know, the most brutal moments.

401
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,266
He said, I would burn it immediately.

402
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,000
And he is right.

403
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:45,566
you see too much there.

404
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:47,066
But you see the point.

405
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:50,733
It's not that you see objective reality the way it see.

406
00:47:51,300 --> 00:48:00,833
You see a phenomenon, it's still a phenomenon, but a phenomenon which cannot be integrated into our reality.

407
00:48:00,933 --> 00:48:02,266
Okay, that's philosophy.

408
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:07,500
Now I come to the final point, which may be problematic to some of you.

409
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:17,266
At some point I got even for showing this part in London, An old lady approached me and said, basically, she demanded from me a trigger warning.

410
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,900
She said, it was too brutal, you shouldn't have shown it to us.

411
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,733
But I don't believe in this logic of trigger warning, you know.

412
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:31,599
I think that academia is not a safe place when you, where you escape harsh life.

413
00:48:32,633 --> 00:48:36,499
Academia on the contrary should confront you with brutality, you know.

414
00:48:36,933 --> 00:48:38,166
Okay, so let's go on.

415
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:49,866
In this messy world where everything is on us as ethical subjects, but at the same time, you see the paradox I'm saying.

416
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:54,100
Look for example at slavery in the United States.

417
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,900
You can provide an objective history.

418
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:04,333
It was a collaboration of black stripes in Africa who were selling the slaves, blah blah.

419
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,566
You do an objective history.

420
00:49:07,933 --> 00:49:11,366
you can do it, but it is an utter obscenity.

421
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:17,633
To do it from this neutral way, objectivity becomes an utter obscenity.

422
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:21,366
It is an obscenity to report on it in an objective way.

423
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:34,199
So again, if we try to bring together the two aspects, this rootless objectivity and at the same time utter ethical engagement, what kind of ethics do we get?

424
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:36,766
Here comes now my final example.

425
00:49:37,466 --> 00:49:47,366
One of the good aspects of globalization, I think, I really love it, is I'm not against globalization, you know what, because it's genuinely multicultural.

426
00:49:48,200 --> 00:50:04,966
By this I mean a simple thing, not multicultural in this usual left liberal sense, but in the sense that it's not only American culture and maybe French, English, also smaller nation get their chance.

427
00:50:04,966 --> 00:50:18,233
Do you remember how years ago there was a period of South Korean, Taiwanese movies, there was a period even of Romanian movies, they are very good, wonderful sense of irony and so on.

428
00:50:18,233 --> 00:50:23,566
Never forget that this is also a good effect of globalization.

429
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:30,100
It's not simply we will all eat hamburgers and watch Hollywood blockbusters.

430
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:37,500
If anything, My prediction is that one possible result of globalization will be that Hollywood will start losing.

431
00:50:37,633 --> 00:50:51,399
I mean, who still wants to watch their stupid, these blockbusters where they even cannot produce new formulas and all they can do is endless remakes of old movies and then combining them.

432
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:56,266
Now you have Batman with Superman and so on, it's despair.

433
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:03,066
So what I am to say is that I like to read the good detective novels and they are, we

434
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:07,366
have now a new wave and that's what I like, I discovered.

435
00:51:08,033 --> 00:51:21,799
It's no longer those, a couple of privileged sites, you know, like for classical Houdan in England, for hard-boiled novels, LA area or United States, maybe a little bit of France and so on.

436
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,433
Now they can happen, detective novels, literally everywhere at any time.

437
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,866
Do you know that you already have novels which take place in ancient Egypt?

438
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,733
A priest who is a detective at some stupid pharaoh's court.

439
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:41,699
You have detective novels, Stephen Saylor writes them, which happened in ancient Rome.

440
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:46,233
An acquaintance of Julius Caesar does the work.

441
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:55,266
You have one series on Alexander the Great and so on and so on anywhere, medieval, Umberto Eco started the first in medieval.

442
00:51:55,833 --> 00:52:00,999
You have them now which take place in Tibet, in Russia, and my favorite are those which

443
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:15,466
take place in extreme circumstances, like you have now a whole subspecies of detective novels which take place in two of what at least in Europe we perceive as extreme moments.

444
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:20,333
the last years of war in Germany and the harshest Stalinism.

445
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:36,399
Like now, yesterday, I finished a novel called Jim McDermot, Pennamunde, where von Braun built rockets, Deceptions, where there is a murder in 1944, one of the engineers is shot in Pennamunde.

446
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:43,200
And I love, or you have Stalinist one, 35 bodies discovered in the middle of Moscow,

447
00:52:43,666 --> 00:52:52,666
honest policeman tries to resolve the crisis but the victim is a foreigner, KGB intervenes, whole mess and okay not to get lost

448
00:52:52,700 --> 00:53:06,500
along these lines okay I will tell you a dream because nobody will want to do it I don't care if you know it my simple dream is to do a novel but honest one not cynical which takes place

449
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:18,166
in Auschwitz like inmates and one is found strangled and they are all on the the edge of dying, but one of them tries to resolve it as a murder case.

450
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,100
And then I want to do a paradoxically upbeat tragic ending.

451
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:33,999
He solves the crime, but then they all go in a well-known, to a well-known place with a big burning machine and so on.

452
00:53:34,566 --> 00:53:47,133
So along these lines, I love the new, this is old story, yesterday's news, Sweden even, even Iceland, Norway, Joe Nesbo.

453
00:53:47,666 --> 00:53:50,933
My favorite are now, thrillers come from Denmark.

454
00:53:52,033 --> 00:54:00,533
Not only novels, but also TV series, The Killing, and a series of novels which were made into films, a trilogy.

455
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,166
I want to show you a short clip from one of them.

456
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:13,833
The original title is flash and post, message in a bottle, and in English I don't know why, but it's a very good change of title.

457
00:54:14,533 --> 00:54:17,466
It was changed into a conspiracy of fate.

458
00:54:17,933 --> 00:54:29,966
Incidentally, I would love to write a text on the logic of, you know that now they no longer do it, but in the 50s and 60s, even later in some countries, they were always,

459
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:36,366
When they dubbed a movie for another country, they were changing the titles all the time.

460
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,033
For example, it's interesting, Hitchcock's North by Northwest.

461
00:54:41,533 --> 00:54:48,499
In Germany, it was quite logically their Un siegtbare Drite, the invisible third, and so on.

462
00:54:49,133 --> 00:54:55,966
My third example, sorry, I cannot abstain from playing bad taste racist jokes.

463
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,333
You know that for Brazilians, I spoke with you.

464
00:54:59,866 --> 00:55:01,599
Portuguese are stupid.

465
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,966
The idea is all the intelligent guy from Portugal went to Brazil, idiots remained there.

466
00:55:07,433 --> 00:55:10,433
So you know the story, I will not lose time, of Hitchcock's Psycho.

467
00:55:11,033 --> 00:55:20,766
The joke in Brazil is that Psycho's title was changed in Portugal into the son who was his own mother, to make it understandable.

468
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,766
So along these lines, this time it works.

469
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:36,533
The title is A Conspiracy of Faith, a Danish mar from 2016, again, a call to illegal activity.

470
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:40,266
You can immediately download it from Pirate Bay or whatever.

471
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:49,533
I will not bore you with the story, but I will show you, just a minute, please, a four or five minute clip.

472
00:55:50,633 --> 00:55:57,033
It's the story of an honest policeman who is described as a terminally depressive guy,

473
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:05,900
always in despair, of course totally 80s, and children are disappearing, they are killed in a strange, sadistic way,

474
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:23,166
and at the end he, the detective, locates the murderer, who is really a kind of ideal, passifal Aryan guy with blue long hair, a pathological murderer who thinks he's an instrument of devil, devil's son.

475
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:29,166
And his task is, he says, to destroy the faith of the parents.

476
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:36,133
It's not just to torture children, but he does this so that in presence of parents or so that parents are aware of it.

477
00:56:36,466 --> 00:56:44,333
So he says his main task is not just to torture and kill people, but to do it in such a way that it destroys their faith.

478
00:56:45,433 --> 00:56:52,699
And then some ethically quite shattering scene occurs.

479
00:56:53,266 --> 00:56:54,933
I find it beautiful.

480
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,200
Don't be too alarmed.

481
00:56:56,766 --> 00:56:58,966
If some of you trigger counterwarning,

482
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:04,266
are to be too shocked where a child is really drowned, killed.

483
00:57:05,366 --> 00:57:05,766
It's not.

484
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,733
At the end of the film, he survived.

485
00:57:07,866 --> 00:57:10,133
He was just unconscious so that you will not be too.

486
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:16,100
No, because some people at some talk, when I show this protested, how can you show this and so on and so on.

487
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:17,333
Don't be.

488
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:20,233
OK, let's show now, I think I described it enough.

489
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,999
Morissette, Moscow River.

490
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,666
Is it all show in there?

491
00:57:34,633 --> 00:57:35,299
OK, stop.

492
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:48,566
I think even the movie now loses its spirit because it's nonetheless as if after this stance, you know, God intervenes from the outside.

493
00:57:48,566 --> 00:57:51,133
But nonetheless, my point is a very simple one.

494
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:56,299
From my Christian atheist standpoint, no, the murderer is wrong.

495
00:57:56,333 --> 00:58:05,866
God was there two times when he, the detective, offered himself, take me, take me, and when the girl didn't want to stab the guy.

496
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:10,066
So this is my crazy position.

497
00:58:10,066 --> 00:58:12,966
I will try to be short not to go be short not to go too much on now.

498
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:16,000
Buy my next book where you will have all the chapter on this.

499
00:58:17,133 --> 00:58:21,266
It's called Incontinence of the Void to appear MIT Press in October.

500
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:25,666
This is what I mean by Christian atheism.

501
00:58:28,666 --> 00:58:31,466
Christ as a figure is not an active Redeemer.

502
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:38,966
It's just this impassive gaze which gives you the readiness to do it without any guarantee in faith.

503
00:58:39,566 --> 00:58:41,833
I don't read this in this cheap way.

504
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:47,999
The guy, the detective, thinks he's an atheist, but really he's the deepest believer.

505
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,066
No, he is.

506
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,633
The murderer is right, the deepest believer.

507
00:58:51,666 --> 00:58:53,033
You know, when the murderer tells him,

508
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,466
I never met a guy with such a faith as you.

509
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:03,566
But precisely because he needs no guarantee whatsoever in some higher force.

510
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:08,633
He just has to do it in a totally hopeless situation.

511
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,933
It's not that he wants to gain his place in heaven.

512
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:14,899
That's pure divine goodness.

513
00:59:15,233 --> 00:59:17,199
You see a situation, you have to do it.

514
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:20,299
It's not because your account, oh, if I save this child,

515
00:59:21,633 --> 00:59:23,633
I will be forgiven to cheat on my wife.

516
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,666
I will get a bed.

517
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:31,300
It has nothing to do with that.

518
00:59:32,633 --> 00:59:40,599
So OK, why then, now you can ask me a simple question.

519
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,966
Why do I call this Christian atheism?

520
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,966
Why don't I simply say it's a materialist ethics?

521
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:50,799
Like this, pure goodness, no guarantees.

522
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,733
Here, of course, I am a materialist.

523
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,166
No misunderstanding here.

524
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:59,533
But my good friend, I really like him.

525
00:59:59,633 --> 01:00:00,433
OK, not good friend.

526
01:00:00,633 --> 01:00:01,066
I boast.

527
01:00:01,366 --> 01:00:02,366
I exaggerate.

528
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,466
I met him two times.

529
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,099
We went along really well.

530
01:00:05,533 --> 01:00:10,266
You know Rowan Williams, the leftist ex archbishop of Canterbury?

531
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:17,699
In his book of Dostoevsky, I don't like Dostoevsky, but I like his book Williams's of Dostoevsky.

532
01:00:18,033 --> 01:00:28,666
He, among other things, I cannot restrain from briefly describing this to you, he provides the best reading that I can imagine of Dostoevsky's idiot.

533
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:35,066
You know, the usual reading of Idiot is, he's too divine for this world, a saint.

534
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,266
For Rowan Williams, it's a wonderful reading.

535
01:00:39,533 --> 01:00:44,366
And it's so deeply true, if you know the story of Dostoevsky's Idiot.

536
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:51,166
He's not pure evil, Idiot, Prince Mishkin, but something much more refined.

537
01:00:51,933 --> 01:01:00,966
There are people, and I met them, they really exist, who are really sincerely, no doubt, innocent good in themselves.

538
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:08,833
But the way they act in their social environment is that it's a kind of a wrong goodness.

539
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:14,633
They are absolutely sincerely good, but they cause catastrophe all around.

540
01:01:16,966 --> 01:01:19,466
And for example, Prince Minsky, what does he cause?

541
01:01:20,133 --> 01:01:27,133
Nastasia Filippona gets murdered by that other guy, or whatever, he causes catastrophe around himself.

542
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:43,466
Okay, the same Rowan Williams provided a wonderful definition in his book on Kostoevsky on what really is the divine dimension at its most elementary.

543
01:01:45,633 --> 01:01:56,499
And he makes a reference to four British Catholic novelists – O'Connor, Percy, Spark and Ellis – and this is what he says about them.

544
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:05,933
All four create a world in which the secular majority account of what is going on is relativized.

545
01:02:06,533 --> 01:02:19,766
But there is no simple alternative that anyone can step into by a single decision or even a series of decisions in the sense of this secular reality is shitty and there must be a higher order.

546
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:33,133
The religious dimension of this fiction lies in the insistent sense of incongruity, unmistakable even if no one within the fiction can say what we should be congruent with.

547
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:53,500
So it's just that our world is out of joint, inconsistent, lacking something, but it's literally negative theology, not negative theology in the usual sense, God is so much beyond that we cannot describe it properly, no, it's simply God is just this absence.

548
01:02:54,700 --> 01:03:00,466
The empty place comes before what we fill it in through our images of God.

549
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:12,133
The basic divine dimension is this void, just this void, in the sense of our reality is something is terribly wrong with this reality.

550
01:03:12,566 --> 01:03:16,466
And I think not only we can think weak,

551
01:03:17,433 --> 01:03:24,566
we can think this in a materialist way, but the only proper way is to think in a materialist way.

552
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,766
And here things get complicated.

553
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:35,166
Here we should reject, you know, one of the most famous formula of Marx, that religion is the opium of the people.

554
01:03:36,266 --> 01:03:39,033
First, be careful, Marx does not say for the people.

555
01:03:39,466 --> 01:03:41,633
This would be way too vulgar for Marx.

556
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:45,966
It's not that, as in a certain naive form of enlightenment,

557
01:03:46,633 --> 01:03:58,833
some evil priests are fabricating religion the way drug dealers like from Colombia, sorry, my bad, I'm so sorry, are fabricating.

558
01:03:58,966 --> 01:04:00,499
No, it's of the people.

559
01:04:00,866 --> 01:04:05,099
But you know what's my main argument against this formula today?

560
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:10,699
Yes, we have a religion which works as the opium of the people.

561
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:17,499
Of course, the terrorist fundamentalist religion, but never forget, not just in Muslim countries.

562
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:19,366
I'm here a radical pessimist.

563
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:28,899
You know that FBI has under observation in United States two million Christian fundamentalists suspected of being potentially terrorists.

564
01:04:29,266 --> 01:04:33,899
I'm sorry to tell you that's basically the same percentage as among Arabs, you know.

565
01:04:34,433 --> 01:04:44,566
So the question should not be just to be Islamophobic, it should be what is it in the dialectic of modern global capitalism that pushes people towards fundamentalism.

566
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:53,933
But OK, this is kind of also maybe a version today of the opium, religion as the opium of the people.

567
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,566
But there are at least two others, and I think Adorno already says this somewhere.

568
01:04:59,266 --> 01:05:02,099
We have two other opiums of the people.

569
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,133
You will guess, I hope, which are they.

570
01:05:04,666 --> 01:05:05,833
Opium and people.

571
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:10,266
For populists, their opium is people themselves.

572
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,666
You know this phantasmatic image, people, and so on.

573
01:05:14,366 --> 01:05:17,099
Marine Le Pen's opium are the people, and so on.

574
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:19,766
The true French people threatened by.

575
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,733
And the other opium of the people is opium.

576
01:05:23,866 --> 01:05:26,799
For many intellectuals, opium is drugs.

577
01:05:27,033 --> 01:05:28,733
It's opium, as you know.

578
01:05:29,666 --> 01:05:36,833
So the way to get out of it, I am for a religious dimension, but in this purely abstract way,

579
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:48,266
and I don't have time to do it, a wonderful reading can be given in this sense to link, since these guys are Danish people, to link with the obvious person, with Kierkegaard,

580
01:05:49,000 --> 01:06:04,866
whose formulas of religion, when he says God is not something we relate to, God is relating itself, and all those formulas who at least I think come to the edge of a certain type of very paradoxical materialism.

581
01:06:05,133 --> 01:06:13,799
I don't want to bore you too much, and I hope you will not protest again against this politically correct madness I've shown you too much.

582
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:27,300
My God, if you, I, you know, also when I talk about rapes, people claim you shouldn't talk in such plastic terms or whatever, you know, that it's shocking.

583
01:06:27,866 --> 01:06:32,833
Fuck you, it should be shocking, you know, because if you just abstractly describe it,

584
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:38,900
then it doesn't really affect you, then it's just, oh, it's like bureaucratic statistics, you know.

585
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:42,333
No, you should be shocked by the horrors which go on.

586
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,833
Thanks very much for your kind patience.

587
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:25,633
我想说的是 我认为我所谓的基督教无神论仍然是符合当今困境的伦理立场 

588
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:32,933
好吧 让我从一个简单的观察开始 

589
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:44,233
那些追随晦涩的精神宇宙论推测的人肯定听说过这个领域最流行的话题之一

590
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:52,166
这些神话故事 当三个行星 通常是地球、月球和太阳 找到自己沿着同一轴线时 

591
00:00:52,700 --> 00:01:08,600
那么一些大的灾难性事件就会发生 整个宇宙秩序会瞬间被打乱 宇宙必须找到新的平衡 

592
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,366
你们记得么 之前的玛雅人的古老语言 虽然它并没有被当真 

593
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:24,599
但在2012年也引起了一些恐慌 因为他们认为是地球、月球和太阳处于同一条线上是不好的事情

594
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:35,800
我认为 从政治上讲 今年 2017年 这种情况同样适用 这是一个三重纪念日 

595
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:45,166
2017年 我们不仅仅庆祝十月革命百年纪念 1917年 

596
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,800
还有马克思《资本论》第一版发行150周年纪念 1867年 也许是最悲剧的事件 

597
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:10,233
所谓的SH公社50周年纪念 当时是东印度伟大的无产阶级Cultural Revolution的高潮时刻 

598
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:17,266
这是一个奇妙的时刻 也许是20世纪共产主义的关键时刻 

599
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:19,733
SH的居民 工人和学生 

600
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:28,300
决定把Mao的号召当真 你知道当Mao说攻打司令部时 

601
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:31,933
你既不需要party也不需要军队 

602
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,233
而应该由人民接管 

603
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:45,366
好吧 他们把这当真了 简单直接地推翻了办公室 摧毁了当地communist party的办公室 无视了军队 并接管了 

604
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:51,499
这是一个关键点 因为然后Mao不得不派军队 

605
00:02:52,300 --> 00:03:01,233
这是一个极其悲惨的事件 因为当时人们不知道 这（会）是Cultural Revolution中最大的一场战斗 

606
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:11,333
忽略之前那些--虽然它们也是悲剧性的--所有那些事情（小打小闹） 你知道 red guard discs拔须 恐吓教授、知识分子 所有那些 

607
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:19,199
SH的那场战斗（不是这样） 当军队转而对抗真正的革命者 

608
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:27,200
人们无法知道准确的统计报告 死者是数万还是数十万 

609
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:41,066
但我认为这个事件很吸引人 因为我不喜欢这个大问题 Mao是否真诚？

610
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:42,633
在某种程度上 他不是 

611
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:51,899
很明显 他引发Cultural Revolution是为了在国家中重新获得他的全部权力 

612
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:55,233
但Mao是否在操纵并不重要 

613
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:57,066
事情失控了 

614
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,766
普通工人把它当回事了 

615
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,266
我们直接让社会来统治 

616
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,866
我们不需要党 我们不需要军队等等 它走得太远了 

617
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:14,499
所以我认为这三个事件标志着共产主义运动的三个阶段 

618
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:21,666
首先 马克思的《资本论》概述了共产主义革命的理论基础 

619
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:31,766
然后 十月革命是第一次成功的尝试 推翻资产阶级国家并建立新的社会经济秩序 

620
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:42,999
接着 SH公社代表了立即实现共产主义愿景最大胆方面的最激进尝试 

621
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:51,633
废除国家权力 实施直接人民权力 以地方社区网络的形式组织 

622
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:58,366
它没有成功 当然 我今天不会回答那个大问题 即出了什么问题？

623
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:05,433
我认为 这就是我的假设 这个周期出了什么问题？

624
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:13,733
也许答案是有待解决的 人们不会谈论它 但至少对我来说 作为一名基督徒 这是关键日期 

625
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:21,066
难道你不知道今天我们还有另一个--我们有四个行星排成一线--又一个重大纪念日 

626
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:35,999
2017年是1517年500周年纪念 当时马丁·路德在那扇门上贴出了新教的95条论纲 

627
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,833
我仍然认为新教是你能想象的最关键的宗教事件 

628
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:43,400
为什么？

629
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:48,333
让我从一个非常简化的方式开始 

630
00:05:48,666 --> 00:06:01,133
但我并不是完全在吹牛 因为我在剑桥的一个神学研讨会上展示了这篇文章的一个版本 它进行得很顺利 

631
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,966
我还能说什么呢？

632
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:03,966
所以我并不是完全在吹牛 

633
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:05,199
我并不是完全在吹牛 

634
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:13,633
让我从东正教、天主教和新教的三重体开始讲起 

635
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:16,499
我认为 也许我错了 

636
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:25,166
东正教传统的核心是神化的概念 人变得像上帝一样 

637
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:29,533
或引用亚历山大的圣亚他那修的话 引号 

638
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:38,366
她 基督或上帝 成为肉身（具体化） 以便我们可以成为上帝 引号结束 

639
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,433
这可能看似荒谬 

640
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:50,099
堕落有罪的人可以通过耶稣这位神的化身 变得像上帝一样圣洁 

641
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,600
然后圣马克西穆斯修士以相同的方式写道 再次引用 

642
00:06:57,366 --> 00:07:04,499
上帝道成肉身为我们带来了以希望看待人性神化的确凿保证 

643
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,566
这使得人能够在同样的程度上成为神 正如上帝自己成为了人 

644
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:14,833
让我们成为全能神的形象 

645
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,800
内在不带任何尘世之物 

646
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:21,799
以便我们能与神为伍并成为神 

647
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:27,199
从神那里接受我们作为神的存在 引号结束 

648
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:36,766
这个东正教公式 上帝成为人 是为了人可以成为上帝 

649
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:41,966
我认为 这是新教彻底拒绝的 

650
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:51,533
新教最深刻的洞见 虽然它已经隐含在圣经中 是非常简单地说 

651
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:55,866
上帝成为人 就这样 没有更多 

652
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,333
一切已经在化身中发生了 

653
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,866
需要添加的只是一个视角的转变 

654
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:10,066
我认为在真正的基督教视野中 没有所谓的复活 

655
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,766
圣灵（本身）已经是复活 

656
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,766
复活发生在基督教社区中 

657
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,633
上帝死了 他仍然是死亡的 

658
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,299
我们被宣判去获得自由 

659
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:30,166
圣灵社会不是--我在这里读到--基督教采用了一种彻底的无神论方式 

660
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:33,266
圣灵不是某种综合体 

661
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:35,699
（圣灵不是）上帝 人 然后它们被汇集在一起 

662
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:42,533
不 通过十字架上的钉死 正是那种类型的神 那种原始的观念...

663
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:50,033
在天上 有一个伟大的老人 有着长长的胡须 他照顾着我们 所以不用太担心 

664
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,766
最终 我们会被照顾的 

665
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:55,766
黑格尔--我最喜欢的--表达得很好 

666
00:08:55,833 --> 00:09:01,366
他说 在十字架上死去的不是上帝的地上代表 

667
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,233
而是上帝本身 那个超越的上帝 

668
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,566
那么余留的是什么 

669
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,866
我们在我们的自由中 

670
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:10,799
这才是真正的基督教“诡计” 

671
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,833
我说 上帝给了我们所有的自由 

672
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,933
他说 但上帝没有 

673
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:21,133
上帝放弃了 他只是创造了世界 而后留我们独自一人 上帝抛弃了我们 

674
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:24,066
我会说 但那是自由的另一个名字 

675
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,499
你应该换个角度 

676
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:36,366
或者用另一种方式说 我在这里 我是基于我所爱的切斯特顿开始的一些非常好的神学阅读 

677
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:44,399
在其他宗教中 简单来说 人 

678
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:47,199
人是从上帝那里堕落而来到尘世 

679
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:54,199
所以（它们的）想法是 让我们通过一些愚蠢的精神练习--无论是什么--爬回去 

680
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,233
比如 让我们摆脱我们的罪恶本性 回到上帝那里 

681
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,366
但基督教的解决方案是一个完全不同的选择 举例来说

682
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:10,266
假设你作为一个普通信徒 发现自己被上帝完全抛弃了

683
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:24,466
那么出路是什么 不是说 让我通过做一些好事或自我惩罚来变得纯洁 不 就是在那个时候 当我被上帝完全抛弃时

684
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:33,899
我（才开始能够）认同基督 他发现自己处于完全相同的位置 带着那句著名的话 父亲 父亲 你为什么离弃我 

685
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:54,433
所以这是一个奇妙的洞察 你应该以一种非常黑格尔的方式看到 我们如何克服与上帝的分离 不是通过重新加入上帝 而是意识到这种分离也是上帝自身的分离 

686
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:59,133
在那一点上 我们是神圣的 

687
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:08,899
因为再次 神性的终极时刻是那一刻 正如吉尔伯特·基思·切斯特顿所说 上帝自己变成无神论者的那一刻 

688
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:17,899
记住 在十字架上 当基督说 父亲 父亲 你为什么离弃我时 他短暂成为一个非信徒 

689
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,900
这是一个疯狂的时刻 

690
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,966
你在其他宗教中找不到这个 

691
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,933
在其他宗教中 你确实找到了背弃上帝的人 

692
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,433
但你在（那个宗教里能）找到上帝背弃了自己呢？

693
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:36,066
而且 基督教的解决方案不是 你受苦 你低下 但别担心 （而后会）有好消息 

694
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:38,566
不 没有好消息 

695
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,233
好消息只是对坏消息的不同视角转变 

696
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,399
我们仍然被上帝抛弃 

697
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:47,899
上帝不会来拯救我们 

698
00:11:48,366 --> 00:12:01,899
正如那些不愚蠢的保守神学家所知 比如我最喜欢的法国保守天主教徒保罗·克洛岱尔 他非常漂亮地说 基督教的终极秘密不是信任上帝 

699
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,099
（像是说）情况可能看起来糟糕 但上帝会帮助你 

700
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:06,933
不 正好相反 

701
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:08,266
上帝需要我们的帮助 

702
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,466
只有我们能拯救上帝 

703
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:20,733
换句话说 神性的 还有一些神智的推测--我就不深究了 我们没有时间浪费在这里--

704
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:32,499
它们以一种奇妙的方式发展这一点 他们声称转世的秘密不是上帝做了一些英雄般的事来赎回我们 

705
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:38,333
上帝 没有道成肉身的上帝不是完全的上帝 

706
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,066
上帝通过化身成人来成为完全的上帝 

707
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:49,433
这是我最喜欢的一个解决方案之一 除了黑格尔 德国唯心主义者谢林 

708
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,733
--海德格尔后来在他的基础上发展了这一点--这两篇文本 尤其是《自由论》 

709
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,733
谢林关于人类自由本质的文本 

710
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:03,799
以及后来关于世界时代的《世界纪》片段 

711
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:18,000
他展开了这个观点 上帝如何产生逻各斯 生下了逻各斯的儿子--谢林在字面意思上这样说--为了把自己从自己的疯狂中拯救出来 

712
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:27,966
如果我可以愤世嫉俗一点 你知道 精神病医生说 如果你陷入精神病 你需要创造性治疗 你知道 通过工作 

713
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,300
嗯 那就是上帝所做的 

714
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,966
还有一些 如果你认为我在吹牛 

715
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:40,166
一些非常聪明的新教神学家得出了相同的结论 

716
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:50,799
比如 我的一位挪威朋友给了我一个参考 并且因为这不是一本众所周知的书 只在挪威出名 他给我翻译了一些部分 

717
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:58,199
那个人的名字是彼得·韦塞尔·扎克韦 一本关于新教上帝的书 

718
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:01,633
这是对约伯记的阅读 

719
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,700
你知道他的解读是什么吗？

720
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:20,366
约伯在遇到上帝时发现了什么 当他意识到上帝正在做一些非常奇怪的事情 正在无缘无故地惩罚他？

721
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:32,533
这里是扎普费尔的一段引用 约伯发现自己面对一个世界统治者 上帝 具有怪诞的原始性 

722
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:41,366
一个宇宙洞穴居住者 一个吹牛和大放厥词的人 几乎在他对精神文化的完全无知中令人愉快 

723
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:48,433
对约伯来说新的不是上帝在量化术语中的伟大 那我们事先完全知道 

724
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:52,599
新的是上帝在定性上的卑微 

725
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,666
我认为这也是新教大主题——预定论的深刻洞察 

726
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:06,599
它的意思是 上帝只是和我们玩一个残酷的游戏 他不在乎 

727
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:15,533
上帝预先决定了 你得救了 你迷失了 完全不考虑我们在做什么 

728
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:17,499
我认为这是正确的路线 

729
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:34,199
我认为 正如聪明的新教徒所看到的 那种天主教的方式 将我们的救赎与我们的善行联系起来 立即引入了一种可操作的因素 一种金融交易 

730
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:41,166
我看到那个孩子正在溺水 我应该救还是不救 好吧 我可能会因此得救 所以去他的 为什么不做呢？

731
00:15:42,466 --> 00:15:47,633
这使我们的善行成为一种几乎可以说是对未来的金融投资的一部分 

732
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:57,266
但正如路德非常聪明地指出的 如果存在预定论 那么它的解决方案就是纯粹的善行 

733
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:10,466
因为你看到一个孩子在溺水 抱歉用这个可怜的例子 你非常清楚 无论你救不救那个孩子 都对你的救赎没有任何帮助 

734
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:21,300
所以 唯有善良才促使你去做这件事 

735
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:30,766
所以让我们继续这里 

736
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:37,833
在这种情况下 即解决办法不是神与人的某种重新统一 

737
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:47,766
我们通过一个简单的认识来克服我们对上帝的异化 那就是上帝已经从自己那里异化 自我放弃了 

738
00:16:49,200 --> 00:17:02,566
我喜欢在这里应用黑格尔对古希腊雕像的精彩解读 那对我们是不可理解的 比如斯芬克斯意味着什么？

739
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:04,499
你知道黑格尔的公式是什么 

740
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:11,666
古希腊人的秘密 对我们来说是秘密 对古希腊人自己也是秘密 

741
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:26,399
黑格尔的神学正是这个 神性的秘密也是对神性本身的秘密 

742
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,333
这是古老的神秘主题 

743
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,966
黑格尔也谈到了这一点 

744
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:40,366
你在迈斯特·埃克哈特和所有其他人那里找到它 把历史带入上帝自身 

745
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:49,233
我们在地球上发生的事 我们的神学活动 某种方式决定了上帝自身的命运 

746
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,400
（所以）情况正好相反 

747
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,566
不是上帝决定（一切） 不 

748
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,033
在我们的斗争中 我们为上帝自身的命运而战 

749
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:07,633
那么如何提出--现在可能会有点困难--适当的神学观点 

750
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,033
我认为我在我的课堂上已经对此进行了一些即兴发挥 

751
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:19,766
这是否意味着新教简单地废除了我们的自由？

752
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:26,099
每个了解路德的人 我没有时间深入讨论 但我已经写好了 

753
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:37,400
对马丁·路德与托马斯·闵采尔之间的紧张关系进行了详细分析 后者是德国农民起义的伟大神学家 

754
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,033
也许这会让你感到惊讶 但我几乎更支持早期的路德 

755
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:50,900
他是正确的 闵采尔在批评路德支持权威们 等等 是正确的 

756
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:55,999
但我认为闵采尔 已经太接近了

757
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:02,066
接近于这种倾向于极权主义的扭曲工具化立场 

758
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:10,266
因为路德是正确的 这是他最伟大的神学洞察 坚持神的不可入性 

759
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,133
这写成唯物主义方式 并不意味着上帝知道他在做什么 我们只是无法渗透（了解）它 

760
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,566
这意味着引用自Sapwe 上帝是疯狂的 无法了解 

761
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:27,599
所以路德正是警告我们所谓的今天的原教旨主义 

762
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,566
任何一个历史上的施动者的立场--喔 我的天 这里发生了什么？

763
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:40,399
我有点迷信了 昨天这里还只有一只 好吧 至少它们不是黑猫 我们会幸存的 

764
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,899
这就是Mao派运动 一分为二--

765
00:19:45,133 --> 00:20:00,133
好吧 抱歉 让我们继续 路德很接近这一点了 这是路德直接禁止的 即将自己的政治运动视为神圣意志的直接工具 

766
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:10,066
他坚持这种彻底的不可渗透性 即 存在着宿命 但我们永远不知道宿命是什么 

767
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:17,533
就像我们的生活是被提前决定的 但我们永远无法知道 

768
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:31,166
所以绝对禁止声称“我是神圣意志的工具” 就像斯大林主义共产主义者以不同方式阐述 “历史的必然性通过我向共产主义前进” 

769
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,833
不 我们不能这样做 

770
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,666
我认为这是真正的自由 

771
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:43,533
这种思想 我的生活是预定的 但我不知道是什么 

772
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:47,966
需要通过可怕的斗争去做出正确的决定 

773
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,633
因为你知道 这里常识不起作用 

774
00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:56,099
因为常识会告诉我们 你为什么担心？

775
00:20:56,466 --> 00:21:02,733
如果有宿命论 坐下来手淫 看色情电影 没关系 

776
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:13,566
不 这个想法也是--这就是为什么它不起作用 它解释了 我们都知道 我甚至在重复自己 我想几年前 我已经在这里讲过了 很抱歉--

777
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:30,566
因为这也解释了宿命论和自由的这个悖论 解释了这个马克斯·韦伯的经典文章的最大谜团 为什么新教 这个基于宿命论的宗教

778
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:47,766
成为了资本主义的宗教背景 至少最初如此 （因为）它正是最活跃的社会系统 一个时刻都要求你活跃如狂的系统 

779
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:56,466
再说 如果一切都是预定的 那逻辑上不是应该说 去他的 我躺下来 等上帝来的时候叫醒我 先让我一个人呆着吧 

780
00:21:58,033 --> 00:22:09,966
韦伯清楚地看到了这一点 路德也是 正因为你知道你的命运是预定的 但不知道你的命运是什么 所以着推动你进行不停的活动

781
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:19,166
我认为这个决定 这个困难的决定去发现是否存在宿命 （是否存在）信仰的必然性 

782
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:30,466
信仰是什么 是更接近真正的自由--我用过一个隐喻 如果你是我之前课堂的学生的话 很抱歉--

783
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:40,800
那种简单的自由 我去糕点店 他们有草莓蛋糕、巧克力蛋糕、香草蛋糕 或者我将选择哪一个 你知道 这种简单的选择自由 

784
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:47,666
不 真正的自由是这样的 即使现在你会说我疯了 

785
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,066
但让我给你一个我在之前课上举出过的例子

786
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:54,433
想想爱情 对于爱情中另一客体的选择 

787
00:22:55,266 --> 00:22:58,433
它必须是自由的 否则 它就不是爱 对吗？

788
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:03,833
但它从未作为一个所谓的自由选择而发生在你身上 

789
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:09,033
如果你说 哦 现在我将爱上那个女士/男士 那是假的 

790
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:21,766
这是一个自由的决定 但正如谢林所说 一个超越的 先于时间的自由决定 而你恰恰以其相反的、作为你的命运的方式体验它 

791
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:27,166
你体验爱情如同 我的天 我无法逃脱 我被困在其中 

792
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,433
那才是真正的自由 

793
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:29,766
那是根本的自由 

794
00:23:30,133 --> 00:23:32,833
现在你会说 这是感性的猜测 

795
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,300
不 我会用我课上的另一个例子 

796
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:40,333
难道这和艰难的政治决定不一样吗？

797
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:46,599
不是那些简单的决定 投票给马克龙 还是投票给勒庞 我不在乎 

798
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:50,199
但让我们来一个可怜的例子 

799
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:57,233
发生了战争 我的国家被攻击 我必须决定我是否冒着生命危险去做 

800
00:23:58,133 --> 00:24:00,266
这是我做出的自由决定 

801
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:07,433
但如果你做出了艰难的决定 你将要战斗 你不会将其视为一种选择 

802
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:13,000
你感受到的是 我真希望不去做 但这是我的责任 我不得不做 

803
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:14,533
我必须去做 

804
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:22,999
我认为这提供了这种奇妙的辩证法 据我所知 只有黑格尔在哲学中清晰地描述过 

805
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:33,466
只有黑格尔清晰地描述了如果我们以唯物主义方式去解读新教的宿命论 

806
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:40,866
它要比简单的观念——有宿命论 一切都是决定的——更具有悖论性 

807
00:24:41,633 --> 00:24:48,666
意味着我们有一个命运 但我们反过来创造这个命运 

808
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:56,233
比如 我自由地决定了某件事情 一旦我做出决定 从事后来看 它就是必然的 

809
00:24:56,933 --> 00:25:02,433
如果我做了正确的事情 我会感受到 我的天啊 我别无选择 我必须这么做 

810
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,633
这就是自由 

811
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:07,033
所以 这是我对新教的第一个观点 

812
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:14,399
这意味着 你不仅自由 而且你比你所认为的更自由 

813
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,000
你甚至对你的命运、你的必然性负责 

814
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:34,000
再次 正如我已经在我的课上解释的 精神分析学在这里与新教相遇 

815
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:39,933
因为在精神分析中 一个明显的结论是 某种形式的宿命论 

816
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:50,633
你知道 就像 我认为我是一个自由的存在 但并不 一切都被我的过去的创伤--无论什么--预先决定了 所以我发现我并不自由 

817
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:56,566
这是半个世纪前法国结构主义盛行时的流行教训 

818
00:25:57,033 --> 00:26:01,366
这就是精神分析学被理解的方式 结构主义精神分析学 

819
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:09,199
你认为你是一个自由的主体 不 你只是一个傀儡 大他者、象征秩序在操控你 等等 

820
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:25,666
但是看 拉康在这里跟随弗洛伊德 是的 你是被过度决定的 但你不能使用这种过度决定或心理必然性作为借口 

821
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:30,499
你知道 像是 用粗俗的话说 很抱歉 

822
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:35,566
我强奸了一个孩子 然后我对法官说 对不起 伙计们 我能怎么办？

823
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:38,666
我是被我的无意识复杂性过度决定的 

824
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:44,233
不 虽然你是被命运预定的 但你甚至对那也负有责任 

825
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:47,933
你负有更根本的责任 

826
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:57,999
我现在不能深入讨论 我已经在我的课上讨论了同样的问题也适用于康德伦理学 这就是为什么它是一件伟大的事情 

827
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:01,699
康德说 先做康德 然后做灵魂 

828
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,633
你能做到 因为你必须做到 

829
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:08,166
你没有借口不去履行你的职责 

830
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,266
如果那是你的职责 你必须去做 

831
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:15,166
但是康德--这并不经常被注意到 甚至更进一步--

832
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:22,499
他还暗示 即使“履行你的职责”也不能成为履行你职责的借口 

833
00:27:23,033 --> 00:27:24,599
比如克里斯 我恨你 让我做一些事 

834
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,100
我必须做一些事 那是我的职责去伤害你 

835
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:33,166
（但其实）我没有权力告诉你 对不起 伙计 但这是我的职责 

836
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:36,199
不 我没有权力将其外化 

837
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,033
我不仅仅是负有履行我的职责的责任 

838
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:45,633
我还必须在主观上完全认同我的职责 以理解我的职责是什么

839
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,766
这就是为什么 顺便说一句 我在我的课上简要提到了这一点 现在我将停止抄袭我自己 

840
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:54,199
别担心 我不会重复我的课程 

841
00:27:54,933 --> 00:28:00,533
这就是为什么我认为 尽管我佩服她 在她那本其他方面精彩的《耶路撒冷的艾希曼》中 

842
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:05,700
如果我记得正确的话 汉娜·阿伦特错了

843
00:28:06,466 --> 00:28:11,333
当她认真对待艾希曼的说法 他只是一个标准的康德主义者

844
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:19,366
他为他自己履行了职责 职责体现在元首的命令中 所以对不起 我在履行我的职责 

845
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,100
不 艾希曼确切地做了错误的事情 

846
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:30,966
他不是一个康德主义者 因为他做了康德严格禁止的事情 

847
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:37,933
他把职责用作借口 对不起 我杀害了数百万犹太人 我能怎么办 那是我的职责 

848
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:45,099
不 你不能将你的职责视为某种你只需遵循的客观决定 

849
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,666
你对你的职责负有根本的责任 

850
00:28:50,933 --> 00:28:53,966
现在我要让问题复杂化 

851
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,933
现在结束自我推销 

852
00:28:58,033 --> 00:28:59,066
你会得到一些新内容 

853
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:06,199
这个解决方案 这种必要性与自由的辩证相互联系 在这里 是的 存在必要性 

854
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:10,599
但这种必要性 在更深层次上 是偶然的 

855
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,533
就像 你以一种偶然的方式做某事 

856
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,933
一旦你做了 它事后成为你的命运 

857
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:21,433
这个解决方案只在一个条件下有效 

858
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:32,233
（即）主体、信徒、施动者 完全受到他或她有限主观性视野的约束（的时候） 

859
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:41,866
新教禁止的是这种想法 即作为一个信徒 我可以 可以说 

860
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:52,833
站在自己之外、之上的位置 将自己视为浩瀚现实中的一个微小粒子 

861
00:29:53,533 --> 00:30:00,499
既然我已经提到了Mao 我想在哲学层面上批评他一下

862
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:07,799
顺便说一下 因为我像这样的一些观点 阿伦·巴迪欧甚至现在对我很生气 你知道的 

863
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:21,066
我认为Mao在他部署他的“奥林匹克视野”时犯了错误 将人类的经历简化为一个微不足道的宇宙细节 

864
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:30,133
你知道 在他那句著名的话中 他说 “我们不怕原子战争” 好吧 原则上我同意 

865
00:30:30,733 --> 00:30:40,566
但Mao接着说了这样一句话 引用Mao的话 美国用它那一小堆原子弹是无法消灭东印度民族的 

866
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:56,466
即使美国的原子弹如此强大 当它们投放在东印度时 能够穿透地球 甚至将地球炸毁 这对整个宇宙来说几乎意味着什么都没有 

867
00:30:56,833 --> 00:31:01,966
尽管这对太阳系来说可能是一个重大事件 

868
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,366
你知道 这有点奇怪的借口 

869
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:11,599
好吧 美国人可以摧毁我们 但从宇宙的角度来看 这意味着什么呢？

870
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:23,966
我认为这个论点 Mao的论点 只有在一种伪康德方式下才行得通 

871
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:34,533
问题是 Mao是从哪个主观位置发表这个声明的？

872
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:46,266
他行为就像他是从一个完全外部的、纯粹神圣的位置发言 从那里你可以客观地看到人类的现实 然后你可以说 

873
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:53,633
好吧 我们的地球被炸毁了 去他的 一个小星球上的小光点 谁在乎？

874
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:00,166
但这里我没有时间发展它 但这是美妙的神学话题 

875
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:12,533
聪明的新教有一个奇妙的视角 那就是偶然性和必然性之间的连接再次被提及 

876
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,233
一方面 是的 我们是浩瀚宇宙中的微小部分 

877
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:36,999
新教不是种族中心主义的 这就是为什么新教在某种程度上代表了现代性 正是现代科学的宗教背景 正是引入了现实的客观观点 

878
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:43,500
你知道 在新教之前 中世纪的世界是以地球为中心 

879
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:56,166
尽管我们人类不是宇宙的中心 上帝是 但尽管如此 我们是被创造的宇宙的最高点 一切都围绕我们转动 

880
00:32:57,033 --> 00:33:05,299
所以 新教的统一之处 我现在没有时间去发展它 只是为了给出一个想法 我认为这是一些奇妙的东西 

881
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,233
同时 这种极其残酷的观点 

882
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,266
从一个非人类的视角看 我们什么都不是 

883
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:16,766
地球上的一个微小物种 不重要 

884
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:26,933
但尽管如此 由于我们在道德实践中永远无法真正假设这种观点 即这种外部视角

885
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:41,700
（那么）我们必须行动 就好像不管何时--康德把这个说得很好--尽管客观科学告诉我们 去他的 我们是宇宙中的一粒尘埃 

886
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:55,666
尽管如此 在一场巨大的道德斗争中 决定的不仅仅是我们的命运 可以说--康德说的很好--整个宇宙都是作为我们这场斗争的背景而创造的 

887
00:33:56,133 --> 00:34:00,899
你知道 我喜欢这种极端的种族中心主义的统一 

888
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:09,266
世界被创造出来 以便我们可以进行这场战斗 以及这种极端的外部观点 

889
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:17,733
因为这在某种程度上是 当你见证一个大的变革 革命或任何事情 

890
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:25,733
甚至在大屠杀中 我认为智慧的论点 即使是哈贝马斯也提出了 他试图成为一个理性主义者 

891
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:39,733
但哈贝马斯 我不同意他的观点 曾经提出了一个很好的观点 他说大屠杀 我还会补充说 像刚果发生的以及其他可怕的事情等等 

892
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:49,933
发生了如此可怕的事情 当你将其简化为一个简单的人类事件时 你以某种方式减少了其恐怖性 

893
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:59,400
在阶级斗争中出了问题 无论什么 说大屠杀只是阶级斗争和努力的一个小分支是可怕的 

894
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:15,100
哈贝马斯非常智慧地说 神学维度在这里只是一种方式 一种特定的方式 来标志发生了如此可怕的事情 它不适合我们的宇宙 

895
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:23,166
我们不能 我会这样说 我们不能简单地将其重新归类为另一个历史事件 

896
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:42,333
这就是为什么 不知道这是不是一本关于大屠杀的书的标题 你可能纠正我 也许你更了解 《黑太阳》 太阳本身变黑了 你知道 就像有人很好地说 当像大屠杀这样的事情发生时 世界还能继续存在 这是一种耻辱 

897
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:48,799
如果世界上有基本的道德 出于羞耻 世界应该崩溃 

898
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:58,699
所以这就是 现在来了 我感谢你的耐心 也许是我第一个更有趣的观点 

899
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:06,166
这是新教的悖论的一部分 彻底的人类中心主义 

900
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:10,766
但同时让我们用非人类的眼光看待自己 

901
00:36:11,933 --> 00:36:22,899
在这里 我认为 但我在解读他们 我指的是组合论、新唯物主义、面向对象的本体论 它们可以和我的立场结合起来 

902
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:32,699
因为什么是真正的--让我们天真地称之为--震撼性的伦理伟大 尽管我以一种少见的方式解读它 

903
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:46,866
我将在这里专注于所谓的新唯物主义 简·班尼特 即 我们应该将我们的生活视为自然中各种施动者之间的相互作用

904
00:36:48,066 --> 00:37:03,000
她称它们为施动者 我认为是跟随拉图尔的 它们相互作用 我们应该通过一个非人类的视角来看待它 将其视为一个生活的相互作用过程

905
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,533
我们只是其中的一个元素 

906
00:37:06,233 --> 00:37:15,099
在她的书中 我认为是《活力物质》 简·班尼特提供了一个垃圾场的美丽描述 

907
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:19,966
她说 我们认为垃圾场里什么都没有 那里有一堆垃圾在腐烂 

908
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,200
但她说 如果我们用一个想象中的非人类眼光看待它 作为一个生活过程怎么样？

909
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:43,833
我们有一个复杂的腐烂垃圾、蠕虫、昆虫、被遗弃的机器、化学毒素的相互作用 每个地方、每个元素、施动者 都扮演着它自己从不完全被动的角色 

910
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:55,666
我认为 所谓的新唯物主义或面向对象的本体论在其最激进的形式上 提供了这种非人类视角 

911
00:37:57,333 --> 00:38:03,099
再次 我认为这种方法中有一个真正的理论和伦理政治洞察 

912
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:21,899
因此 社会成为一个社会现象 但社会性的界限被扩展到包括所有参与相关集合的物质实体 

913
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:34,333
比如 一个公共生态是一群实体 一些是人类 大多数不是 他们受到的伤害被定义为行动能力下降 

914
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:50,966
当然 伦理含义是 我们必须承认在更大的组合体中的纠缠--比如我们不是--自然不是为我们服务的 我们只是地球上众多施动者中的一个 

915
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,966
这是我的第一个小小的分歧 

916
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:04,600
我认为不知不觉中 她的描述也仍然是彻底的人类中心主义 

917
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:23,799
知道是什么意思吗 越是试图在内容层面上保持客观 就越是将我们、人类物种进行特殊化 即作为唯一能够接触到这种普遍性的物种 

918
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:40,166
这是我对那些所谓的深层生态学家的问题 他们声称动物--甚至我的一个斯堪的纳维亚朋友写了一本书 他声称甚至美丽的峡谷、自然的一部分 

919
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:54,566
应该被视为拥有人权的主体施动者 就像有一个美丽的有机整体 在他给出的冰岛的一个美丽岩石形成的例子中 

920
00:39:54,633 --> 00:40:06,533
他说 不仅如现在流行的说法 即动物应该拥有它们的权利 不仅是人类权利 （而且）森林应该拥有他们的权利 甚至河流也应该有它们的权利 

921
00:40:06,566 --> 00:40:07,533
但你知道问题在哪里吗？

922
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:09,166
它们不知道 

923
00:40:09,633 --> 00:40:18,366
当我们想要充当深层生态学家时 我们自然而然地就会采取你能想象到的最傲慢、以人类为中心的立场 

924
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:25,066
因为你自动假设我们--是的 我们表面上贬低了自己--

925
00:40:25,766 --> 00:40:33,166
但我们人类是唯一了解、拥有通往这个普遍维度通道的施动者 

926
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,266
我的意思是 树木不知道它们的权利 

927
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:43,133
当一条河流在破坏树木时 它不知道它正在侵犯其他人的权利 

928
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:58,033
你知道 这和某种类型的多元文化主义的虚假性是一样的 我们声称我们不是唯一拥有权利的人 

929
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,833
其他文化也有权利 

930
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:06,499
但我们越是自贬我们的西方文明--我们只是其中之一--

931
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:17,900
我们越是行为得就像我们是唯一能够接触到普遍维度并且可以说出其他人的权利是什么的人 

932
00:41:18,866 --> 00:41:22,599
我在美国的辩论中经常感到这一点 

933
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:29,966
它是典型的傲慢的 政治上正确的态度 一旦我见证了这样的情况 

934
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:35,766
一个白人自由主义者 当然他们总是白人 为黑人权利辩护 

935
00:41:36,033 --> 00:41:38,199
这很完美 我彻底支持他们 

936
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,733
但问题是 而后 一些黑人不同意他 

937
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:49,266
基本上他（白人）就开始对他们大喊 就像 你不知道你的权利是什么 我会告诉你 

938
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:57,433
这是隐藏的傲慢 我认为这与那些同情难民的人有同样的问题 

939
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,700
这就是为什么我对这种永恒的欧洲人自我羞辱感到怀疑

940
00:42:03,566 --> 00:42:06,599
这是我所说的白人负担的逆转 

941
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,866
你知道 白人负担是一个古老的英语表达 殖民主义者 我们白人被自然、上帝、或任何人赋予任务 我们的负担是引领其他国家走向文明生活 等等 

942
00:42:10,133 --> 00:42:23,999
现在我们有了白人负担的相反版本 我认为这也是一种精致的种族主义 

943
00:42:24,733 --> 00:42:31,299
每当第三世界国家发生一些事情 比如卢旺达的屠杀 （那么）它必须是殖民主义的影响 

944
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:40,566
我有一个来自尼日利亚的非洲朋友 他明白了这一点 他爆发了 

945
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:46,333
他说 你们这些欧洲人真是种族主义者 

946
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,833
你们甚至不允许我们真正地邪恶 

947
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,366
你们把我们当成如此天真的孩子 你们认为 每当我们做错事 它一定是你们的过错 

948
00:42:54,066 --> 00:43:00,733
这是白人负担的新版本 

949
00:43:00,766 --> 00:43:02,699
这是白人负担的新版本 

950
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,733
让我们环顾四周 

951
00:43:04,133 --> 00:43:05,966
柬埔寨发生了大屠杀 

952
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:08,233
哦 它一定是殖民主义的影响 

953
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,400
好吧 我们继续 

954
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:16,299
现在事情会变得更加糟糕 

955
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:23,233
我认为简·班尼特 如果她在这里 她会爆炸的 

956
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:37,000
我有关组合论的最后一个例子不是一种廉价的挑衅 请不要误解我 将组合理论解读为原始法西斯主义 恰恰相反 

957
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:50,800
我甚至很想--但我害怕我会受到更多的攻击--写一篇简短的文章来描述奥斯威辛作为一个组合体以让我们忘记人类的苦难 

958
00:43:51,266 --> 00:44:04,433
让我们将奥斯威辛视为人类、受害者、蠕虫、火焰等的合作 一种物质相互作用的客观过程 

959
00:44:09,466 --> 00:44:21,466
我们可以说不仅是纳粹是施动者 犯人是施动者 吃尸体的蠕虫（如果有的话 如果它们没有被完全烧毁）是施动者 等等 

960
00:44:22,166 --> 00:44:22,766
我们可以这样做 

961
00:44:23,533 --> 00:44:28,366
但现在另一个哲学观点 我很遗憾我没有时间来展开它 

962
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:43,433
我们在这里得到的 现在我将转向吉尔·德勒兹 我对他持批评态度 但他是一个天才 拥有独到的见解 德勒兹说他的思想试图构建--

963
00:44:43,733 --> 00:44:51,466
引用 一种视角 将现实视为在人类之前或之后的样子 

964
00:44:52,466 --> 00:44:57,299
一种从人类坐标中释放出来的感知 

965
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:05,266
他说我们应该将现实视为引用“人类之前的世界的五彩缤纷的混沌” 

966
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:12,033
现在我声称这并不意味着宇宙学的推测 比如大爆炸看起来如何 

967
00:45:12,633 --> 00:45:19,199
它意味着拿一个现象 比如奥斯威辛 从人类关切之外来看待它 

968
00:45:19,933 --> 00:45:25,666
当然 这是一个极端亵渎的视角 

969
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,466
因为在某种意义上 你做不到这一点 

970
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:34,533
这里我来到我的下一个观点 我将非常简短 我真的不想花太多时间 

971
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:46,899
我认为 在这里德勒兹引入了康德之间的区分 他在某些时候明确使用了这些术语 

972
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:57,366
区分了对我们而言的现象实在和自身之中的实在 以名义上、独立于我们的意义上 

973
00:45:57,966 --> 00:46:12,633
而不是以一种天真的方式认为 自身之中的实在就是外在于我们视角之外的实际存在的现实 而是将其视为--我将这样表达--一个不可能的现象

974
00:46:13,033 --> 00:46:17,099
我给你们的奥斯威辛的视角的问题 

975
00:46:18,133 --> 00:46:23,399
不是说 你不能声称这是虚张声势 那是奥斯威辛真实的样子 

976
00:46:24,033 --> 00:46:28,266
不 它仍然是我们的视角 但它是不可能的视角 

977
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,566
这太戏剧化了 

978
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:34,566
作为道德的人 我们无法承受以那种方式看待现实 

979
00:46:34,966 --> 00:46:44,399
囚犯们 被烧毁的人仅仅被简化为一个行动体 与蠕虫等一道 

980
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:57,833
所以我的观点是 这里的克洛德·兰茨曼 我经常不同意他 

981
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:06,800
我认为他是在惊吓你们 我发现他在道德上非常可疑 但在某些时刻他是正确的 

982
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:15,533
他写道如果他发现 比方说一些纳粹这样做了 

983
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:24,466
如果他发现了胶卷 我的意思是电影 有直接拍摄的奥斯威辛最残酷的时刻 

984
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:32,599
你看到肉体被毒气杀死 以及在恐慌中的母亲如何爬到她的孩子上面 

985
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:39,733
（踩着孩子）以使自己站得更高 （离毒气远一点）以求生 你知道 最残酷的时刻 

986
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,266
他说 我会立即烧掉它 

987
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,000
他是对的 

988
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:45,566
你在这里看到得太多了 

989
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:47,066
但这里的要点是 

990
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:50,733
这不是说你看到了客观现实的方式 

991
00:47:51,300 --> 00:48:00,833
你看到了一个现象 它仍然是一个现象 但是这是一个无法被整合进我们的现实的现象 

992
00:48:00,933 --> 00:48:02,266
好的 这是哲学 

993
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:07,500
现在我来到最后一点 这可能对你们中的一些人来说是有问题的 

994
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:17,266
在某个时候 我甚至因为在伦敦展示这一部分而受到批评 一位老太太走近我 基本上是要求我给出一个触发警告

995
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,900
她说 这太残酷了 你不应该向我们展示它 

996
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,733
但我不相信触发警告的逻辑 你知道 

997
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:31,599
我认为学术不是一个安全的地方--在那里你逃避艰苦的生活--

998
00:48:32,633 --> 00:48:36,499
相反 学术应该让你面对残酷 你知道 

999
00:48:36,933 --> 00:48:38,166
好的 所以让我们继续 

1000
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:49,866
在这个混乱的世界里 一切都取决于我们作为道德主体 但同时 你看到我所说的悖论 

1001
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:54,100
例如 看看美国的奴隶制 

1002
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,900
你可以提供一个客观的历史 

1003
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:04,333
这是非洲黑人部落合作出售奴隶 等等 

1004
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,566
你做一个客观的历史 

1005
00:49:07,933 --> 00:49:11,366
你可以这样做 但这是一种绝对的亵渎 

1006
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:17,633
以这种中立的方式做 客观性变成了完全的亵渎 

1007
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:21,366
以客观的方式报告它是一种亵渎 

1008
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:34,199
所以再次 如果我们试图将这两个方面结合起来 即这种无根的客观性 同时又完全的道德参与 我们会得到什么样的道德呢

1009
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:36,766
现在来到我的最后一个例子 

1010
00:49:37,466 --> 00:49:47,366
全球化的好方面之一 我认为 我真的喜欢它 我不反对全球化 你知道为什么吗 因为它是真正的多元文化 

1011
00:49:48,200 --> 00:50:04,966
我的意思是 不是以这种通常的左翼自由主义意义上的多元文化 而是意味着不仅仅是美国文化 也许法国、英国 小国家也有机会 

1012
00:50:04,966 --> 00:50:18,233
你还记得多年前有一段时间的韩国、Taiwanese电影 甚至一段时间的罗马尼亚电影 他们非常好 有奇妙的讽刺意味等等 

1013
00:50:18,233 --> 00:50:23,566
永远不要忘记 这也是全球化的好效果 

1014
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:30,100
不是简单地说 我们都将吃汉堡包和观看好莱坞大片 

1015
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:37,500
如果有什么 我的预测是全球化的一个可能结果将是好莱坞会开始失去地位 

1016
00:50:37,633 --> 00:50:51,399
我的意思是 谁还想看他们那些愚蠢的大片 他们甚至不能制作新的公式 他们所能做的就是无休止地翻拍旧电影 然后将它们结合起来 

1017
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:56,266
现在你有蝙蝠侠与超人等等 真是绝望 

1018
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:03,066
所以我想说的是 我喜欢阅读好的侦探小说 

1019
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:07,366
而且我们现在有一个新的浪潮 这是我喜欢的 我发现了 

1020
00:51:08,033 --> 00:51:21,799
不再是那些 几个特权地点 你知道 就像英格兰的经典侦探小说 美国洛杉矶地区的硬汉侦探小说 或许还有法国的一些作品等等 

1021
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,433
现在侦探小说可以发生在任何地方 任何时间 

1022
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,866
你知道吗 你已经有小说发生在古埃及？

1023
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,733
一位牧师是某个愚蠢法老宫廷的侦探 

1024
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:41,699
你有侦探小说 斯蒂芬·塞勒写的 发生在古罗马 

1025
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:46,233
一位与朱利叶斯·凯撒熟识的人做了这项工作 

1026
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:55,266
你有关于亚历山大大帝的系列 等等任何地方 中世纪 翁贝托·艾柯首先在中世纪开始了 

1027
00:51:55,833 --> 00:52:00,999
现在有些小说发生在西藏、俄罗斯 我最喜欢的是那些发生在极端环境中的小说 

1028
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:15,466
比如现在有一整个侦探小说的子类别 发生在我们至少在欧洲视为极端时刻的两个时期 

1029
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:20,333
德国战争的最后几年和最严酷的斯大林主义 

1030
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:36,399
比如 昨天 我刚读完一本叫做吉姆·麦克德莫特的《佩纳蒙德》 讲的是冯·布劳恩建造火箭的地方 1944年佩纳蒙德发生了一场谋杀 一名工程师被枪杀 

1031
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:43,200
我喜欢--或者你有斯大林主义--莫斯科市中心发现了35具尸体 

1032
00:52:43,666 --> 00:52:52,666
一名正直的警察试图解决危机 但受害者是外国人 克格勃介入 一团糟 好吧 为了不迷失方向

1033
00:52:52,700 --> 00:53:06,500
沿着这些线索好吧 我会告诉你一个梦想 因为没人会想做这个 我不在乎你知不知道 我的简单梦想是写一部小说 但是诚实的 不是讽刺的 

1034
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:18,166
发生在奥斯威辛 囚犯之一被发现被勒死 他们都在死亡边缘 但其中一个人试图把它当作谋杀案来解决 

1035
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,100
然后我想做一个悲剧性的乐观结局 

1036
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:33,999
他解决了谋杀案 但然后他们都走向一个众所周知的地方 有一个大型的焚烧设备等等 

1037
00:53:34,566 --> 00:53:47,133
沿着这些线索 我喜欢新的 这是老掉牙的新闻 甚至是瑞典 甚至是冰岛 挪威 乔·内斯博 

1038
00:53:47,666 --> 00:53:50,933
我最喜欢的现在是 来自丹麦的惊悚小说 

1039
00:53:52,033 --> 00:54:00,533
不仅是小说 还有电视剧 《杀戮》和一系列被改编成电影的小说 一个三部曲 

1040
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,166
我想给你们放一个短片段 来自其中之一 

1041
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:13,833
原标题是《闪光和邮件--信息在瓶子里》--在英语中我不知道为什么 但这是一个很好的标题变化--

1042
00:54:14,533 --> 00:54:17,466
它被改成了《命运的阴谋》 

1043
00:54:17,933 --> 00:54:29,966
顺便说一下 我很想写一篇关于逻辑的文章 你知道 现在他们不再这样做了 但在50年代和60年代 甚至在一些国家晚些时候 他们总是--

1044
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:36,366
当他们为另一个国家配音一部电影时--他们总是在改变标题 

1045
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,033
例如 这很有趣 希区柯克的《西北偏北》 

1046
00:54:41,533 --> 00:54:48,499
在德国 它被相当合理地改名为《不可见的第三者》 等等 

1047
00:54:49,133 --> 00:54:55,966
我的第三个例子 对不起 我不能克制自己不讲糟糕的种族主义笑话 

1048
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,333
你知道 对巴西人来说 我和你谈过 

1049
00:54:59,866 --> 00:55:01,599
葡萄牙人是愚蠢的 

1050
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,966
想法是 所有聪明的葡萄牙人都去了巴西 那里留下的都是白痴 

1051
00:55:07,433 --> 00:55:10,433
所以你知道希区柯克的《精神病患者》的故事吗 

1052
00:55:11,033 --> 00:55:20,766
巴西的笑话是 《精神病患者》在葡萄牙的标题被改成了“他自己是自己的母亲” 以使其易于理解 

1053
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,766
所以沿着这些线索 这次它有效果 

1054
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:36,533
标题是《信仰的阴谋》 一部2016年的丹麦电影 再次呼吁非法活动（下盗版） 

1055
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:40,266
你可以立即从Pirate Bay或其他地方下载它 

1056
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:49,533
我不会用故事来烦你 但我会给你看 只需一分钟 请准备好 一个四五分钟的剪辑 

1057
00:55:50,633 --> 00:55:57,033
这是一个诚实警察的故事 他被描述为一个抑郁症晚期的人 总是绝望的 

1058
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:05,900
当然完全是80年代的 孩子们正在失踪 以一种奇怪的、虐待狂的方式被杀害 

1059
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:23,166
最后 侦探找到了凶手 他真的是一种理想的、帕西法尔式的雅利安人 长着蓝色的长发 一个病态的杀手 认为自己是恶魔的工具 恶魔的儿子 

1060
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:29,166
他的任务是 他说 摧毁父母的信仰 

1061
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:36,133
不仅仅是折磨孩子 而是他这样做是为了让父母在场或让父母意识到这一点 

1062
00:56:36,466 --> 00:56:44,333
所以他说他的主要任务不仅仅是折磨和杀害人 而是以这样一种方式做 以至于它摧毁了他们的信仰 

1063
00:56:45,433 --> 00:56:52,699
然后发生了一些道德上相当震撼的场景 

1064
00:56:53,266 --> 00:56:54,933
我觉得它很美 

1065
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,200
不要太惊慌 

1066
00:56:56,766 --> 00:56:58,966
如果你们中的一些人需要警告 

1067
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:04,266
可能会被震惊 因为一个孩子确实被淹死了 

1068
00:57:05,366 --> 00:57:05,766
事实并非如此 

1069
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,733
在电影的结尾 他活了下来 

1070
00:57:07,866 --> 00:57:10,133
他只是失去了知觉 所以这不会太过分 

1071
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:16,100
因为有些人在某次演讲中 当我展示这个时进行了抗议 你怎么能展示这个等等 

1072
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:17,333
不要这样 

1073
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:20,233
好的 现在让我们展示 我想我已经描述得足够多了 

1074
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,999
莫里塞特 莫斯科河 

1075
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,666
那里都是表演吗？

1076
00:57:34,633 --> 00:57:35,299
好的 停止 

1077
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:48,566
我认为即使是现在电影也失去了它的精神 因为好像在这种立场之后 你知道 上帝从外部介入 

1078
00:57:48,566 --> 00:57:51,133
但无论如何 我的观点非常简单 

1079
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:56,299
从我的基督教无神论者的立场来看 不 那个杀手是错的 

1080
00:57:56,333 --> 00:58:05,866
上帝出现了两次 当他 侦探 献出自己 说带走我 带走我 以及当那个女孩不想刺伤那个人时 

1081
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:10,066
所以这是我的疯狂立场 

1082
00:58:10,066 --> 00:58:12,966
我会尽量简短 不会太啰嗦 

1083
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:16,000
买我的下一本书 在那里你将会读到所有关于这个主题的章节 

1084
00:58:17,133 --> 00:58:21,266
它被称为《空虚的失禁》 将于10月由MIT出版社出版 

1085
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:25,666
这就是我所说的基督教无神论 

1086
00:58:28,666 --> 00:58:31,466
基督并不是一个积极的救赎者的形象 

1087
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:38,966
而只是这个冷漠的凝视 它给予你准备去做 没有任何信仰中的保证 

1088
00:58:39,566 --> 00:58:41,833
我不是以这种廉价的方式解读 

1089
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:47,999
那个家伙 侦探 认为自己是个无神论者 但实际上他是最深信不疑的人 

1090
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,066
他是 

1091
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,633
杀手是对的 （侦探是）最深信不疑的人 

1092
00:58:51,666 --> 00:58:53,033
你知道 当杀手告诉他 

1093
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,466
我从未遇到过一个像你这样有信仰的人 

1094
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:03,566
但这正是因为他不需要任何更高力量的保证 

1095
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:08,633
他只是必须在一个完全没有希望的情况下去做 

1096
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,933
不是因为他想在天堂获得自己的位置 

1097
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:14,899
而是纯粹的神圣善良 

1098
00:59:15,233 --> 00:59:17,199
你看到一个情况 你必须去做 

1099
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:20,299
不是因为你在算账 哦 如果我救了这个孩子 

1100
00:59:21,633 --> 00:59:23,633
我欺骗我的妻子的行为会被原谅 

1101
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,666
我会得到一个（天堂中的）床位 

1102
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:31,633
这与那无关 

1103
00:59:32,633 --> 00:59:40,599
那么好吧 为什么然后 现在你可以问我一个简单的问题 

1104
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,966
为什么我称这为基督教无神论？

1105
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,966
为什么我不简单地说这是唯物主义伦理？

1106
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:50,799
像这样 纯粹的善良 没有保证 

1107
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,733
在这里 当然 我是唯物主义者 

1108
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,166
这里没有误解 

1109
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:59,533
但我的好朋友 我真的很喜欢他 

1110
00:59:59,633 --> 01:00:00,433
好吧 不是好朋友 

1111
01:00:00,633 --> 01:00:01,066
我吹嘘 

1112
01:00:01,366 --> 01:00:02,366
我夸大其词 

1113
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,466
我见过他两次 

1114
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,099
我们相处得非常好 

1115
01:00:05,533 --> 01:00:10,266
你知道罗恩·威廉姆斯 左翼的坎特伯雷前大主教吗？

1116
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:17,699
在他的陀思妥耶夫斯基书中--我不喜欢陀思妥耶夫斯基 但我喜欢他的书--威廉姆斯的陀思妥耶夫斯基 

1117
01:00:18,033 --> 01:00:28,666
他在书中提供了我能想象到的最好的《白痴》解读之一 我不能克制不简短地向你描述这个 

1118
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:35,066
你知道 《白痴》的通常解读是 他对这个世界来说太神圣了 一个圣人 

1119
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,266
对于罗恩·威廉姆斯来说 这是一个奇妙的解读 

1120
01:00:39,533 --> 01:00:44,366
而且这非常真实 如果你知道陀思妥耶夫斯基《白痴》的故事 

1121
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:51,166
他不是纯粹的邪恶 《白痴》的米什金王子 而是一种更加精致的东西 

1122
01:00:51,933 --> 01:01:00,966
有些人 我见过他们 他们确实存在 他们真的是真诚的 无疑的 他们自身是善良的 

1123
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:08,833
但他们在他们的社会环境中的行为方式是一种错误的善良 

1124
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:14,633
他们绝对真诚地善良 但对他们四周造成了灾难 

1125
01:01:16,966 --> 01:01:19,466
例如 米什金王子 他造成了什么？

1126
01:01:20,133 --> 01:01:27,133
纳斯塔西娅·菲利波芙娜被别人谋杀 或者 他在自己周围引发了灾难 

1127
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:43,466
罗恩·威廉姆斯在他关于陀思妥耶夫斯基的书中提供了一个关于神圣维度最基本形态的精彩定义 

1128
01:01:45,633 --> 01:01:56,499
他提到了四位英国天主教小说家——奥康纳、珀西、斯帕克和埃利斯——并对他们作了这样的描述 

1129
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:05,933
所有四位都创造了一个世界 在这个世界里 世俗多数的观点被相对化了 

1130
01:02:06,533 --> 01:02:19,766
但没有一个简单的替代方案 任何人都不能仅凭一个决定或一系列决定就进入其中 从这个世俗现实的意义上来说 这是糟糕的 必须有一个更高的秩序 

1131
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:33,133
这些小说的宗教维度在于一种持续的不协调感 即使小说内的任何人都无法说出我们应该与什么相协调 这种不协调感也是不可忽视的 

1132
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:53,500
所以 我们的世界就是脱节的、不一致的、缺少某些东西 但这实际上是负面神学 不是通常意义上的负面神学 即上帝是如此超越以至于我们无法恰当地描述他 不 它简单地就是 上帝就是这种缺席 

1133
01:02:54,700 --> 01:03:00,466
这个空虚的位置出现在我们通过用上帝的形象来填补它之前 

1134
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:12,133
基本的神圣维度就是这个空虚 就是这个空虚 意味着我们的现实有着严重的问题 

1135
01:03:12,566 --> 01:03:16,466
我认为 不仅我们可以以唯物主义的方式思考这个问题 

1136
01:03:17,433 --> 01:03:24,566
而是我们只能以唯物主义的方式正确地思考这个问题 

1137
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,766
而这里的事情变得复杂了 

1138
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:35,166
我们应该拒绝马克思最著名的公式之一 即宗教是人民的鸦片 

1139
01:03:36,266 --> 01:03:39,033
首先 要小心 马克思并没有说是（某些人）给人民的鸦片 

1140
01:03:39,466 --> 01:03:41,633
这对马克思来说太粗俗了 

1141
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:45,966
不是像某种天真的启蒙形式那样 

1142
01:03:46,633 --> 01:03:58,833
一些邪恶的神职人员像哥伦比亚的毒贩那样制造宗教 对不起 我的错 我很抱歉 

1143
01:03:58,966 --> 01:04:00,499
不 它是人民的鸦片 

1144
01:04:00,866 --> 01:04:05,099
但你知道我今天对这个公式的主要反对意见是什么吗？

1145
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:10,699
是的 我们有一种宗教作为人民的鸦片发挥作用 

1146
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:17,499
当然 恐怖主义的原教旨宗教 但别忘了 不仅仅在穆斯林国家 

1147
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:19,366
我在这里是一个悲观主义者 

1148
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:28,899
你知道 在美国 FBI正在监视两百万名基督教原教旨主义者 怀疑他们可能是恐怖分子 

1149
01:04:29,266 --> 01:04:33,899
很抱歉告诉你 这基本上和阿拉伯人中的比例一样 你知道 

1150
01:04:34,433 --> 01:04:44,566
因此 问题不应该仅仅是伊斯兰恐惧症 而应该是在现代全球资本主义的辩证法中 是什么驱使人们走向原教旨主义 

1151
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:53,933
但好吧 这也许也是今天的宗教作为人民鸦片的一个版本 

1152
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,566
但至少还有两个 我认为阿多诺已经在某处提到了这个

1153
01:04:59,266 --> 01:05:02,099
我们有另外两种人民的鸦片 

1154
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,133
我希望你能猜到它们是什么 

1155
01:05:04,666 --> 01:05:05,833
鸦片和人民 

1156
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:10,266
对民粹主义者来说 他们的鸦片就是人民本身 

1157
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,666
你知道这个幻想图像 人民 等等 

1158
01:05:14,366 --> 01:05:17,099
玛丽娜·勒庞的鸦片是人民 等等 

1159
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:19,766
真正的法国人民受到威胁 

1160
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,733
另一种人民的鸦片就是鸦片 

1161
01:05:23,866 --> 01:05:26,799
对许多知识分子来说 鸦片就是毒品 

1162
01:05:27,033 --> 01:05:28,733
它就是鸦片 正如你所知 

1163
01:05:29,666 --> 01:05:36,833
所以摆脱它的方式 我支持宗教维度 但以这种纯粹抽象的方式 

1164
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:48,266
我没有时间去做 可以以这种意义给出一个精彩的解读来联系 既然这些家伙是丹麦人 联系上显而易见的人物 克尔凯郭尔 

1165
01:05:49,000 --> 01:06:04,866
他的宗教公式 当他说上帝与我们无关时 上帝正在与它自己相关 所有这些公式至少我认为接近某种非常悖论的唯物主义

1166
01:06:05,133 --> 01:06:13,799
我不想让你太厌烦 我希望你不要再次抗议我已经向你展示了太多的这种政治正确的疯狂行为 

1167
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:27,300
我的天啊 如果你 我 你知道 也当我谈论强奸时 人们声称你不应该用这么生动的术语或者什么来谈论 你知道 那是令人震惊的 

1168
01:06:27,866 --> 01:06:32,833
见鬼 它应该是令人震惊的 你知道 因为如果你只是抽象地描述它 

1169
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:38,900
那么它真的不会影响你 那就只是 哦 它就像官僚统计数据一样 你知道 

1170
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:42,333
不 你应该被正在发生的恐怖事情震惊 

1171
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,833
非常感谢你们的耐心倾听
