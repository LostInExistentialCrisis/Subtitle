1
00:00:00,484 --> 00:00:01,413
Good evening, everyone

2
00:00:04,484 --> 00:00:06,340
No, but it's indeed over venture

3
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:14,100
The brevets are swim Priatelli ma on eco a messada ne resume you koi

4
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:23,980
So the translation good evening to all our families complete translation, yeah, please

5
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:29,780
Yep, so good evening to everyone to all my comrades who don't understand me fuck them

6
00:00:30,545 --> 00:00:31,656
Is it a correct translation?

7
00:00:35,425 --> 00:00:36,495
So, what can I say?

8
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:44,186
Welcome to the sixth Soverzi festival and thanks for being with us for six years.

9
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:47,980
Thanks for everyone in this hall for being with us or to the new people.

10
00:00:48,942 --> 00:00:49,528
Thanks again.

11
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:54,877
There is no need to present Slavo into detail, but I

12
00:00:56,763 --> 00:01:01,997
I should mention that just two books were published during his visit to Croatia again.

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,816
The first one is published by Meander.

14
00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:06,992
It's Gledanij's Cosa.

15
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,233
And the second one is The Year of Jimic Dangerously, published by Fractura.

16
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,078
But the topic of today's lecture is, I think for all of you, much more interesting.

17
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,696
It's called Love as a Political Category.

18
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:28,715
I remember when I was trying to convince Slava in Ljubljana to take this topic, he was first, no, no, no, what can I say about love?

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,340
And then in the end, I got a mail a few weeks later and he said, okay, I will do this lecture.

20
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:37,658
So, let's see.

21
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,976
A big applause for Slava.

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:48,368
Oh my goodness.

23
00:01:50,871 --> 00:02:03,825
I hope you will not be disappointed because this time I will not do with any political interventions, it will really be about the concept of love, how can it be used politically.

24
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:13,044
First, a quote, if all else perished and he remained, I should still continue to be.

25
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,607
And if all else remained and he were annihilated,

26
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,167
the universe would turn to a mighty stranger.

27
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,068
I should not seem a part of it, end of quote.

28
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,687
This is how in Emily Bronte's Withering Hates,

29
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:39,744
Katie characterizes her relation to Heathcliff and provides a succinct definition of the unconditional erotic love.

30
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,008
There is an unmistakable dimension of terror at work here.

31
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:57,768
Think about the ecstatic trance of Tristan and Isolde, ready to obliterate the entire social reality in their immersion into the night of deadly enjoyment.

32
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:12,490
Now, I could go on here about erotic love because I sincerely think that in contrast to our youth, the youth of those who are already old here,

33
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:30,226
when you know to fight for sexual freedom was experienced as liberating and even monogamous love was considered or dismissed as a bourgeois convention and so on, I think that today more and more love,

34
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:38,667
simply passionate love is emerging as something dangerous and precisely subversing.

35
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:47,405
Think about how you are addressed in your everyday life by society, what society demands of you.

36
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,929
It's basically a kind of slightly spiritual pseudo-Buddhist hedonism.

37
00:03:53,050 --> 00:04:02,510
Ideology is telling you, be faithful to yourself, realize your true potentials and experiment with your life.

38
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,306
Try all different options.

39
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,770
Don't fixate yourself on certain stable identities.

40
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,427
Life is dynamic, fluid, and so on and so on.

41
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:21,988
And I claim within this economy, not only is stable love, passionate love,

42
00:04:22,651 --> 00:04:38,825
emerging as an obstacle to your authentic development but even the crucial dimension of love is gradually disappearing.

43
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:40,208
What is love?

44
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:51,118
As Alain Badiou, our good friend who wasn't able to come here, put it in his wonderful book In praise of love.

45
00:04:51,118 --> 00:04:54,988
There is always something traumatic, extremely violent in love.

46
00:04:54,988 --> 00:04:58,399
Love is a permanent emergency state.

47
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:06,483
You fall in love and it's crucial that in English and in French we use this expression, to fall in love.

48
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:07,425
You lose control.

49
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:20,669
It's really, I claim that love, the experience of passionate love, is the most elementary metaphysical experience it's a platonic experience,

50
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:34,493
in the sense of you lead your easy daily life you meet friends you go to parties whatever everything is normal maybe here and there wine nightstand but whatever

51
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:42,329
and then you passionately fall in love everything is ruined the entire balance of your life is lost

52
00:05:42,353 --> 00:05:50,553
everything is subordinated to this one person I almost cannot imagine in normal daily life outside war and so on

53
00:05:50,577 --> 00:06:09,077
a more violent experience than that of love and I think which is why all the advisors that we need today are trying precisely to domesticate or to erase this excess of love

54
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:27,301
it's as if love is too poisonous and then they tell you you know that The trick that they try to offer you, all the marriage agencies, dating agencies, is how to find yourself in love without falling in love.

55
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:42,772
This idea came to me when on one of the transatlantic flights I was in a, I read one of those stupid airline journals and there was a big text there claiming publicity,

56
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:53,896
text claiming we will enable you to find yourself in love without the fall, without this dangerous exposure.

57
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,249
And I think this fits perfectly our daily narcissistic metaphysics.

58
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,726
You know the old story that I repeat all the time.

59
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:12,482
We want coffee without caffeine, we want beer without alcohol, and we want love without its dangerous moment where you get lost.

60
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,840
But okay, enough of this.

61
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,265
Now this is Eros, erotic love.

62
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,649
Then we have its counterpoint in Christianity, agape.

63
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,786
Agape functions in a wholly different way, how?

64
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:35,488
It may appear that in contrast to Eros, with its violent subtraction from the collective space, the love for a collective succeeds in getting rid of the excess of terrorizing violence.

65
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:43,086


66
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:57,548
Does agape not imply an emphatic yes to the beloved collective, ultimately to the entire humanity, or even, as in Buddhism, to the entire domain of suffering life?

67
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,566
The first counterargument is provided here by the reply to a simple question.

68
00:08:04,111 --> 00:08:05,023
Just think about it.

69
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:14,762
Which political regimes in the 20th century legitimized their power by evoking the subject's love for their leader.

70
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:19,359
It was the so-called, I don't like the term, totalitarian ones.

71
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:33,306
Today, remember, it is only and precisely North Korean regime which evokes all the time the infinite love of the Korean people for Kim Il-sung, Kim Yong-il, and so on,

72
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:42,288
and vice versa, the radiating love of the leader for his people, love expressed in continuous acts of grace.

73
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,309
Kim Yong Il wrote a short poem along these lines.

74
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,407
I will quote you the entire poem, just two lines.

75
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:56,285
In the same way that the sunflower can only thrive if it is turned towards the sun,

76
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:04,862
the Korean people can only thrive if their eyes are turned upwards towards their leader, towards himself, of course.

77
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,408
Terror and mercy are thus closely linked.

78
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,645
They are effectively the front and the obverse of the same power structure.

79
00:09:13,191 --> 00:09:28,965
Only a power which asserts its full terrorist right or capacity to destroy anything and anyone it wants, only such a power can systematically universalize mercy.

80
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:33,008
Since this power could have destroyed everyone,

81
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,646
Those who survive are all still alive because of the mercy of those in power.

82
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:46,466
Consequently, the very fact that we, the subjects of power, are alive is the proof of the power's infinite mercy.

83
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:54,966
This is why the more a regime is terrorist, the more its leaders are praised for their infinite love, goodness, and mercy.

84
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:06,047
Theodor Adorno was right to emphasize that in politics, Love is evoked precisely when another democratic legitimization is lacking.

85
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:11,623
Loving a leader means you love him for what he is, not for what he does.

86
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,405
Okay, we may agree with this.

87
00:10:15,171 --> 00:10:19,325
So how about the next candidate for love as a political category?

88
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:30,267
The so-called oriental spirituality, Buddhism, with its, or so we are told, more gentle, balanced, holistic, ecological approach.

89
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:42,268
You know all the stories about how, say, when digging up earth for the foundation of a house, Tibetan Buddhists are careful not to kill any worms and so on.

90
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,178
In the whole of the last 150 years,

91
00:10:47,330 --> 00:11:04,507
Japan's rapid industrialization and militarization with the ethics of discipline and sacrifice was sustained by the large majority of Zen Buddhist thinkers who today knows that Daisetsutetaro Suzuki himself,

92
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:18,847
the high guru of Zen in the United States of the 1960s, supported in his youth in Japan of the 1930s the spirit of utter discipline and militaristic expansion.

93
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:27,579
There is no contradiction here, no manipulative perversion of some authentic compassionate insight.

94
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:40,185
The attitude of total immersion into the selfless now of the instant, the so-called Buddhist enlightenment in which all reflexive distance is lost,

95
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:53,188
in short, in which absolute discipline coincides with total spontaneity, perfectly legitimizes our subordination to the militaristic social machine.

96
00:11:53,530 --> 00:12:06,984
It's quite interesting to read this, to read Buddhist texts on war, where they claim that openly for ordinary people who don't have time to meditate for years,

97
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:19,688
the best shortcut towards overcoming your false self and reaching nirvana, satori, however we call it, is total subordination to the military discipline.

98
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:35,549
And Suzuki himself wrote a wonderful text where he even gives the advice to the military into how using Buddhism to make killing easier.

99
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:47,389
He says, if I persist in my everyday attitude of false belief that I have a self which is the free agent of its acts, then let us say I have to kill one of you.

100
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:58,348
Then this is difficult because you are here, I see it, I look into your eyes, I find it difficult, should I step the knife into you, I feel responsible.

101
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:04,985
Then Suzuki says, but if you reach Buddhist enlightenment, the thing gets much easier.

102
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,447
You no longer believe in your autonomous self,

103
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:26,708
you perceive yourself as just a void, anonymous, impassive observer of life around you, where phenomena simply are engaged in their cosmic dance, which is a totally neutral process.

104
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:39,948
And from this distance, as Suzuki puts it, you simply observe your knife in a cosmic dance of phenomena hitting the eye or the throat of your enemy and so on.

105
00:13:39,948 --> 00:13:44,740
Now this is no joking matter because I'm not blaming Buddhism for this.

106
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:55,549
I'm just saying how even the most radical spirituality is no guarantee that we will not be doing horrible things in our daily life.

107
00:13:55,549 --> 00:14:08,127
So again, what this means is that the Buddhist all-encompassing compassion has to be opposed to to the Christian, intolerant, violent love.

108
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,099
I want to praise the Christian love.

109
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:16,983
Although, Christians would probably lynch me for what I will say now.

110
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:26,347
The Buddhist stance is that of indifference, of quenching all passions, which strive to establish differences.

111
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:39,565
While the Christian love is a violent passion to introduce difference, a gap in the order of being, privilege and elevate some object at the expense of others.

112
00:14:39,565 --> 00:14:47,635
Love is violence not in the vulgar sense of the well-known Balkan proverb if he doesn't beat me he doesn't love me.

113
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:58,668
Violence is already the love choice as such which tears its object out of its context elevating it to the sublime absolute thing.

114
00:14:58,668 --> 00:15:08,587
In In Montenegro folklore, so I was told by Andrei Nikolaidis, my Montenegro friend, the origin of evil is a beautiful woman.

115
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:11,888
She makes men around her lose their balance.

116
00:15:12,331 --> 00:15:18,869
She literally destabilizes the universe, colors all things with a tone of partiality.

117
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:29,622
Among Christian theologists, it was Gilbert Keith Chesterton who fully assumed the consequences of this violent aspect of love.

118
00:15:31,211 --> 00:15:45,487
One has to get rid of the old platonic topos of love as eros, which gradually elevates itself from love for a particular individual through the love for the beauty of a human body in general

119
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:54,807
and then the love of the beautiful form as such to finally the love for the supreme good beyond all forms.

120
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:04,488
True love is precisely the opposite move of forsaking the promise of eternity itself for an imperfect individual

121
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:12,127
What if the gesture of choosing temporal existence, of giving up eternal existence for the sake of love,

122
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:20,588
From Jesus Christ to, for example, Sigmund in the Act II of Richard Wagner's Die Walkiere,

123
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:28,366
who, Sigmund, prefers to stay, to remain a common mortal if his beloved Sieglinde cannot

124
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,608
follow him to Valhalla, the eternal dwelling of the dead heroes.

125
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,446
What if this is the highest ethical act of them all?

126
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:44,064
I think this is the message of Christianity which is still alive.

127
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:57,708
Not forsake all terrestrial things for eternity, but love means I know you are a miserable mortal being, but I'm ready to forsake eternity itself for you.

128
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:12,807
Based on this insight, Chesterton rejected the fashionable claim about the alleged spiritual identity of Buddhism and Christianity.

129
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:18,509
Here is a well known, I want to repeat it, quote from Chesterton, from his orthodoxy.

130
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:23,765
Quote, love desires personality, therefore love desires division.

131
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:30,825
It is the instinct of Christianity to be glad that God has broken the universe into little pieces.

132
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:35,228
This is the intellectual abyss between Buddhism and Christianity.

133
00:17:36,554 --> 00:17:40,188
That, for the Buddhist, personality is the fall of man.

134
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:46,128
For the Christian, it is the purpose of God, the whole point of his cosmic idea.

135
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:56,184
The world soul of the theosophists or Buddhists asks man to love it only in order that man may throw himself into it.

136
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:03,617
But the divine center of Christianity actually threw man out of it in order that we might love it.

137
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,267
All modern philosophies are chains which connect and fatter.

138
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,827
Christianity is a sword which separates and sets free.

139
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:22,337
No other philosophy makes God actually rejoice in the separation of the universe into different living souls."

140
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:33,461
A tremendous violence does dwells in the very heart of the Christian notion of love for one's neighbor.

141
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:41,669
The violence which finds its most direct expression in a series of Christ's disturbing statements.

142
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,668
Here are some of these passages from gospels.

143
00:18:47,151 --> 00:18:47,943
Just listen to them.

144
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,826
You may be surprised what you find in gospels.

145
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:58,809
Christ saying, talking all the time, do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth.

146
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,725
I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.

147
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:13,908
For I came to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter in law against her mother in law, and men's enemies will be the members of his household.

148
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:22,426
He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."

149
00:19:23,051 --> 00:19:23,561
Next quote.

150
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:35,263
If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.

151
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,705
Next quote, the best one, I think.

152
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:42,303
Perhaps people think that I have come to cast peace upon the world.

153
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,401
They do not know that I have come to cast conflicts upon the earth.

154
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:49,025
Fire, sword, war.

155
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,146
For there will be fire in a house.

156
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,507
There will be three against two and two against three.

157
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:01,686
Father against son, son against father, and they will stand alone, the final quote.

158
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:04,868
So how are we to read this statement?

159
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,446
And believe me, I know what I'm talking about.

160
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:14,468
I'm asking all the time when I engage in debates with Catholic or Protestant or Orthodox priests,

161
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,828
I'm asking them, okay, just tell me what this means.

162
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,108
And it's incredible how they try to squeeze out, you know.

163
00:20:22,551 --> 00:20:26,649
One way is the, how should I call it, the linguistic one.

164
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:30,548
They claim, no, maybe hate is not the right translation.

165
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:37,948
That Christ just wanted to say, if you love some other people more than me, not to hate them.

166
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,582
I claim this is a blasphemy for a true Christian.

167
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:45,188
God appears here then as a stupid, jealous guy, you know.

168
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,287
You can love others, but be sure that you love me more.

169
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,845
That's an obscenity.

170
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:57,326
Or the best answer was given to me by a Polish priest in Warsaw during a debate.

171
00:20:58,111 --> 00:20:59,969
And I asked him, what does this mean?

172
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:05,626
And he told me, oh my god, I didn't expect this question today, I would need more time to prepare the answer.

173
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:11,266
To which I answered him, fuck you, you had 2,000 years to prepare the answer, you know.

174
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,386
I didn't pull out an unknown passage.

175
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:22,650
And it's, again, absolutely incredible how they are really not ready to provide a clear answer.

176
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,201
What do these lines mean?

177
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:34,065
To put it in a somewhat simplified way, there are two basic attitudes discernible in the history of religions.

178
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:41,368
On the one hand, there is the pagan cosmos, the divine hierarchical order of cosmic principles,

179
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:51,503
which, when copied onto society, gives the image of a congruent edifice in which each member is at its own place.

180
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,768
The supreme good is here, the global balance of principles,

181
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:01,428
and evil stands for their derailment or derangement,

182
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:07,126
for the excessive assertion of one principle to the detriment of others,

183
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:13,727
of the masculine to the detriment of the feminine, of reason to the detriment of feeling, and so on.

184
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:18,105
The cosmic balance is then reestablished through the work of justice,

185
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:27,224
which with inexorable necessity sets things straight again by crushing the derailed element.

186
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:37,968
With regard to the social body, an individual is good when he or she acts in accordance with his special place within the social edifice,

187
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:44,727
when he respects nature which provides food and shelter, when he shows respect for his superiors,

188
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:54,107
when he takes care of his followers or children in a fatherly way and so on and so on.

189
00:22:54,530 --> 00:23:05,288
And evil is defined as, evil occurs when some particular strata or individuals are no longer satisfied with their proper place.

190
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:14,725
Children no longer obey parents, servants no longer obey masters, rulers no longer take care of their subjects and so on and so on.

191
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:24,088
I think that this is the ethics which even now is re-emerging often in the guise of some New Age wisdom.

192
00:23:24,451 --> 00:23:33,167
It's called so-called holistic approach, you know, every element should remain at its proper place, evil is imbalanced and so on and so on.

193
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:38,206
I claim that Christianity does precisely the opposite.

194
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:54,288
Christianity introduces into the global balanced order a principle totally foreign to it, a The principle that, measured by the standards of a traditional cosmology, cannot but appear as a monstrous distortion.

195
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:02,170
The principle according to which each individual has an immediate access to the universality.

196
00:24:02,711 --> 00:24:09,969
In Christianity, the universality of the Holy Spirit, or today, the universality of human rights, freedoms, and so on.

197
00:24:10,711 --> 00:24:18,789
I can participate in this universal dimension directly, irrespective of my special place within the global social order.

198
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:25,949
So do Christ's scandalous words, which I quoted, not point in the same direction?

199
00:24:26,771 --> 00:24:36,070
Here, of course, we are not dealing with a simple, brutal hatred demanded by a cruel and jealous God.

200
00:24:36,571 --> 00:24:41,989
When Christ says if you don't hate your father and mother, you cannot be my follower.

201
00:24:42,672 --> 00:24:47,688
I think the point is not that you should simply hate them as living beings.

202
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:52,628
I think that in a very simple way you can resolve this dilemma.

203
00:24:53,210 --> 00:25:02,789
Father, mother and so on here stand or condense the entire hierarchical social order.

204
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:07,766
the network of relations of domination, subordination, and so on.

205
00:25:08,411 --> 00:25:17,029
So that the hatred Christ mentions is simply the hatred of established social hierarchy.

206
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:25,129
You are my follower if, instead of functioning as a part of social hierarchy order,

207
00:25:25,653 --> 00:25:33,343
you see as your true home, as it were, it were Holy Spirit and unconditionally egalitarian community.

208
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,953
Or as St.

209
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:54,745
Paul put it, it is love that enjoins us to unplug from our social community into which we were born so that, you know the passage, there are neither men nor women, neither Jews nor Greeks.

210
00:25:55,431 --> 00:26:02,722
This is, I think, the very, I'm simplifying you of course, but nonetheless, the very core of the Christian insight for me.

211
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:12,029
God dies, Christ dies, at the same time the Father dies, all that survives is Holy Spirit,

212
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:30,330
which is the first name of the Communist Party as we know, and radically egalitarian society which violently opposes social hierarchy, an immediate violent assertion of universal equality.

213
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:42,526
And it is against this Christian background that we should read Che Guevara's well-known statement on revolutionary love, a quote from Che Guevara.

214
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:50,427
At the risk of seeming ridiculous, let me say that the true revolutionary is guided by great feelings of love.

215
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:59,186
It is impossible to think of a genuine revolutionary lacking this quality, end of quote.

216
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,944
There is a further step to be made here.

217
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:13,726
Guevara's statement that the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love should be read together with his more problematic statement on revolutionaries as killing machines.

218
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,905
Now comes the other statement.

219
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:33,724
Hatred is an element of struggle, relentless hatred of the enemy that impels us over and beyond the natural limitations of men and transforms us into effective, violent, selective, and cold killing machines.

220
00:27:34,811 --> 00:27:35,662
That's the other quote.

221
00:27:36,391 --> 00:27:42,147
These two, apparently opposite stances, are united in Che Guevara's well-known motto.

222
00:27:42,711 --> 00:27:50,066
One must endure, become hard, toughen oneself, without losing tenderness, end of quote.

223
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:56,386
I think Guevara is here basically paraphrasing Christ's declaration of the unity of love and sword.

224
00:27:57,151 --> 00:28:11,147
In both cases, the underlying paradox is that what makes love angelic, what elevates it over mere unstable, pathetic sentimentality is its cruelty itself, its link with violence.

225
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:19,381
So while Guevara certainly believed in the transformative power of love, he would never have been caught humming all you need is love.

226
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:25,406
What you need is to love with hatred, or another strange bad fellow here.

227
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:35,967
As Seren Kierkegaard put it long ago, the necessary consequence, the truth, of the Christian demand to love one's enemy is,

228
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:42,987
quote from Kierkegaard, is the demand to hate the beloved out of love and in love.

229
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:53,626
So high, humanly speaking, to a kind of madness, can Christianity press the demand of love, is love is to be the fulfillment of the law.

230
00:28:54,250 --> 00:29:04,385
Therefore, it teaches that the Christian shall, if it is demanded, be capable of hating his father and mother and sister and beloved, end of quote.

231
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:14,387
With regard to social order, this means that the authentic Christian tradition rejects the wisdom that the hierarchical order is our faith,

232
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:22,104
that all attempts to mess with it and to create another egalitarian order have to end up in destructive horror.

233
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:31,464
Agape is political love, and following Terry Eagleton, this is how I would propose to translate agape, is simply political love.

234
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:41,463
Agape means that the unconditional egalitarian love for the neighbor can serve as the foundation for a new social order.

235
00:29:42,411 --> 00:29:50,545
The form of appearance of this love is the so-called apocalyptic millenarism or the idea of communism,

236
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:55,562
the urge to realize an egalitarian social order of solidarity.

237
00:29:56,251 --> 00:30:09,408
Love is the force of this universal link which in an emancipatory collective connects people directly in their singularity, bypassing their particular hierarchic determinations.

238
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:16,726
Terror is terror out of love for the universal singular others against the particular.

239
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,825
This terror names exactly the same as the work of love.

240
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,547
So my approach to the fundamental is terrorists,

241
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:30,165
Islamist or Christian, should be that precisely they are not terrorists in the right way,

242
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:34,428
that they shirk from authentic terror of the work of love.

243
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,103
Now you will be saying, am I crazy?

244
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:47,727
What distinguishes this from a murderous terrorist who kills but claiming I'm killing you because of your eternal soul and so on and so on?

245
00:30:48,410 --> 00:31:01,210
I will try to explain this in the remaining part by beginning with what is precisely the form of non-love today which poses as love, charity.

246
00:31:01,873 --> 00:31:06,210
one again of the names and practices of non-love today.

247
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:12,766
When we see an ad with starving children in Africa with a call to do something to help them,

248
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:17,965
like something like for the price of a couple of cappuccinos you can save their life and so on,

249
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:25,427
I claim that the true message is something like don't think, don't politicize, forget about the true causes of their poverty.

250
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:29,422
Just act, contribute money, so that you will not have to think.

251
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:34,487
In short, the true message is, for the price of a couple of cappuccinos,

252
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:44,707
you can continue your ignorant, pleasurable life, not only not feeling any guilt, but even feeling good for participating in the struggle against suffering.

253
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:52,643
So how would this notion of love, which is the opposite of charity, charity is false love,

254
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:57,926
because charity is love with the true aim of which is to make you feel good.

255
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,429
My God, what a great man I am, you see.

256
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:04,464
I'm helping all the children starving in Somalia and so on and so on.

257
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:10,144
How would the authentic, violent love help us to orient ourselves today?

258
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:18,289
Let me begin with a wonderful quote from last Christmas issue of the magazine Spectator.

259
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:26,924
In this issue, there is an editorial entitled why 2012 was the best year ever.

260
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:37,746
This editorial argues against the perception that we live in a dangerous, cruel world where things are bad and getting worse.

261
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,507
Here is the first paragraph of this editorial.

262
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:50,502
I quote, it may not feel like it, but 2012 has been the greatest year in the history of the world.

263
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:56,476
That sounds like an extravagant claim, it is borne out by evidence.

264
00:32:56,476 --> 00:33:01,188
Never has there been less hunger, less disease, or more prosperity.

265
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:13,989
The West remains in the economic doldrums, but most developing countries are charging ahead and people are being lifted out of poverty at the fastest rate ever recorded.

266
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:20,446
The death toll inflicted by war and natural disasters is also mercifully low.

267
00:33:20,446 --> 00:33:23,334
We are living in a golden age."

268
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,919
End of quote.

269
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:34,070
Now the first thing to add here, even if I, why not, I always like to concede to the devil what belongs to the devil,

270
00:33:34,331 --> 00:33:44,010
even many things are true in this statement, but the first thing to add is that people rebel not when things are really bad, but when their expectations are disappointed.

271
00:33:44,672 --> 00:33:54,140
French Revolution took place after the king and the nobles were for decades gradually losing their full hold on power.

272
00:33:54,140 --> 00:34:03,794
The 1956 anti-communist revolt in Hungary exploded after Imre Nagy, the reformist prime minister later shot by the Soviets,

273
00:34:03,818 --> 00:34:13,918
was already prime minister for two years and after relatively free debates among intellectuals were allowed.

274
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:14,130
Even

275
00:34:14,691 --> 00:34:30,904
A closer example, people rebelled in Egypt in 2011 because there was some minimal economic progress under Mubarak, giving rise to a whole class of educated young people who participated in the universal digital culture.

276
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:41,387
And this is why the Chinese communists are right to be in panic, precisely because on average Chinese are now living considerably better than 40 years ago.

277
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:49,782
But the social antagonisms between the newly reached and the rest exploded, plus expectations are much higher.

278
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,547
That's the problem with development and progress.

279
00:34:52,890 --> 00:35:01,144
They are always uneven, they give birth to new instabilities and antagonisms, they generate new expectations which cannot be met.

280
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:16,400
In Tunisia or Egypt, just prior to the Arab Spring, the majority probably lived a little bit better than decades ago, but the standard by which they measured their satisfaction was much higher.

281
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:33,227
So yes, the spectator is in principle right, claiming that we live in a golden era, but the very facts that the spectator emphasizes are creating conditions for revolt and rebellion.

282
00:35:33,227 --> 00:35:36,336
So again, what rebellion.

283
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:47,515
There is a more down-to-earth version of this claim of Spectator, which I often hear in mass media, especially when I visit non-European countries.

284
00:35:47,515 --> 00:35:50,870
They laugh at me and they say, crisis, what crisis are you talking about?

285
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:59,237
Look at the BRIC countries, Poland, South Korea, Singapore, Peru, even many sub-Saharan African states.

286
00:35:59,237 --> 00:36:01,424
They are all progressing.

287
00:36:01,424 --> 00:36:07,724
The losers are only West Europe and up to a point the United States.

288
00:36:07,724 --> 00:36:15,708
So we are not dealing with a global crisis, but just with the shift of the dynamics of progress away from the West.

289
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:33,039
It's important symbol of this shift, not the fact that recently many people from Portugal, a country in deep crisis, are returning to Mozambique and Angola, ex-colonies of Portugal, but this time as economic immigrants not as colonizers.

290
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:39,540
So what if our much-decried crisis is a mere local crisis in an overall progress?

291
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:47,806
Even with regard to human rights, is the situation in China and Russia now not much better than 50 years ago?

292
00:36:47,806 --> 00:37:03,959
Decrying the ongoing crisis as a global phenomenon is thus a typical Eurocentrist view and the view coming from leftists who are usually pride, who usually pride themselves on their anti Eurocentrism.

293
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:10,394
There is a partial truth in it and again admit what is true.

294
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:14,165
It's true that globally economy is progressing.

295
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:23,582
I mean the crisis in some sense is not global but nonetheless I think we should restrain here our anti-colonialist joy a little bit.

296
00:37:23,582 --> 00:37:29,764
The question to be raised is if Europe is in gradual decay what is replacing its hegemon?

297
00:37:29,764 --> 00:37:48,970
Capitalism with Asian values which of course has nothing to do with Asian people and everything with the clear and present tendency of contemporary capitalism as such everywhere to suspend or at least limit constrained democracy.

298
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:58,443
From Marx on the The truly radical left was never simply progressist, it was always obsessed by the question, what is the hidden price of progress?

299
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:04,648
Marx was fascinated by capitalism, by the unheard-of productivity it unleashed.

300
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,548
He just insisted that this very success engenders antagonisms.

301
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:16,490
And we should do the same with today's progress of global capitalism, keep in view its dark underside.

302
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:16,817
How?

303
00:38:17,572 --> 00:38:17,959
Where?

304
00:38:19,913 --> 00:38:28,050
First I want to note something about the status of universality because critics of universality,

305
00:38:29,093 --> 00:38:40,970
sorry, critics of Eurocentrism usually emphasize the ideological limitation, lie, deception of Western European universalism, claiming that for example, and they are right up to a point,

306
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:51,367
when we talk about human rights we privilege a certain ideological set of human rights specific of Western individualist societies and so on and so on.

307
00:38:52,050 --> 00:39:05,928
That's true, but the situation is a little bit more complicated, because in a properly dialectical Marxist perspective, yes, every universality can be false.

308
00:39:07,733 --> 00:39:12,089
It is always over-determined by some particular content.

309
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:23,647
For example, human rights, yes, but if you look closely at it, human rights secretly privilege white male people of some property and so on and so on.

310
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:28,008
So whenever we, it's clear that this is in some sense true.

311
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:34,509
For example, when we talk about Chinese philosophy, it's clear that we are doing a Eurocentrist operation

312
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:49,520
because philosophy, as we know it, emerged in Europe and if we apply the same notion to Chinese thought, that Chinese thought is automatically in a disadvantage, and so on and so on.

313
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:58,204
But this historicist relativism, beware how universality can be a false universality, is just one side of the story.

314
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:09,665
Marx is saying something, I think, which is much more actual today, that we are not only less universal than we think.

315
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:15,128
We think universal human rights, we privilege European, patriarchal, whatever rights.

316
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:21,508
We are also much more universal, much more universal than we think we are.

317
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:34,908
For Marx the uniqueness of capitalism is that as agents on a market, we ourselves as individuals occupies a universal position

318
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:51,468
in the sense that we relate to ourselves as universal subjects, universal in the sense that we are no longer fully rooted in or identified with a particular social, ideological, and so on positions.

319
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,046
It's not a universality with regard to others.

320
00:40:55,891 --> 00:41:06,608
I relate to myself as someone who, for example, today I'm an engineer, I lose this work tomorrow, I can be a taxi driver, then I don't know what.

321
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:12,928
Our particular field of work is experienced as something ultimately contingent.

322
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,988
The same goes for market commodities and so on.

323
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:20,369
So universality is a way of life, as it were.

324
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:23,906
It's a mode of our immediate experience.

325
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:36,648
And now the big question is what role with regard to the process of emancipation this brutal late capitalist universality,

326
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:44,586
this unheard of force of capitalism to dissolve our particular modes of life and so on has.

327
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:48,447
I want now to do something extremely problematic.

328
00:41:49,031 --> 00:42:03,547
I want to rehabilitate a text of Marx, rather two texts which are usually dismissed by post-colonial studies as embarrassing cases of Marxist racism and Eurocentrism.

329
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:06,279
He's too short from 1,853 articles on India.

330
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:14,942
The British rule in India and the future results of British rule in India.

331
00:42:16,111 --> 00:42:24,163
Marx admits here without restraint the brutality and exploitative hypocrisy of the British colonization of India,

332
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:31,728
which goes up to the systematic use of torture prohibited in the West, but outsourced to India.

333
00:42:33,271 --> 00:42:35,007
Really, nothing new under the sun.

334
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:40,247
There were Guantanamo's already in the midst of the 19th century British empire.

335
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:57,229
The quote from Marx, the profound hypocrisy and inherent barbarism of bourgeois civilization lies unveiled before our eyes, turning from its home,

336
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:02,228
where it assumes respectable forms, to the colonies where it goes naked."

337
00:43:02,591 --> 00:43:03,178
End of quote.

338
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:15,265
All that Marx adds is, quote, England has broken down the entire framework of Indian society without any symptoms of reconstitution yet appearing.

339
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:29,967
This loss of its old world, with no gain of a new one, imparts a particular kind of melancholy to the present misery of the Hindu and separates Hindustan, ruled by Britain,

340
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:35,247
from all its ancient traditions and from the whole of its past history.

341
00:43:35,751 --> 00:43:50,708
England, it is true, is causing a social revolution in Hindustan, a revolution which was actuated only by the vilest interests and was stupid in her manner of enforcing this interest.

342
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,447
But that is not the question.

343
00:43:53,850 --> 00:44:01,384
The question is, can mankind fulfill its destiny without a fundamental revolution in the social state of Asia?

344
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:05,268
If not, whatever may have been the crime of England,

345
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:13,128
she was, England was the unconscious tool of history in bringing about the revolution.

346
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:15,948
Now this is the Marx usually attacked.

347
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:23,124
One should not dismiss here the talk of the unconscious tool of history.

348
00:44:24,171 --> 00:44:33,128
Marx is not a naive teleologist, claiming oh, the British brutal exploitation of India was a tool of some higher historical reason

349
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,843
which made it an instrument of future progress and so on and so on.

350
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:44,188
All Marx claims is that the British colonization of India

351
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:57,582
unintendedly created conditions for the double liberation of India from the constraints of its own traditions as well as from colonization itself.

352
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:02,447
And there is not an empirical proof of this.

353
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,708
Do you know that the British tried to,

354
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:09,228
They were intelligent enough, the British colonizers,

355
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:25,148
they knew that if they allow their colonization to simply dissolve traditional ideological, social, Indian edifice, castes, and so on, that this may create revolutionary upheavals in India.

356
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:40,508
So it's interesting to notice how, from the very beginning of their colonialist critics' claim, British colonizers wanted us to lose our tradition and to impose Western standards.

357
00:45:40,831 --> 00:45:42,126
No, on the contrary.

358
00:45:42,530 --> 00:46:02,226
They put hard work into re-establishing some kind of resuscitating old, stable, value, ideological, religious systems, which would keep India a stable, inert society, ready to be exploited.

359
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:06,529
For example, the ultimate Indian ideological textbook,

360
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:10,028
The Loss of Manu, a pretty terrifying book,

361
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:16,366
a detailed justification of caste system with detailed descriptions what were to do.

362
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:24,369
You know, I learned with surprise for my Indian friends that in 17th century at least this book was half forgotten.

363
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,867
It was just lost in different transcriptions.

364
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:34,425
It is in the earlier 19th century that the British colonizers reestablished, resuscitated this book.

365
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:47,727
So I claim in this sense that all this topic about respect for local cultures and so on was from the very beginning the crucial part of the process of colonization.

366
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:52,929
British didn't want for the Indians to become like them.

367
00:46:53,430 --> 00:47:05,049
They want them in their inner traditional ways and they even went as far as to praise immensely the superiority of their spirituality.

368
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:10,728
The standard memoir of British colonizers in India reached something like that.

369
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,310
Yes, we may be richer materially, the British.

370
00:47:14,612 --> 00:47:17,370
Yes, we bring progress and industry to India.

371
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:25,370
But when you see a simple yogi saint praising there, don't you feel how worthless we are?

372
00:47:25,831 --> 00:47:33,389
Don't you feel the infinite depth of that simple spirituality and so on and so on.

373
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:35,987
I claim that this is absolutely crucial.

374
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:40,224
You take this false respect for the other from colonialism.

375
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:43,642
You lose colonialism itself.

376
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:46,405
What do we have to accept here?

377
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:48,205
We have to accept that.

378
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:52,710
A quote from another great delectician, Richard Wagner, from his Parsifal,

379
00:47:53,414 --> 00:47:56,127
Die wunder schlicht der spärnur der sich luch.

380
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:01,428
The wound can only be healed by the very spear that smote it.

381
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:06,168
That is to say, we should insist on what Marx insists.

382
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:12,048
On this radical, brutal, but radical ambiguity of colonization.

383
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:34,599
That is to say that it is the very power of social disintegration brought by, unleashed by colonization, all traditional forms of identity, traditional ethical morphs dissolve and so on, which at the same time opens up the space for liberation, also for anti-colonial liberation.

384
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:36,363
What do we mean by this?

385
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:39,906
Let me give you another example from India itself.

386
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:58,283
When I was there two years ago, I got into a heated debate with some Indian cultural theorists who complained about the fact that they had to use English language as their expression.

387
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:05,890
They claimed this is already a form of cultural colonization which censors our true identity.

388
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:08,727
They claim, can you see how strong colonization is?

389
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:18,227
Even now, when we try to formulate our project of liberation from colonialism, we have to do it in the language of the colonizers.

390
00:49:20,872 --> 00:49:22,306
This was a quote from one of them.

391
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:27,547
We have to speak in an imposed foreign language to express our innermost identity.

392
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:32,309
And that does not put us in a position of radical alienation.

393
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:38,105
Even our resistance to colonization has to be formulated in the language of the colonizer.

394
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:44,108
My answer to this was yes, but this imposition of English,

395
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:51,225
a foreign language, created the very x unknown quantity which is oppressed by it.

396
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:58,009
That is to say, and this was my message, and it's typical what happened to me.

397
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:09,968
I was shocked how this message was received differently among my partners in debate there, but in strict correlation to the social status.

398
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:15,243
The top Brahmin intellectuals shouted at me as colonizer blah blah.

399
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:20,930
The Dalits, the untouchables immediately accepted it.

400
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:27,185
Namely, my message was, it's true, when you are forced to speak a foreign language,

401
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:32,188
you feel deprived of the very core of your identity.

402
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:35,668
But my thesis is here a much more radical one.

403
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:45,883
It is that that which you feel deprived of is a specter engendered by this very colonial imposition of a foreign language.

404
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:49,868
In other words, it's a very refined dialectical paradox.

405
00:50:50,351 --> 00:50:59,729
If some of you are philosophers, Hegel uses a wonderful term, the absoluter Gegenstoß, the absolute recoil counterpounce for this.

406
00:51:00,772 --> 00:51:11,587
The very loss in appropriately dialectical notion of history, the very loss of something creates the lost dimension.

407
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:24,619
We don't have a pre-colonial India and then brutal colonization which makes the people aware what they lost and then in anti-colonial struggle they are trying to regain what they lost.

408
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:30,150
No, the pre-colonial India was something totally different.

409
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,005
It's irredeemably lost.

410
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:38,229
In so far as it's not lost, it precisely serves colonizers.

411
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:47,826
This new dimension that you are craving for, for example, in the case of India, a new modern democratic India,

412
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:56,327
the very program of decolonization is something engendered by colonization itself as a reaction to it.

413
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:09,708
Another example to make this clear, you know he's one of my heroes, Malcolm X, the great American, a little bit more violent than Martin Luther King, fighter for black rights.

414
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:17,308
You know why he has chosen this no family name, but just X, X unknown quantity instead of,

415
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:19,707
I don't know what family name.

416
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:32,706
Of course, at an immediate level, he wanted to emphasize how the blacks, by being torn out of their African ancestral homes, that they are deprived of their roots.

417
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:38,428
But the program of Malcolm X was not, so let's return to those roots.

418
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:48,009
But X means, what if we grasp this very void into which our enslavement put us?

419
00:52:48,370 --> 00:53:00,004
the fact that we don't have any genuine tradition to rely on, that we have to, as it were, collectively reinvent our identity as a unique opportunity of freedom.

420
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:04,790
And it's also clear that he followed this line.

421
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:11,087
At the end, we may debate it if he was right, he found the new universalist frame in Islam.

422
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:12,882
He became Muslim.

423
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:17,129
So he had no dreams about returning to origins.

424
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:32,705
If you want further proofs of what I'm saying, never forget in South Africa that it was the greatness of African National Congress that they absolutely resisted all the bullshit about returning to some authentic African roots.

425
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:43,568
The one who was preaching return to African roots was King Butelezi, a local king there, who as we all know was collaborating with apartheid forces.

426
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:48,449
He was even directly financed by the Pretoria apartheid government.

427
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:52,568
No, to see the truth of what I'm saying, you should really read history.

428
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:59,344
For example, you should read the apartheid, white racist justification of, well, apartheid system.

429
00:54:02,491 --> 00:54:04,409
It was not we whites are more.

430
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:11,888
Of course, it was this de facto, but the justification was something like what a precious difference of cultures we have here.

431
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:15,168
We have Bushmen, Hottentot, this, that.

432
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:29,404
If we allow them, if we give them equality in the modern sense, all this pressure, spiritual traditions, all we get lost in our vulgar westerns, mechanical, imperialist, non-holistic, whatever civilization.

433
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:36,469
The idea was strictly, of course, a fake multiculturalism, but nonetheless a multiculturalism.

434
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:40,906
And again, the greatness of Mandela and so on was always to insist.

435
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:49,345
No, we should beat the white people at their own feet by being more universal than they are.

436
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:55,090
And so again, back to, sorry, where are we?

437
00:54:55,150 --> 00:55:11,926
Yes, back to India, I think that the solution is not to look for some lost British identity, but it's a crazy paradoxical solution, but accepted by Dalits and so on,

438
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:18,186
to see decolonization as a welcome chance of getting rid of old rules,

439
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:32,329
and to take the fact that India is lacking, now is being deprived of their proper tradition, again, as a chance of achieving a much more open egalitarian democratic society.

440
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:39,169
And believe me or not, Western conservatives are becoming aware of it.

441
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:45,068
For example, I read a wonderful complaint by an American conservative linguist who says

442
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:57,248
we shouldn't be too glad about the primacy of English language because he says, and he was right, that the language, the English language which is now becoming lingua franca

443
00:55:57,950 --> 00:56:11,228
is no longer the old English of true British people, but it is an English spoken by Indian merchants in Mumbai by Singapore bankers and so on and so on.

444
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:18,209
The English itself as universal language is being stolen from British people themselves.

445
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:25,109
So again, this is what I see as the core of Marxist insight.

446
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:37,586
I don't believe in anti-colonial resistance on behalf of any return to some primordial lost roots and so on and so on.

447
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:47,857
If anything, we should advocate a never further universalization, further loss of our local or whatever roots.

448
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:58,503
Next point, and now I am approaching the end, I want to make very briefly is that what does this mean again for us concretely today?

449
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:08,763
There is a certain, how should I call it, paradigm which unites many modern, or not so modern, philosophers.

450
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:22,208
Let's call it Helderlin paradigm, by Helderlin I mean Friedrich Helderlin, the great German poet whose best known headline, as you know, is Wodas gefär ist wechs das retende Auch,

451
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:26,586
where the danger grows also what can save us.

452
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:34,169
The idea is that our epoch is the epoch of extreme danger, extreme alienation for Marx

453
00:57:34,831 --> 00:57:47,989
or loss of our roots in global technology for Heidegger, but at this point of extreme loss is also the opportunity for what Heidegger calls the care for the reversal.

454
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:51,148
When things are lost, there is a chance of reversal.

455
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:55,525
For example, the whole eschatology of Marx is based on this.

456
00:57:56,951 --> 00:58:04,970
Capitalism is utter alienation, workers are totally deprived of all of the substantial objective conditions of their work

457
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:17,666
but this very deprivation liberates them from all particular roots, creates them as universal subject who may reappropriate the universal substance.

458
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:26,410
The next, my final thesis is that I think we should resist this paradigm of we are at the moment

459
00:58:27,172 --> 00:58:36,487
You know, dangerous time, the very limit, everything is almost lost, but maybe there is a chance in this total enslavement for total liberation, whatever.

460
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:46,149
I think on the opposite that Hegel, our situation is much closer to that experienced by Hegel.

461
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:47,827
We had a revolution.

462
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:56,126
For Hegel it was the French Revolution, for us the communist attempts of the 20th century and other attempts, and it's obvious,

463
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:10,788
although Hegel's critique of French Revolution is a complex matter, but it's obvious that things went terribly wrong in Stalinism and so on, or for Hegel in the French revolutionary terror and so on.

464
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:19,149
And the whole problem of Hegel, if we read him properly, is how in these conditions of failure,

465
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:30,108
when, for example, communism, the way we experienced it in the 20th century was a fiasco, globally, more or less, not totally, but nonetheless.

466
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:41,828
How to save the legacy, how to remain faithful to it, how to do it again, how precisely not to betray what was worth fighting in it,

467
00:59:41,852 --> 00:59:58,452
because the fiasco of communism was used not only by anti-communist but in a much wider sense by ruling ideology to put in question basically the entire legacy of modernity.

468
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:04,348
You know first it began with communism is over, it was a dangerous utopia.

469
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:23,725
Then as you probably know it went on into because of this lucky or unlucky coincidence 1789, 1989, 200 years, that an era which began with the French Revolution is over, in 1789, this egalitarian modern era.

470
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:37,388
Then you can go further, modernity, all modernity was a fiasco, no wonder that, and you can feel this even in TV series, Game of Thrones, or all this desire for a new neo-gothic universe,

471
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:54,768
that there is a big unease with modernity and you find here strange bad fellows from extreme right which basically claims that it all began with Luther or European modernity,

472
01:00:55,270 --> 01:01:11,748
all horrors began there up to a person for whom I have a great admiration, for example Evo Morales, president of Bolivia, who said capitalism killed mother nature, as if the catastrophe started there.

473
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:13,048
No, it didn't.

474
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:19,728
I think that more than ever today, when we are faced with all horrors of global capitalism and so on and so on,

475
01:01:19,752 --> 01:01:41,252
more than ever, I claim, we should remain faithful to this Marxist insight that modernization is a radically ambiguous process and that any return to pre-modern values traditions only serves to accelerate,

476
01:01:41,276 --> 01:01:51,276
to strengthen what is most dangerous in modernization, that the only way out is through bringing modernization to its end.

477
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:55,087
And now to conclude, really this brings me back to the beginning.

478
01:01:55,830 --> 01:02:08,786
We encounter here the very dilemma with which I began, the two ways, either this holistic pseudo-oriented, because with Buddhism things are much more complex, but I will not go into it now,

479
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:20,310
this idea of holistic global harmony, universal compassion, which will close the wound of modernity, or to accept that

480
01:02:20,334 --> 01:02:35,434
the wound itself, by wound I mean this cut of of modernity, violent interruption of traditional order by modern universalism, beginning with Christianity and so on, or that this is our only salvation.

481
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:49,666
Since there were no dirty jokes, I would nonetheless like to begin or to end with a very dirty joke that I heard, believe it or not, in Ramallah from a Palestinian Christian.

482
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:52,285
They are wonderful people, sense of humor.

483
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:55,066
He told me this joke about Jesus Christ.

484
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:59,205
The night before Jesus was arrested and crucified,

485
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:04,509
he was there praying alone in the tent, Jesus Christ.

486
01:03:04,931 --> 01:03:11,789
His followers, apostles gathered around the tent and started to worry, like Christ was still a virgin.

487
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:23,290
He didn't have sex and they say, my God, our Lord did so much to us, so many great things and he will die tomorrow being crucified without any joy and happiness.

488
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:29,708
So why don't we make at least the last evening of Jesus Christ, why don't we bring some joy to him?

489
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:36,728
So they call Mary Magdalene and ask her to go to the tent where Christ is resting and to seduce him.

490
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:42,304
Of course, being who she was, Mary said, oh, with pleasure, and went there.

491
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:52,047
Now, after five minutes, Mary Magdalene came out running with a totally horrified cry.

492
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:56,368
And apostles were wondering, what happened there, my God?

493
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,423
Is Christ secretly a pervert?

494
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:00,863
Did he torture her or what?

495
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:02,782
No, no, she explains.

496
01:04:03,571 --> 01:04:05,888
I slowly, everything went well at the beginning.

497
01:04:06,251 --> 01:04:08,646
I slowly undressed, I spread my legs,

498
01:04:09,290 --> 01:04:13,404
I showed to Christ my pussy, but then catastrophe started.

499
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:17,007
He said, what a terrible wound is there.

500
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:20,945
He put his hand up in and healed it, made it whole, no?

501
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:30,044
I am, so beware of the people too intent on healing other people's wounds.

502
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:41,768
I claim in exactly the same way, if today's advocates of anti-eurocentrism were to find themselves in actual pre-colonial reality,

503
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:47,665
they would have undoubtedly uttered the same horrific scream as Mary Magdalene did.

504
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:49,906
There is no way back.

505
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:56,807
We have to play to the end the game of, or whatever we call it, of modernist project.

506
01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:00,389
I think this is the greatest temptation today, precisely.

507
01:05:00,711 --> 01:05:02,726
Even if it's called anti-imperialism.

508
01:05:03,391 --> 01:05:05,488
I am totally against imperialism.

509
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:13,147
I just think we should never, never forget that anti-imperialism is also a very much misused word.

510
01:05:14,232 --> 01:05:24,850
Remember that when they started to fight the British and so on, Germans and Japanese fascists were regularly using the term anti-imperialism and so on and so on.

511
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:35,870
You know, I'm against imperialism, but I am not ready to sacrifice the legacy of European modernity.

512
01:05:36,572 --> 01:05:54,402
Precisely that passionate model of love, agape, universal love, love which is not the wisdom of keeping a distance, but fully falling into it, full engagement, losing oneself without reserve.

513
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:59,327
For me, wisdom is not all that Star Wars pseudo-Oriental bullshit, you know.

514
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:02,729
Don't attach yourself too much to worldly object.

515
01:06:03,071 --> 01:06:06,247
No, attach yourself to the end over the object.

516
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:07,989
That's the only way out for me.

517
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:10,224
With all the risks this involves.

518
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:34,819
Thank you very much.

519
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:36,950
Thanks, Lavoy.

520
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:39,468
What can I say after the joke with Magdalena?

521
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:43,918
We have, I think, enough time.

522
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:46,156
You deserve it, because the talk was boring.

523
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,039
There is a better one also told to me, but this one is not obscene.

524
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:50,793
It's very loving.

525
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:59,840
If you want to understand what is identification in psychoanalysis, identification as basic alienation.

526
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,415
You always identify with a decentered point.

527
01:07:03,201 --> 01:07:05,296
It's another story about Christ.

528
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:13,419
The idea is when he was tired from all his work of religious blah, blah, stuff, Jesus Christ said, I need a holiday.

529
01:07:13,581 --> 01:07:18,095
So he took one of the apostles and went to play golf on Galilee Sea there.

530
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:23,636
So okay, he was not a good golf player, so when he hit the ball, the ball fell into the sea.

531
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:29,557
Not a problem of Christ, you know, he knows how to walk on water, so he went there,

532
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:33,938
walked, looked down, ah, picked up, the ball went back.

533
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:42,699
Came back and then the apostle told Christ, but listen, this is simply too difficult a hit for you.

534
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,037
You know, you cannot do it.

535
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:46,976
Even, even, who is the big guy?

536
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:51,698
Tiger, Tiger, even Tiger Woods couldn't have done it.

537
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:59,816
Christ says, wait a minute, Tiger Woods is an ordinary black guy, I'm a god, I can at least do what Tiger Woods can, and he tries again.

538
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:04,397
But he misses again, and again goes to walk on the water.

539
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:17,259
At that point, and I like this historical nonsense, I mean, at that point a group of American tourists comes by on a tour there, step out and look at it, and one of them looking

540
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:22,338
goes to a apostle and says, who is that idiot walking on the water there?

541
01:08:22,338 --> 01:08:22,940
What does he think?

542
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,726
Who does he think he is?

543
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:25,488
Jesus Christ?

544
01:08:25,488 --> 01:08:27,876
The apostle says, no works.

545
01:08:27,876 --> 01:08:29,100
He thinks he is Tiger Woods.

546
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:35,187
So you see, even God needs a foreign identification.

547
01:08:35,187 --> 01:08:36,849
Even Christ needs Tiger Woods.

548
01:08:44,261 --> 01:08:44,763
Questions?

549
01:08:44,763 --> 01:08:48,380
Okay, there is a first question there already.

550
01:08:49,822 --> 01:08:51,726
The question is pretty short and simple.

551
01:08:51,726 --> 01:09:00,380
Yesterday you said that you do not want to be mobilized politically longer than two months in order to, I don't know, be able to do your philosophy.

552
01:09:01,608 --> 01:09:03,380
Are you ready to be in love longer than two months?

553
01:09:03,441 --> 01:09:05,380
That's a really good question.

554
01:09:05,701 --> 01:09:08,168
That's a good question.

555
01:09:08,168 --> 01:09:12,220
If we were to live in a real democratic socialist Stalinist society,

556
01:09:12,721 --> 01:09:17,360
this would be the last question you would ask, and tomorrow the question would have been,

557
01:09:18,023 --> 01:09:21,235
who was the last one to see you alive?

558
01:09:21,235 --> 01:09:22,079
Quite seriously.

559
01:09:23,603 --> 01:09:26,552
Let me answer like this.

560
01:09:26,552 --> 01:09:35,499
In matters of love, it may sound stupid and shocking, but yes I'm extremely I know it's difficult but miracles do happen by miracle

561
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:58,838
I mean love which lasts for life for example there was a French ecologist social theorist whom we know I'm sure that if he were to be still alive he would be here with us today how we do pronounce Andre Gortz He wrote, I forgot the title, a wonderful...

562
01:09:59,948 --> 01:10:00,857
Yeah, is it translated?

563
01:10:01,803 --> 01:10:04,457
Yeah, it's an incredible book.

564
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:10,179
When he was a young guy immediately after the war, he fell passionately in love.

565
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:14,677
He was Austrian Jew living in France with a British girl who was also in France.

566
01:10:15,581 --> 01:10:19,998
And for 58 years, they were absolutely in love.

567
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:31,313
And at the end, when she was dying of cancer, when she was approaching the end, he killed herself with her together.

568
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:34,574
It's an incredibly touching, simple story.

569
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:40,697
I'm not saying this happens regularly, but the miracle of love happens.

570
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:46,218
And I think even that I'm absolutely not saying anything conservative here.

571
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,380
I'm saying something very even leftist revolutionary.

572
01:10:50,501 --> 01:10:52,857
It's on the contrary, as I hinted at the beginning,

573
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:58,519
the mass media propaganda who tried to convince us, you know, everything is changing.

574
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,118
You have to experience life.

575
01:11:00,362 --> 01:11:01,097
No, I don't do it.

576
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:06,553
When I find the right woman, the right person, I don't want to experience too much other life.

577
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,757
So I think simply that this is the difference.

578
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:20,210
I am opposed to that cheap Freudo-Marxism from my youth where the idea is that sexual is political in the immediate sense.

579
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:24,639
Revolution should be a big fuck, and you know, like, and so on.

580
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:31,759
And if you are in love with one woman, it's the elementary form of bourgeois individualism, whatever, and so on and so on.

581
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:51,500
So as to politics, first, I wouldn't say that what I was targeting at when I said, I don't want to be for more than two weeks politically engaged fully, that I didn't target agape love.

582
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:58,600
What I target is this, a certain dismissal of ordinary people that I find here.

583
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:06,377
I spoke with many leftists, sincere leftists, who said, look how easily people are corrupted.

584
01:12:07,989 --> 01:12:09,519
You offer them something.

585
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:12,617
After two, three months, they get tired of mobilization.

586
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:15,134
But wait a minute, can we even?

587
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:25,895
I found nothing dismissive or cheap or corruptive in the fact that an ordinary person wants his peaceful decent life and so on and so on.

588
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:30,870
I'm not ready to betray this as some form of alienation or whatever.

589
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,733
That was only my point.

590
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,998
Not that nothing can be changed at that everyday level,

591
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:46,178
But that on the contrary, the only changes which truly count are those changes at the very everyday level.

592
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:48,573
They are the most difficult changes.

593
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:59,958
And this also concerns my other point, that today, maybe we no longer live in an ideological era in a big sense, like projects to die for.

594
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:08,358
But true ideology is in everyday life, what you buy, how you consume, what you desire, and so on.

595
01:13:08,781 --> 01:13:10,098
There, a change there.

596
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:21,075
This is what Alexis, who is now back in Greece, was telling us before when he says that what is happening now in Greece, it's not just a political change.

597
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:26,753
It is something at the level of everyday ethics that is changing.

598
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:42,199
So to answer briefly and unambiguously to your question, I think that here precisely we get a difference between erotic love passion and political passion.

599
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,897
Political passion is temporary limited.

600
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:47,435
Erotic, if it's authentic, it's not.

601
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,519
I'm here absolutely romantic.

602
01:13:49,600 --> 01:14:00,175
I think that even if it doesn't actually last forever, I still am for divorce and so on, myself having some practice in it.

603
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:10,137
But even if it doesn't last, when you engage, it should be, how should I put it, within the prospect of eternity.

604
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:15,455
When you are authentic, you cannot be authentically in love and already counting.

605
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,770
Let's say that now, haha, we are in love.

606
01:14:19,781 --> 01:14:25,058
And that you know, like, do you think, shall we say two months, three months, then we will have to rethink it or what?

607
01:14:25,422 --> 01:14:25,933
It's over.

608
01:14:26,341 --> 01:14:29,199
Even if it's an illusion, it's a structural illusion,

609
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:32,233
It must be the prospect of eternity.

610
01:14:33,881 --> 01:14:34,792
So I have a question.

611
01:14:35,521 --> 01:14:37,239
You obviously divorced several times.

612
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:38,851
Why do you marry again and again?

613
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,637
I will end up in Gulag, I know.

614
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:44,280
You will disappear much faster than here.

615
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:44,382
No?

616
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,798
I mean, we remember the old.

617
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:58,497
Don't you have that point in American Constitution that those who were accused of being communist in the which can't, that the Fifth Amendment, no?

618
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,556
I refuse to answer this question

619
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:02,995
because the answer may incriminate me, no?

620
01:15:03,821 --> 01:15:05,194
Something along these lines.

621
01:15:05,861 --> 01:15:07,657
Okay, give us some political questions then.

622
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:11,736
There is a question, yep.

623
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:20,914
Yeah, I'm trying to make some sense out of all of this mess I've just heard, but trying to connect the beginning and the end.

624
01:15:22,001 --> 01:15:27,698
Is it possible that communism as such failed because it was mostly tried in countries

625
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:34,498
that were basically Christian, and with our understanding of love as it is kind of selfish,

626
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:40,569
this is what exactly in some sense prevented the countries that tried communism to truly achieve it.

627
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:48,875
As long as we love one another instead of everyone, which should be as it is on the paper, but in reality it's not,

628
01:15:48,899 --> 01:15:56,299
does this religious understanding of love prevent true communism from happening ever on planet Earth?

629
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:56,952
Nice question.

630
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:58,585
this question.

631
01:15:58,585 --> 01:16:04,306
No, seriously, you know, in what precise sense, but nonetheless, I'm not sure that I agree with it.

632
01:16:04,306 --> 01:16:16,119
First, I wouldn't, you know, it's very dangerous when we are talking about the causes of the obvious, at least general, I wouldn't say it was on all

633
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:21,576
levels a total failure, but generally the failure of 20th century communism.

634
01:16:21,576 --> 01:16:21,797
You know,

635
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:29,840
It's a very dangerous game to engage in this cultural thinking, because it was too western, too eastern.

636
01:16:30,201 --> 01:16:33,196
And I got this lesson wonderfully when I visited Russia.

637
01:16:35,745 --> 01:16:41,920
You know that European communists, even we, ex-Yugoslav communists, like to play this game.

638
01:16:42,662 --> 01:16:49,920
Ah, you know, Stalinism was there because, you know, Russia is half Asiatic, Oriental, barbarian tradition.

639
01:16:50,161 --> 01:17:00,477
So a revolution happened in a stupid despotic Asiatic country, so that's why there was Stalinism, which is absolutely not true.

640
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:06,379
You can prove how all the elements can indeed emerge also in the version of the same logic.

641
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:15,334
But what surprised me in Russia was that when I visited then some conservatives, they told me the exactly opposite story.

642
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:26,338
Russia was good, authoritarian but tolerant, organic, and then all the evil comes from the West, from violent Western modernizers.

643
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:33,893
They draw a line from a little bit, even the terrible, but then especially Peter the Great up to Stalin.

644
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:41,519
So for them, communism was a Western rationalist, whatever, brutal imposition on.

645
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:43,635
So you know, these games are dangerous.

646
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:54,357
Even when you say West, but wait a minute, in China, I don't think you exactly can call Mao a great Christian.

647
01:17:54,960 --> 01:18:05,098
But nonetheless, if you look at the victims of not so much cultural revolution, I concede that there was an authentic aspect in cultural revolution.

648
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:13,385
But for example, the great leap forward of the late 50s, which was a brutal event beyond imagination.

649
01:18:13,385 --> 01:18:29,057
Now even the Chinese Communist Party itself is carefully releasing figures and the sad thing is that the figures are higher than those estimated by harshest dissident critics of communism.

650
01:18:29,057 --> 01:18:40,426
Dissident critics claim that 30-35 millions probably died from 58-9 till 61, the hunger following the great leap forward.

651
01:18:40,426 --> 01:18:45,585
Now the official numbers are definitely over 50 millions who died.

652
01:18:45,585 --> 01:18:48,714
So you know like I wouldn't play this game.

653
01:18:48,714 --> 01:19:02,299
What I would nonetheless because you know that was also not that I blame Buddhism the point of my negative only here otherwise it's more complex reference to Buddhism

654
01:19:02,801 --> 01:19:15,460
I totally reject this idea that our Christianity has a more totalitarian character and so on, while Buddhism is more holistic, peaceful.

655
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:23,259
No, no, you find extremely brutal regimes justified in Buddhist terminology also.

656
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,480
As to universal love, now you touch the crucial point.

657
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:29,015
I don't have time to go into it.

658
01:19:29,701 --> 01:19:36,579
I would say that for me, an authentic communist perspective would not be love for humanity.

659
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:48,338
Here I admire Marx, you know, when they were debating, when Marx was writing with the English Communist Manifesto and they were debating what should be the slogan with their fellows.

660
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:55,900
And some of them proposed things like, all men are brothers, love of mankind, and Marx just acidly answered,

661
01:19:55,924 --> 01:20:03,424
no thanks, there are quite many people whom I don't want to be my brothers and quite many people I don't want to love and so on.

662
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:16,256
So I think, I think that it's always something wrong in proclaiming directly universal love in this simple all-encompassing sense.

663
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:22,559
Because I think that this type of love is always founded on an exception.

664
01:20:23,001 --> 01:20:27,217
I love you all always when you scratch deep enough.

665
01:20:28,021 --> 01:20:38,934
something like, I love you all, and I love you all so much that I am ready to kill all those who destroy, who undermine your universal welfare.

666
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:54,236
For me, the ultimate example of this universal love is, do you remember the single most sublime seen for me from disintegration of communism in 89.

667
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:08,866
In East Germany, you remember when the system was falling apart, there was one of the last sessions of the official still communist, I think, people's assembly,

668
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:19,490
where he was already being attacked, but he tried to defend himself, who he, Erich Milke, the ultimate, the boss of Stasi, organizer of state terror and so on,

669
01:21:19,514 --> 01:21:33,014
and then when people started to shout at him, look on YouTube, you find everywhere this clip, he looked surprised when people started to mocking, he said, but I love you all, but I love you all.

670
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:42,353
I don't think this was hypocrisy, I mean, terror is for me always grounded in a false universal love.

671
01:21:43,201 --> 01:21:53,279
I think that authentic love is always, the majority of the people are stupid idiots, I'm ignorant, but ah ah ah, maybe I love you, or you, or you, just you.

672
01:21:53,681 --> 01:21:57,078
I much more believe in this particular exclusive love.

673
01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:00,257
Now you will say, what about agape that I was saying about?

674
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,236
This is for me strictly love as a category of struggle.

675
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,316
It's not love in the sense of I love you all.

676
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:12,797
It's the sense of, let's establish solidarity.

677
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:18,278
The only universality that I admit today is the universality of struggle.

678
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:24,759
Which is why I hate this UNESCO idea, don't all human cultures have something in common.

679
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:32,757
Then you end up with those absolutely boring UNESCO world reports, this culture is nice, that culture is nice, no.

680
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:38,619
I think, on the contrary, the only universality is, we have here our problems.

681
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:41,178
In Egypt, they have problems.

682
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:50,339
In United, is there a common front of each of us fighting in our country against an enemy?

683
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:51,695
That's love.

684
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:53,775
That's love as a category of struggle.

685
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:54,644
Absolutely.

686
01:22:57,942 --> 01:23:22,796
I think it can be nicely proven how all brutal violence done in the 20th century was, on the contrary, a sign of impotence only.

687
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:27,799
This is what brought me so much trouble in the United States when I said to provoke people

688
01:23:28,161 --> 01:23:30,716
the problem with Hitler was that he wasn't violent enough.

689
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:34,576
That is to say, he killed millions, but why?

690
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,378
Because he was afraid to really change social relations.

691
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,816
His violence was not heroic violence.

692
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:46,338
Hitler's violence was, in Nietzsche's terms, a reactive violence, a protective violence.

693
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:53,269
Even with Stalin, his single most violent act probably, the forced collectivization in the late 20s.

694
01:23:54,160 --> 01:24:12,069
It was a clear act of despair in the sense of the violence unleashed there was an enactment of the utter failure to find a solution to how to include farmers into the process of socialism.

695
01:24:14,421 --> 01:24:15,573
So you see my point.

696
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:24,156
I think that brutal direct physical violence is, as a rule, a sign of impotence.

697
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,756
When you are really strong, you don't need physical violence.

698
01:24:29,661 --> 01:24:34,259
I thought you wanted to avoid Yanis Varoufakis' question, but you won't.

699
01:24:34,521 --> 01:24:34,726
Please.

700
01:24:35,381 --> 01:24:41,818
Slavoj, a most wonderful representation of the wondrous discontinuity which the act of falling in love is.

701
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:51,778
But let me add, juxtapose it against another discontinuity, suicide, which is also a major break with the self.

702
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:57,556
And I'm mentioning that in the context of your quotation from The Spectator,

703
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:11,074
because as we speak, Foxconn, which produces our iPhones, has electrified the roof because of 720 suicides that happened by Chinese workers jumping off.

704
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:17,796
At the same time, we know that in India, the number of farmers that have committed suicide,

705
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:25,137
victims of genetically modified experiments with their crops by Monsanto and the rest.

706
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:33,097
And these suicides, both in Foxconn and in India, which I'm just using paradigmatically here,

707
01:25:34,721 --> 01:25:38,516
go completely hand in hand with spectacular economic growth,

708
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:45,532
because the farming communities that use these GM crops, statistically speaking, are booming, and so is Foxconn.

709
01:25:46,201 --> 01:25:52,278
And despite the fact that workers in Foxconn worked for 12 hours in Dickensian conditions,

710
01:25:52,720 --> 01:26:05,877
conditions that Engels described so well about Manchester in the conditions of the English working class, that in macroeconomic statistics that the spectator takes seriously

711
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:10,358
represents the golden age that that article mentions.

712
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,194
But we need to stiffen our lip.

713
01:26:12,781 --> 01:26:18,297
besides saying what Engels was saying and what Marx was saying, that the Industrial Revolution and capitalism

714
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:32,680
is wonderfully ambiguous in that it simultaneously and dialectically generates immense unprecedented wealth and unheard of depravity and deprivation.

715
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:43,356
Despite that, you are quite right to insist, and we are quite right to insist, that this is nevertheless a crisis of capitalism even measured by GDP standards.

716
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,335
Because let's say, you mentioned the BRICS,

717
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:48,713
which they celebrate in the spectator and the economist and so on.

718
01:26:49,461 --> 01:26:51,919
None of these countries are self-sustaining.

719
01:26:52,081 --> 01:27:03,478
All of them are net exporters, depending on the capacity of the Atlantic states, on the one hand, the United States and the other, Europe, to absorb those net exports.

720
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:07,998
Neither Brazil nor China can maintain that growth.

721
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:17,937
they are, in a sense, completely embroiled in the capitalist crisis which is unfolding in Europe and America.

722
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:33,455
So we have a growth which is utterly corrupted by massive rises in human pain, and at the same time we have a growth which is not even sustaining by its own criteria.

723
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,433
So you need to stiffen your lip a bit.

724
01:27:38,626 --> 01:27:41,018
Let me emphasize this as I totally agree with you.

725
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:44,259
Let me begin with things that you said about Foxconn.

726
01:27:44,602 --> 01:27:47,360
Because I already wrote about it, I even didn't know about this detail,

727
01:27:47,842 --> 01:27:56,198
but already what I knew about, what I knew long ago about, okay, two years ago about Foxconn, it's wonderful, wonderful in the terrifying sense.

728
01:27:56,641 --> 01:28:04,058
For example, do you know, I read in a report given to me by a Chinese friend, do you know that as a reaction to this suicide,

729
01:28:04,942 --> 01:28:18,511
Foxconn, it's a wonderful measure that Michel Foucault would have loved as biopolitics and moralisation that Foxconn now makes their employees, it's the condition of getting employed there,

730
01:28:18,535 --> 01:28:28,135
sign an anti-suicide pact where you promise that you will not kill yourself, okay that's ridiculous, but now comes the better part,

731
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:40,459
and you must oblige yourself that if If you see any of your neighbours, colleagues at work in a too depressed mood, that you will quickly report him.

732
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:49,018
The other thing is that this electrification that you mentioned is a further step from what I heard a year or two ago,

733
01:28:49,042 --> 01:28:57,842
and I love this, is that since these buildings they are putting together iPads, blah blah, are multi-store buildings and they were jumping from app,

734
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:25,220
they were placing around the windows large networks, you know, that's what I call capitalism with a human face, you know, so that if you jump down we will not die, you get caught in a network and but do you know then the most obscene thing which caused scandal even in China is that the boss of network visited somewhere, was it Shanghai or Taipei, I don't know where, one of the big zoos,

735
01:29:26,262 --> 01:29:46,675
and in an extremely open, tasteless way, he directly commented that I have to organize the cohabitation in my factories of so many living beings, animals, that I would like a lesson from a zoo, park, how you get this, and so on and so on.

736
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:49,493
So I totally agree with you.

737
01:29:50,140 --> 01:30:01,299
I also absolutely agree with your second point, which is that, of course, there is a growing crisis, and it's a structural crisis.

738
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:13,238
I'm trying to read economists, you, Lazar, to my American friends, to understand what it is about, but I absolutely agree with you.

739
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:20,578
simply think that it's a dream, and it's the most dangerous utopia that we have today.

740
01:30:21,621 --> 01:30:37,346
It's a dream that if we somehow, how to put it, just concentrate and don't do too much and just ameliorate things here and there, then somehow we will manage and the world, the way it is, will survive.

741
01:30:37,346 --> 01:30:48,838
No, I think we already are in an incredible social change change, of deteriorating ethical standards, political standards, and so on and so on.

742
01:30:49,440 --> 01:31:01,817
For example, what I always like to mention, are we aware what kind of ethical counter-revolution this is, that all of a sudden now, in a silent way, although there is some resistance,

743
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:09,948
torture of political prisoners is silently, it silently became publicly acceptable, and so on and so on.

744
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:13,797
No, I think that it's not just that the system is going on.

745
01:31:14,341 --> 01:31:15,373
Things are changing.

746
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:17,178
Things are changing.

747
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:19,038
We are in the middle of the change.

748
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:25,318
And as with all great changes, we are not even aware how things are changing.

749
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:34,699
The only thing I maybe didn't quite get is, what do you mean by that, Stephen Leaps?

750
01:31:35,081 --> 01:31:36,036
I agree with you.

751
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:39,336
It's this terrifying impact, and so on, and so on.

752
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:45,939
But OK, and then just if you can shout back at me quickly, can you just then answer?

753
01:31:46,060 --> 01:32:08,020
But then where I stand is that I'm again fully aware of all of this, but I sincerely don't believe that any reference to or reliance on some pre-modern forms of solidarity will help.

754
01:32:08,241 --> 01:32:11,099
That's what the Chinese are precisely trying to do it.

755
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:15,018
I spoke in China with their low level, I admit, functionaries.

756
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:20,755
And they told me that's the basis of their support for religion.

757
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:24,672
Don't be deceived by that anti-Buddhist campaigns and so on.

758
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:27,440
This is only when religion is politicized.

759
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:38,916
But basically, Chinese government is spending billions on religion because they are fully aware that with this violent destabilization, social disintegration,

760
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:48,040
and they are at the same time aware that communist ideology can no longer seriously provide social homogeneity.

761
01:32:48,081 --> 01:32:56,300
So they play either with patriotism, a kind of Confucian patriotism, or directly with religion.

762
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:00,914
I think they are absolutely sincere in their appraisal of religion.

763
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:09,631
All I'm saying is that I don't believe in this option, because it's, for me, at its most elementary, a fascist option.

764
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:11,356
This is fascism.

765
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:18,698
We can get modernization if we stabilize it with some forms of ancient hierarchy and so on and so on.

766
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:26,354
That's the only thing on which I would insist, as it were, that there is nonetheless no way back.

767
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:30,038
But the irony of what you said, I'm fully aware of.

768
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:34,078
Even do you know that this is the most brutal, sad thing.

769
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:47,636
The greatest number of farmers suicides in India are in, how is called the area, it's Bengali, around Kolkata, West Bengal, I think.

770
01:33:48,721 --> 01:33:49,738
No, east, whatever.

771
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:50,532
OK, there?

772
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:51,313
Where?

773
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:54,217
The irony is that for 30 years or more,

774
01:33:54,701 --> 01:33:58,368
local communist power, communists were in power there.

775
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:01,998
And they did a very successful thing, I was told.

776
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:05,117
They distributed land to small farmers.

777
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:09,239
And West Bengal, for a long time,

778
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:13,918
importer of food within India, started to export food now.

779
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:15,658
And that's the sad thing.

780
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:22,440
It's the communists in power who became these global market modernizers, claiming, oh, it's no longer good enough.

781
01:34:22,541 --> 01:34:24,399
Small farmers, we have to modernize.

782
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:30,458
And again, they triggered, I think, in the tens of thousands, farmers, head of families,

783
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:34,940
who cannot take of their family and simply kill themselves.

784
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:38,757
And we have the very careful here about what we read in our media.

785
01:34:39,121 --> 01:34:45,880
For example, you remember it was reported all around our media, this couple of gang rapes.

786
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:47,755
You know, a girl, I don't know where,

787
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:51,818
raped with five men in a bus and the whole.

788
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:56,518
Yeah, but my friend from India, Arundhati Roy, the writer,

789
01:34:57,240 --> 01:35:03,137
wrote a wonderful comment where she pointed out why was there such a universal outcry?

790
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:08,359
Because the five rave piste were poor, lower class people.

791
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:11,355
She wrote, if you are really horrified by it,

792
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:22,475
my God, go to Bombay and look at the totally tolerated by those in power structure of their whore houses, prostitution houses.

793
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:30,816
It's a complicated network where regularly agents are sent to poor parts of India or Nepal

794
01:35:31,641 --> 01:35:45,299
buying girls aged from five, six years already who are simply sold by poor farmers and then they are either immediately used in bordellos

795
01:35:45,841 --> 01:35:51,649
or, even worse, kept as slaves reserved for rich customers and so on and so on.

796
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:56,297
When you have all that horror there and everyone knows it,

797
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:02,080
it is a little bit hypocritical to focus so much on that rape.

798
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:13,993
I mean, if you really worry about suffering of sexually abused women, just go to Mumbai and look around a little bit in those.

799
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:17,011
Well, since you asked, I'll just tell you very quickly.

800
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:19,827
When I said, Stephen, your lip.

801
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:29,936
What I meant was, when we read articles like that from The Spectator, what we should say is, yes, you have a plethora of small truths,

802
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:36,937
on which, however, you are building a scandalous lie, just like Joseph Goebbels has taught you.

803
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:41,097
I totally agree here with you, and there are, okay, sorry.

804
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:49,706
No, no, here, I totally agree with you, And this is a nice example of how ideology functions today, you know.

805
01:36:50,541 --> 01:36:54,377
It's in the selection, you don't even have to tell the truth and so on.

806
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:59,036
And I think when you use the gables here, you used a wonderful example.

807
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:02,414
Because you know, I like to say this to shock my friends.

808
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:09,594
For example, when you debate with the Nazi who is ferociously anti-Semitic, the Jews.

809
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:14,698
You should never limit debate simply just to facts.

810
01:37:15,141 --> 01:37:16,436
Facts can be manipulated.

811
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:24,918
For example, if a Nazi from late 30s in Germany tells you Jews are seducing our German girls,

812
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:29,319
well, of course, probably, and I hope they did, some of them did it and so on.

813
01:37:29,441 --> 01:37:30,676
It's at least partially true.

814
01:37:31,081 --> 01:37:38,538
If they say Jews are exploiting German workers, not all but some of the Jews were rich and so on and so on.

815
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:40,796
So you see, the point is not this.

816
01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:45,350
The moment you accept the debate at this point, you are lost.

817
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:53,018
But still, you know what's the problem for me of the left?

818
01:37:53,420 --> 01:38:09,797
It is nonetheless, and I ask you now as an economist and so on, like what, it's a stupid question and it's the $1 million question as in a TV show because all of us, where in In what do you see the solution?

819
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:17,580
In a more socially controlled neo-Keynesian capitalism in this, in this, can you give us a general sense of orientation?

820
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:20,596
Do you want me to do it now?

821
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:22,216
Yeah, please give it.

822
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:23,891
Yeah, but in like five, ten seconds.

823
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:25,525
Ha, ha, ha.

824
01:38:27,384 --> 01:38:27,629
Okay.

825
01:38:28,180 --> 01:38:28,888
In two sentences.

826
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:38,616
We need a Keynesian stabilization just because the free fall is not revolutionary and it It only helps the Nazis.

827
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:39,630
The second question.

828
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:46,598
One stabilization is achieved that buys us breathing ground in order to dream dangerously about the good society.

829
01:38:52,752 --> 01:38:55,818
There was another question here, yeah.

830
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:57,088
Thank you.

831
01:38:57,680 --> 01:39:09,040
I'll change the topic back to love and while you were speaking, I was thinking of a movie that brings up this love as a political category.

832
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:17,978
I don't know if you have seen it, this Life of Others, which I think it's a rather stupid movie about this police officer, secret police officer.

833
01:39:18,361 --> 01:39:19,054
Oh, you know, okay.

834
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:30,354
So you know that there is this particular transformation of the secret police officer when he watches the couple being completely in love, making passionate love, and so on and so forth.

835
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:39,678
So basically the message is that, okay, once you are exposed, even as a evil secret police officer, once you're exposed to this beautiful miracle of love,

836
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:47,975
you transform yourself and you basically break with your institution and everyday life rules and you turn good.

837
01:39:48,601 --> 01:39:54,276
And I was wondering to what extent or where do you draw the line with your own theory of love

838
01:39:55,161 --> 01:40:04,560
from this bourgeois or if you want modern, modern bourgeois category of love, which is in itself also sort of claiming universal and claiming this particular break with the mundane reality.

839
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:06,460
So what is the particular gift that you...

840
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:07,116
Nice question.

841
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:12,718
First, I would say the Stasi officer, he doesn't fall in love.

842
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:15,117
He falls with a certain, he's an observer.

843
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:20,038
But now, if you permit me, we all know what we are talking about.

844
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:26,134
Lebend are the lives of others, the well-known German film, blah, blah, got the Oscar and so on.

845
01:40:26,721 --> 01:40:31,096
I think this is, I am also like you totally opposed to this film.

846
01:40:32,404 --> 01:40:36,754
My first reading is that it's almost a modern version of Casablanca.

847
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:40,658
Beneath official topic of heterosexual love,

848
01:40:41,161 --> 01:40:44,679
it's clearly the final line of the film could have been,

849
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,296
this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

850
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:50,938
Between the writer and the Stasi agent,

851
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:53,894
and clearly the woman has to be sacrificed.

852
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,738
We get rid of the woman, the true couple is created.

853
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:01,158
Second thing, the movie, that's the paradox.

854
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:04,798
Although the author is ferociously anti-communist.

855
01:41:05,281 --> 01:41:09,334
And a friend of mine in Germany who knows the director, even explained to me why,

856
01:41:09,941 --> 01:41:13,413
he comes with this complicated phone donner schmuck, I don't know what.

857
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:20,319
He comes from East Prussian family, which never forgave the Soviets to take their castle from them.

858
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:22,976
No, so this film is a personal revenge.

859
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:30,460
But the irony is that the movie is not harsh enough against the horror of police rule.

860
01:41:30,561 --> 01:41:31,231
You know why not?

861
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:34,119
What's the hypothesis of the woman?

862
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:35,031
You know the story.

863
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:45,698
Young successful writer with a beautiful woman, some high political minister, even whatever, functionary, falls in love with the woman

864
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:56,314
and he orders secret police to cover the husband totally, to discover something so that he will get rid of the husband to have the woman.

865
01:41:57,300 --> 01:42:02,019
What a terrible miss, what a terrible falsification.

866
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:07,958
The whole, listen, what happens in this film could have happened in any society.

867
01:42:08,401 --> 01:42:16,539
If you are, if you have a relatively powerful position, a CIA agent can do this, a top executive.

868
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:25,698
That is to say, the liberal limit of the film is that it locates evil in one of these private vices.

869
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:28,518
You want money, you want sex, whatever.

870
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,035
You do something criminal.

871
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:33,538
But the true horror of Stasi in dead air

872
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:35,294
was the following one.

873
01:42:35,961 --> 01:42:39,379
Imagine that there is no wicked minister who wanted,

874
01:42:39,721 --> 01:42:44,137
if you are the writer, sorry to be personal, imagine there is no secret,

875
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:48,295
there is no high nomenclature guy who wants to fuck your wife.

876
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:53,257
There are only, under quotation marks, good policemen like the hero,

877
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:55,735
And you would still be under observation.

878
01:42:56,440 --> 01:43:09,917
You know, instead of showing how total control was part of this, imagine a writer like the hero of the film, whose plays are performed in the West and so on, it's unimaginable in dead air

879
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:16,860
that such a person, irrespective of who wants to fuck his wife, would not be under permanent observation.

880
01:43:16,980 --> 01:43:19,099
And again, so you see the paradox.

881
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:23,838
This film paints the portrait of horror of dead air,

882
01:43:24,580 --> 01:43:27,397
it's much too modest, which is why,

883
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:29,254
although it's a little bit kitty,

884
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:32,777
I prefer the other film, Goodbye Lenin, why?

885
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:46,175
Because the fundamental premise embodied in the fate of the mother of that film is that the only way to survive, if you are an honest communist, is that you go crazy, to put it bluntly, no?

886
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:50,640
It's a, you know, it's not just Ostalgie as they criticized it.

887
01:43:51,122 --> 01:43:55,359
But you know, did you see the third film by, I forgot the director, Barbara?

888
01:43:57,161 --> 01:44:08,099
It's a third, a newer film about an East German women doctor being displaced onto some Baltic Sea resort,

889
01:44:08,381 --> 01:44:14,596
falling in love with a local guy who has to report on her, but he's also have this event.

890
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:18,394
This is also definitely better film than Lebendorf Anderon, no?

891
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:24,999
I think that was hopefully for us one, how do you call it, one-hit wonder of that guy.

892
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:28,236
Didn't he do that phone, whatever, the Prussian cast loner?

893
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:34,139
Didn't he do some horrible film with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp?

894
01:44:35,337 --> 01:44:35,459
Sorry?

895
01:44:36,185 --> 01:44:37,454
Yeah, didn't he do that one?

896
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:40,728
And it's horrible, so we are rid of that guy.

897
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,205
So there is another question, yeah.

898
01:44:49,241 --> 01:44:59,438
Hello, I want to ask you about, imagine that everything goes like you say, like the perfect love, the perfect world, the perfect earth, the perfect everything.

899
01:45:00,621 --> 01:45:08,115
And what happens next when we are leaving each other and appears our real nature?

900
01:45:11,341 --> 01:45:15,573
Real a real nature is like everybody can be an assassin.

901
01:45:15,573 --> 01:45:15,813
You know.

902
01:45:15,813 --> 01:45:27,295
It's like everybody can be like a murder you must just push a button and Our nature is like we are a natural born killers.

903
01:45:27,295 --> 01:45:28,539
I wouldn't be no I'm not ideal

904
01:45:32,864 --> 01:45:39,780
No first I would have said that You know I have no great believe in what you call human nature

905
01:45:40,241 --> 01:45:53,800
I always oppose this spontaneous communist idea that if you are for a new, more solid society, that you must somehow believe in essential goodness of humans and so on.

906
01:45:53,961 --> 01:45:55,827
No, I tend to agree spontaneously.

907
01:45:55,827 --> 01:45:59,178
Like many intelligent Marxists, like look at Bertolt Brecht.

908
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:03,800
He said in a wonderful short text that humans are by nature evil.

909
01:46:04,041 --> 01:46:11,377
You cannot change humans, you can only change conditions to take from the people possibility to actualize their evil or whatever.

910
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,698
But on the other hand, you know,

911
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:15,717
things are a little bit more complicated.

912
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:19,355
When you say we are all natural born killers,

913
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:21,617
I wouldn't put it like this.

914
01:46:21,820 --> 01:46:32,557
I would put it like we have maybe a certain propensity for violence, for acting out, which can be put to many different uses.

915
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:35,199
It can be turned into, you know what I mean?

916
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:39,916
The problem, I don't see a great, I don't see a great problem here.

917
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:53,802
I think, you know, it's the same problem as, for example, if you talk with intelligent geneticists, biologists, and they tell you, all of them, who are real, professional scientists,

918
01:46:53,826 --> 01:47:02,226
and they tell me, forget about all that bullshit, we discovered a gene for homosexuality, for jealousy, for religion, it's all bullshit.

919
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:12,834
These are very vague tendencies and it turns on the combination with other genes, how they turn out, and it's the same I think with this human nature.

920
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:32,477
I doubt that there are, I'm not saying, I never, let me be clear in this way, when I talk about communism and so on, no, I'm not even saying there will be, if there will be a society which will overcome capitalism.

921
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:37,416
I'm not even saying there will be more happiness there, and so on, or whatever.

922
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:40,017
Less suffering, and so on, and so on.

923
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:46,338
I'm totally the most brutal realist you can imagine here.

924
01:47:47,662 --> 01:47:52,896
On the top of it, I think I didn't use the word ideal.

925
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:55,796
I used the word miracle.

926
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:57,157
I believe in miracles.

927
01:47:57,320 --> 01:48:02,059
I think life is shit, but I believe, in a materialist way,

928
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:06,018
miracles happen, and that's for me the greatness of ethics.

929
01:48:06,561 --> 01:48:10,738
I knew people who were total shit, conformists, and so on,

930
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:13,977
and at some point they say, fuck it, I have it enough.

931
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:17,797
I will not take this, and they become momentarily heroes.

932
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:21,718
A great figure from history for this, Giordano Bruno.

933
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:24,958
We only know about his, you know, how he was burned,

934
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:31,218
But until that final moment, he was just walking around, slandering, compromising, and so on.

935
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:33,677
All of a sudden, you have the moment of a miracle.

936
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:39,856
And I read a wonderful similar story of a top German Nazi officer.

937
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:44,017
He was not a mega anti-Semite, but he was a pretty nasty guy.

938
01:48:44,740 --> 01:48:48,437
He was helping, organizing, Holocaust, blah, blah, blah.

939
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:53,019
At a certain point in 43, something broke down in him.

940
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:57,699
And he said, no, I cannot go on with this anymore.

941
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,799
And he risked his life to save Jews and so on and so on.

942
01:49:02,161 --> 01:49:04,818
So no, I don't believe in any good human nature.

943
01:49:05,121 --> 01:49:06,094
I believe in miracles.

944
01:49:06,620 --> 01:49:08,857
I believe that while life is generally shit,

945
01:49:09,260 --> 01:49:10,637
things happen here and there.

946
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:12,717
You know, we all, I don't, you,

947
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:16,178
we all cheat our wives, our husbands, it's all bullshit.

948
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:19,677
Fuck it, once here and there you find Andre Gorbs.

949
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:20,386
You know?

950
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,339
And that's enough for me, almost.

951
01:49:22,481 --> 01:49:23,214
I'm very modest.

952
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:25,377
I just need a miracle here and there.

953
01:49:33,740 --> 01:49:37,917
Yeah, since our simultaneous translators are working all the day,

954
01:49:38,281 --> 01:49:40,118
and please, a big applause for them as well.

955
01:49:42,649 --> 01:49:45,280
I know what they will be doing now.

956
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:49,219
They will hate me so much for me talking fast

957
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:52,838
that immediately they will go home or to a store,

958
01:49:53,340 --> 01:49:55,337
buy a voodoo doll of me,

959
01:49:55,740 --> 01:49:58,097
and they will be putting needles in, you know,

960
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:01,619
to take so that then I will awaken with pains as a revenge.

961
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:03,953
And I understand you fully for doing that.

962
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:08,114
But the question is, what did they do translate right now?

963
01:50:09,380 --> 01:50:12,657
I hope you did what I once saw when I was young.

964
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:20,136
A wonderful documentary on, you remember if you are old enough, there was Duvalier dictatorship in Haiti.

965
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:26,737
And then there was baby Duvalier, the stupid son, big fat guy who was a dictator.

966
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:31,538
And I saw on TV a press conference with him.

967
01:50:32,061 --> 01:50:35,716
And a Western journalist asked him, what's the economic situation in Haiti?

968
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:38,937
And Duvalier just said, well, it's not too bad.

969
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:46,216
And then the translator translated this in view of the recent stock exchange trendings and that theory and so on.

970
01:50:46,601 --> 01:50:48,477
I hope you did the opposite, no?

971
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:52,580
I go on for 10 minutes, and you say, he's just bullshitting.

972
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:54,103
He doesn't have a good answer.

973
01:51:03,941 --> 01:51:05,135
So one last question.

974
01:51:05,601 --> 01:51:06,173
Who will it be?

975
01:51:07,681 --> 01:51:09,091
If there are no questions?

976
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:12,938
No, I will be the pseudo-Buddhist or Heideggerian.

977
01:51:13,241 --> 01:51:22,060
If there are no questions, then you should listen to silence itself as the ultimate answer, you know, and clap with one hand to it, okay?

978
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:23,920
Unfortunately, there is a question without silence.

979
01:51:24,081 --> 01:51:27,315
There's one brief question, I'll try to make it brief.

980
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:39,978
It's about a book written by a young French historian and philosopher, I think her last name is Decree, I bought that book for my mom's birthday,

981
01:51:40,481 --> 01:51:43,677
so I haven't read all of it, but I read the main part.

982
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:59,027
Anyway, the main part is about Mussolini as such, and Hitler, which really made quite an impression on me. made quite an impression on me.

983
01:51:59,027 --> 01:52:21,525
My point is they were major leaders, they were seen as strong characters, Il Duce, Der Führer, and all that, whilst when we read their letters to their mistresses.

984
01:52:21,525 --> 01:52:42,589
They were quite fragile, very unstable, and even there's a letter from Mussolini to one of his mistresses where he says, that is so miserable, poor, doesn't know how to cope, how to manage without her.

985
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:46,937
And there's this notion of love, and yet power,

986
01:52:48,620 --> 01:52:59,638
which reflects this lack of power in the Lacanian sense, we could say, and how would you comment

987
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:11,277
that a person is on one side a great leader and on the other side a very weak person and

988
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:24,237
has no friends, has numerous mistresses and so on, but he's a person who has no self-confidence.

989
01:53:26,021 --> 01:53:29,177
On the other side, a great leader.

990
01:53:30,061 --> 01:53:34,117
I think I can give you a very brief and precise answer.

991
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:43,373
What I don't believe in is that this intimate self-experience is some kind of a deeper truth about that person.

992
01:53:44,020 --> 01:53:47,217
I think that the truth is outside in what Mussolini was doing.

993
01:53:47,880 --> 01:54:00,737
And I think that this self-image of a vulnerable, fragile person is precisely the lie he invented for himself to be able to do the horrors he was doing publicly out there.

994
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:03,359
And this goes generally, you know.

995
01:54:03,540 --> 01:54:08,959
I don't think that, because if you approach it in this way, it's not only Hitler and Mussolini.

996
01:54:09,220 --> 01:54:14,968
I'm absolutely sure that Stalin played and loved his daughter Svetlana and so on and so on.

997
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:33,225
All dictators or generally men, evil men, the more they are brutal, the more they need some private fetish when they can say, or for example, with big bank managers and so on.

998
01:54:34,121 --> 01:54:39,578
that the same role is played by private donations and charities.

999
01:54:39,578 --> 01:54:45,095
You know you're a manager of a big bank brutally destroying lives of 10,000 then in the

1000
01:54:46,740 --> 01:54:51,338
afternoon you say but it's horrible what is happening in Somalia let me give 2%

1001
01:54:52,101 --> 01:54:56,460
on my wealth to them and you feel so good and you can tell yourself you see

1002
01:54:56,842 --> 01:55:06,139
that's just business that I'm ruining hundreds of thousand this is the true me This fragile person who is ready to cry with you, this is it.

1003
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:14,119
So again, to put it very brutally, I think that we don't lie just to others.

1004
01:55:14,461 --> 01:55:19,320
We lie especially to ourselves, and especially when we do horrible things.

1005
01:55:19,882 --> 01:55:24,738
We need, as it were, a private myth, how we present ourselves to others.

1006
01:55:26,083 --> 01:55:30,320
My God, this is a dream of a very great man who does horrible things.

1007
01:55:30,862 --> 01:55:40,078
To present him celibate, you see, if you were to see me alone, you would see that I'm also a modest person with all the weaknesses and so on and so on.

1008
01:55:40,540 --> 01:55:53,698
Which is why I claim that maybe even the fundamental form of ideology today is I'm not just embodiment of economic or ideological categories, I'm also a warm, fragile human person.

1009
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:54,850
That's the lie.

1010
01:55:55,380 --> 01:56:00,636
That's why I like Brecht, where, in a brutal way, he doesn't allow for that.

1011
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:06,818
He precisely reduces capitalists or people to their social roles.

1012
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:18,378
Like, the big rule of Brecht is, please don't come up with that bullshit, what a beautiful, deep, profound, careful person you are privately for yourself, and so on and so on.

1013
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:21,978
That's, for me, not even something specifically communist.

1014
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:27,434
This is what I see even already the great legacy of Jewish ethics.

1015
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:30,198
It's a totally intersubjective ethics.

1016
01:56:30,561 --> 01:56:32,358
It's not, oh, no, no, wait a minute.

1017
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:34,878
I am very critical of, wait a minute,

1018
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:39,957
I am usually accused in Israel of up to preparing a new Holocaust and so on.

1019
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:42,280
I am part of the boycott there.

1020
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:49,136
So I am not, but my criticism of state of Israel is, I think, more intelligent.

1021
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:57,918
What I'm claiming is that the greatest threat to what was great in Jewish identity comes from the state of Israel, the way it works now.

1022
01:56:58,361 --> 01:57:08,258
If the tendency, if what they are doing now will go on, in one, two generations, Jews will be just another boring colonialist nation like all the other,

1023
01:57:08,541 --> 01:57:13,358
all that was great in Jewish tradition, their implicit universality and so on will be lost.

1024
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:20,457
But what I want to say that the greatest of traditional Jewish ethics is the total externalization.

1025
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:24,639
The truth is not, but what did this know?

1026
01:57:24,780 --> 01:57:34,318
The truth is in how you interact with others, not in how did you experience it in your insight, what did it mean to your spiritual growth.

1027
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:41,438
I think that all these categories of authentic self-experience, inner spiritual growth, and so on are bullshit.

1028
01:57:41,721 --> 01:57:44,297
I believe in total externality.

1029
01:57:44,740 --> 01:57:46,957
To give you another from my old books example,

1030
01:57:47,461 --> 01:57:53,575
my favorite story about ethics is how it was told by an old black friend for me from South Africa.

1031
01:57:53,940 --> 01:58:02,735
In the old days of apartheid, a policeman was dispersing a black demonstration.

1032
01:58:03,380 --> 01:58:07,198
And one policeman was running after,

1033
01:58:07,761 --> 01:58:12,911
and she was trying to escape him, a black lady, probably middle class with high heel shoes and so on.

1034
01:58:13,340 --> 01:58:14,969
Then something weird happened.

1035
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:21,879
Trying to run away with high-heeled shoes, which doesn't work well, made the lady drop.

1036
01:58:22,141 --> 01:58:23,113
She lost one shoe.

1037
01:58:23,700 --> 01:58:34,854
And at that point, the policeman, and I must emphasize this, it's not that he was inherently a good person or what, but this totally superficial manners took over.

1038
01:58:36,540 --> 01:58:43,455
When you see a lady in distress, and she stopped, took the shoe, and give it to him, here it is, lady.

1039
01:58:44,300 --> 01:58:47,580
And then they looked at each other, and they felt stupid.

1040
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:50,619
Like, now that she has the shoes on, what's she to do?

1041
01:58:50,761 --> 01:58:52,536
OK, now we start running again.

1042
01:58:53,101 --> 01:58:57,357
So embarrassed, he said, goodbye, lady, and turned around and walked away.

1043
01:58:57,660 --> 01:58:59,235
That's the morality I believe in.

1044
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:05,938
I'm not making the point, that's crucial, that this black policeman was deep in his heart a good person.

1045
01:59:06,121 --> 01:59:09,369
No, deep in his heart he was probably a shitty racist and so on.

1046
01:59:09,940 --> 01:59:12,797
But you know, superficial manners can do miracles.

1047
01:59:13,340 --> 01:59:19,214
You do this 10 times, and maybe your deep, deep heart will change a little bit.

1048
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:25,555
This is, for me, the greatest case of Mark Twain, I think, in Huck Finn.

1049
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:39,759
There is a legendary scene where I think that Huck or Tom Sarnon, who they help a runaway black slave, and then they feel morally bad for doing something.

1050
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:49,053
You know how what they did externally was right, but precisely their inner bad feeling is what is non-authentic.

1052
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:52,559
Like how they are not racist on the outside.

1053
01:59:52,721 --> 01:59:54,577
On the outside, they did a different thing.

1054
01:59:54,961 --> 01:59:57,677
On the inside, they are racist, which is why, again, I

1055
01:59:58,160 --> 02:00:00,935
believe in surfaces, in good manners.

1056
02:00:02,061 --> 02:00:03,295
I don't believe in that.

1057
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:05,707
I don't believe in really loving others.

1058
02:00:09,801 --> 02:00:14,419
I hate this idea of we should love other races, other nations.

1059
02:00:14,621 --> 02:00:16,077
No, we should hate them.

1060
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:20,659
We should just learn to pretend to act as if we care for them

1061
02:00:21,081 --> 02:00:24,557
and to be in this way to maintain appropriate distance and so on.

1062
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:27,737
I think that the most disgusting motto

1063
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:33,039
is this politically correct one, do we know others enough?

1064
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,677
We should get to know them.

1065
02:00:35,081 --> 02:00:36,739
No, I think people are boring.

1066
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:39,217
I don't want to know too many things about them.

1067
02:00:39,740 --> 02:00:43,619
It's quite enough to have a respectful distance.

1068
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:46,176
This idea, we should know the other.

1069
02:00:46,861 --> 02:00:49,518
How can we know the other when the others don't know themselves?

1070
02:00:49,660 --> 02:00:50,551
I mean, you know what I mean.

1071
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:53,522
I believe in superficial manners.

1072
02:01:04,810 --> 02:01:08,506
I saw that the applause was not to warn.

1073
02:01:09,391 --> 02:01:09,902
It's okay.

1074
02:01:10,270 --> 02:01:14,247
When we communists will take power, and you will learn how to do it.

1075
02:01:14,690 --> 02:01:16,148
OK, a bigger applause, please.

1076
02:01:16,311 --> 02:01:16,898
No, no.

1077
02:01:22,466 --> 02:01:23,409
Love is over.

1078
02:01:23,791 --> 02:01:24,355
I divorce you now.
