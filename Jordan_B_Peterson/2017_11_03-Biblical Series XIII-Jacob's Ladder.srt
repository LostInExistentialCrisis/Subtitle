1
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,233
Thank you very much.

2
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:36,566
Thank you very much for showing up again.

3
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:39,366
That's really good to see everybody here.

4
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:51,366
So, one of the things that I've been realizing as a consequence of going through these stories is that

5
00:00:51,466 --> 00:01:00,400
The degree to which they're about individuals is quite remarkable, and I think that's really telling.

6
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,200
Now, one of the reasons I prefer Dostoevsky to Tolstoy is because

7
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:10,400
Tolstoy is more of a sociologist, he's more interested in the relationship between groups of people.

8
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:14,333
This is an oversimplification because obviously Tolstoy is a great author, but

9
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:20,400
I like Dostoevsky better because he really delves into the souls of individuals, and I think it's remarkable

10
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:30,133
the degree to which all of the stories that we've covered so far in Genesis are about individuals.

11
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,733
And they're quite realistic, which is quite remarkable too.

12
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:42,266
They're not really romanticized to any great degree because all of the people that are regarded, let's say, as patriarchal or matriarchal figures in Genesis

13
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:49,666
have no shortage of ethical flaws and also no shortage of difficulties in their life.

14
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,366
And the difficulties are realistic.

15
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:59,400
They're major league problems, you know, like familial catastrophes, and famine, and war, and revenge, and hatred, and all those things.

16
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:06,366
It's not a pretty book, and that's one of the things that makes it great.

17
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:15,333
I mean, that's one of the things that characterizes great literature, right, is that it doesn't present you with a whitewashed view of humanity or of existence.

18
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,966
Existence and that's really a relief.

19
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:20,766
I think because as you all know because you're alive

20
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:30,700
There's no such thing as a whitewash existence like you're To be alive is to be in trouble ethically and existentially

21
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,033
I've been reading this book recently.

22
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:37,366
I'll talk about it a little bit later.

23
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,733
It's called better never to have been and

24
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,833
And it was written by a philosopher in South Africa in Cape town named Benatar.

25
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:46,833
That's his last name and

26
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,133
he basically argues

27
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,900
I Think it's a specious argument, and I think it's artificially constructed

28
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,433
But he basically argues that

29
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,800
Because life is so full of suffering

30
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,633
even good lives are very much full of suffering that

31
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:11,366
It's wrong to bring children into the world because the suffering outweighs the good even in good lives

32
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:17,066
and it's actually wrong it would also be better not to exist for exactly the same reason and

33
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,000
My sense in reading the book is that he came to that conclusion and then wrote the book to justify it

34
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:28,400
Which is actually the reverse of the way that you should write a book what you should do when you're writing a book is you?

35
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:32,133
Should have a question, and you should it should be a real question, right?

36
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,900
it should be one you don't know the answer to and

37
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,866
Then you should be studying and writing like mad and reading everything you can get your hands on

38
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,733
To see if you can actually grapple with the problem and come to some solution

39
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:49,166
And you should walk the reader as well through your process of thinking so that they can come to the well

40
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:54,400
Not necessarily to the same conclusion, but at least track what you're doing, and I don't think that's what he did

41
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:59,166
I think he wrote it backwards, but then and so I was thinking about it a lot because

42
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,266
Because, that's actually a question that I've contended with in my writing.

43
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,233
There are Mephistophelean, or satanic figures, for example, in Goethe's Faust.

44
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,600
And also Ivan, in the Brothers Karamazov, who basically make the same case, you know,

45
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:23,500
that existence is so rife with trouble, and suffering, that it would be better if it didn't exist at all.

46
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:27,600
And, the problem I've had with that, there's a variety of them,

47
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,566
But one of the problems I've had with that is, what happens if you start to think that way?

48
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:36,966
Because, what I've observed is that people who begin to think that way, that isn't where they stop.

49
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,166
Like, they get angry at existence, which is what happened to Cain, as we saw in the Cain and Abel story.

50
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,900
And then, the next step is to start taking revenge against existence, and that cascades until it's revenge against...

51
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,266
Well, I think the best way of thinking about it is revenge against God for the crime of being.

52
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,133
Which is, I think, the deepest sort of hatred that you can entertain.

53
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,066
And when you're in the grip of a really deep emotion like a really profound emotion right at the bottom of emotions

54
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:05,100
You're in something.

55
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,766
That's like a quasi religious state and that's more or less independent of your belief say in a transcendent deity

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,733
I mean you can be in a profoundly emotional state

57
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:20,466
That's as deep as it can be and it can have religious significance without that necessarily signifying anything about a transcendent being you know

58
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:21,366
but

59
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,266
But then I was thinking you see the problem with that argument is you can gerrymander it

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,233
endlessly, you know, because, first of all, how do you measure suffering and how do you measure happiness?

61
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,033
It's like, how do you assign weights to them?

62
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,866
There's just no way of doing that.

63
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,200
You have to do it arbitrarily.

64
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:44,100
And so, you can make an argument that the suffering outweighs the happiness, you just weight the suffering more heavily than you weight the happiness,

65
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:46,933
and that's the end of that, you know, and so that's, that's a problem.

66
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:57,266
But, I think there's a deeper problem, and I was reading this other book a while back as well, which was written by the guy

67
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:02,733
who ran the Human Genome Project, and I don't remember exactly what it was called,

68
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:06,766
but it was something like a scientist's case for God, or something like that.

69
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,200
And one of the things he referred to,

70
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:15,300
which didn't strike me as hard as it should have to begin with, was that he thought that one of the

71
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:23,900
Phenomena say that justified a belief in a transcendent being was something like the moral intuition of human beings that

72
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:31,133
we have a sense of right and wrong and you know it's certainly what happens in Genesis in the story of Adam and Eve is that

73
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:38,733
That that story announces the coming of the sense of right wrong right the knowledge of good and evil and it isn't something we ascribe

74
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,600
To animals it's something that's unique to human beings animals can be predators, and you know and they can be

75
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:53,833
gentle and you can have a relationship with them, but you never think of an evil cat or you know or an evil wolf even though they're you know they're predatory

76
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,533
but human beings we have this capacity to Judge between good and evil right and wrong

77
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:08,133
And it's really an integral part of our our being and I think you can make an evolutionary case for that a biological case

78
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:16,866
For that as you can make a biological case for most of what is is relevant about human beings because we're biological creatures, but

79
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,200
We don't really understand the significance of that like what happens in the story of Adam and Eve is that that's that

80
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,300
Realization that coming to the knowledge of good and evil is actually represented as a shift of cosmic significance, right?

81
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:33,200
it puts a it puts a permanent fracture in the structure of being and

82
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:41,133
You know if you think of human beings as insignificant Ants on a tiny dust mote in the middle of an infinite cosmos

83
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:50,466
a cosmos that cares less for us than who cares, fundamentally, if human beings have the knowledge to distinguish between good and evil.

84
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:55,466
But if you give consciousness a central role in being, and you can make a perfectly reasonable

85
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,533
case for that, because without consciousness there's no being, as far as anyone can determine,

86
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,400
so it may be much more central than we think, and I really don't think there's a counter-argument to that.

87
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,233
Like, not a solid one.

88
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:16,500
You can state that consciousness is epiphenomenal and that the world is fundamentally materialistic and it doesn't matter that there's consciousness.

89
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:20,033
You can state that, but you can make an equally credible case the other way.

90
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:26,100
And certainly our lived experience is that consciousness is crucial, obviously,

91
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:34,966
and we treat each other as if most of the time we're valuable conscious beings, and we wouldn't give up our consciousness, even though it's often consciousness of suffering.

92
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:42,933
And so then I think another problem with the book is that it's sort of predicated on the idea that life is for happiness.

93
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:47,466
And I don't think that's right, and I don't think that's how people experience life.

94
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:56,533
And I might be wrong, but it seems to me that people experience life as something like a series of crucial ethical decisions.

95
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,133
It's something like that.

96
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:11,233
I mean, I just can't imagine, maybe I'm being naive about this, but I can't imagine that, I can't imagine another being that's like me,

97
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:19,766
in most senses, that isn't constantly wrestling, in some sense, with what the next proper thing to do is.

98
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,300
It's not like it's obvious, it's not bloody obvious, and it doesn't mean you'll do the right thing.

99
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,966
Because you don't lot lots of times and you know that by your own judgment right because you're making mistakes all the time

100
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,600
Sometimes you don't know what you're doing and maybe it's a mistake and maybe it isn't and who's to say that isn't what I'm talking about

101
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,966
I'm talking about when you know that what you're doing is wrong

102
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,733
And you go ahead and do it anyways people do that all the time and that's also

103
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:46,033
Extremely peculiar you bloody well think that if you knew it was wrong

104
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:50,766
And you told yourself that it was wrong that that would be sufficient so that you just wouldn't do it

105
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:54,700
But that isn't what you're like at all you know and you can tell yourself something is wrong

106
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:04,466
50 times and you'll do it the 51st time and then you'll feel you know like like you deserve to feel probably and but it doesn't stop you and so

107
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:15,033
So then I think the other problem with the viewpoint the idea that the suffering of life Eradicates its utility is that it's predicated on the idea that happiness

108
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:25,233
Or lack of suffering even is is the right criteria by which to judge life, and I don't think that's how we Actually experience life.

109
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:31,533
I think what we do instead is put ourselves through a series of excruciating moral choices

110
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:41,533
You know and one of the things that that's really significant about the biblical stories, and I think about the the entire implicit

111
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:49,666
Philosophy you know that's embedded in the stories is that that's how life is presented in in the stories is all of these

112
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,100
Individuals first they're individuals not groups and second they're agonizing over their moral choices all the time all the time and they have a relationship with God and

113
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:12,166
But it's not it. It's not a directive relationship exactly even The people to whom God speaks directly which I suspect is not something you'd exactly want to have happen is

114
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,366
Even the fact that they have a direct relationship with God doesn't stop them from being tormented continually by their moral choices.

115
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:28,233
And so, the world is presented as a moral landscape.

116
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,466
Not as a place that justifies itself by happiness.

117
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:39,466
It's presented as a moral landscape, and people are presented as creatures who traverse through the moral landscape,

118
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:44,266
landscape, making ethical decisions that determine the course of the world.

119
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,733
And that seems to me to be right, and that's not the same as happiness, by any stretch of the imagination.

120
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:57,100
It's a whole different category of being, and, you know, and then I've thought that

121
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:06,566
through a lot, and I think, well, we do make choices, and what we do is contend with the future, you know, and that the future seems to appear to us as a realm of possibility.

122
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:15,566
a more accurate way of thinking about it than that the future presents itself to us as a realm of determined things.

123
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:20,433
It presents itself as a realm of possibility, and there's good choices in that realm, and

124
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:23,633
there's poor choices, or even evil choices in that realm.

125
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:29,800
And we're negotiating continually, deciding which of those choices we're going to bring into being.

126
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,100
That seems to me to be phenomenologically indisputable, and we certainly treat each

127
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:40,533
other as if that's what we're doing because we hold each other responsible for our actions you know with some exceptions and

128
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:50,766
that we're deciding each moment whether to make things better or worse and that seems to me to be correct and

129
00:12:51,966 --> 00:13:00,833
I think that that's what these stories illustrate they don't say that directly you know although I think it gets more and more explicit as the narrative unfolds

130
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,100
but and then part of the realism of the stories is that

131
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:11,433
The people aren't the people that are being presented are by no means good

132
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,366
I mean, maybe with the exception of Noah, Noah seemed to be a pretty good guy

133
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:22,633
well, he did get drunk and you know and and and end up naked exposed to his sons and so forth and but I mean

134
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:27,100
He isn't talked about a lot as a character.

135
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:33,400
It's a pretty compressed story, but Abraham I mean Abraham had plenty of problems not least of which was in his inability to leave home

136
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:39,900
And then you know he's lying about his wife, and there's all sorts of mistakes, and then Jacob who we're going to talk about tonight is

137
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:45,866
An even more morally ambivalent character.

138
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,933
He's especially at the beginning of the story.

139
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:48,033
He's

140
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:50,633
it's it's

141
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:55,266
He isn't the sort of person that you would pick out

142
00:13:56,633 --> 00:14:00,600
Especially if you were a hack writer you wouldn't pick him out as the hero of the story

143
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:07,200
He does a lot of things that are really pretty reprehensible and takes him an awful long time to learn better and yet

144
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,333
He's the person who's put forward as the father of the 12 tribes of Israel.

145
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:16,400
It's from this flawed person that the people that that

146
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:24,900
Maybe that whose story you might say is at the fundamental constitutes the fundamental underpinning of our culture.

147
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:29,866
It's from this deeply flawed individual that that group emerges.

148
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:39,733
And so you might think of that as a relief, too, because, you know, you're no knight in shining armor, you know, with a pure moral past.

149
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:44,633
I mean, people make mistakes of catastrophic proportions non-stop, you know.

150
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,900
And that also means that these stories put forward something approximating hope,

151
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:57,100
because in their realism, in their moral realism, they present heroes, I suppose,

152
00:14:57,266 --> 00:15:07,700
the heroes of renown, right, the patriarchs of old, let's say, who are realistic people who have fits of anger and rage and who are murderous at times

153
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:14,866
and who are deeply, deeply embroiled with family dispute and who have

154
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:19,833
adulterous affairs and, like, they do all the terrible things that people do

155
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:24,000
and the weird thing is is that God is still with them and

156
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:31,333
you know it isn't obvious what that means or even if it means anything, but

157
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:38,133
it's very it's not disputable as far as I can tell that a we're conscious and that

158
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,700
Consciousness is a transcendent phenomena Which which we do not understand and that the landscape that we traverse through is moral like every story you ever watch

159
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,433
Watch anything that grips your imagination on the screen or in the theater like any story that grabs

160
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,533
You is a story of moral striving.

161
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:56,700
It's just not interesting otherwise

162
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,700
Right the person has to be confronted with complex moral choices

163
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:05,800
And then you see the outcome and you know the good guy does it right and the bad guy does it badly and things don't

164
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:12,200
Go so well for the bad guy Generally, and if it's a bit more sophisticated the good and the bad are in the same individual

165
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,766
And that's you know that's a more compelling story

166
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:15,800
but

167
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:26,833
so we could say well that lets we could make the assumption that it might be worthwhile thinking of the world as a as

168
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:36,633
It has been thought of classically as a theater upon which the forces of good and evil continually strive for dominance and I

169
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:47,000
For the life of me especially after I started reading deeply into 20th century history and all the terrible things that happened in the 20th century and all the terrible unbelievably

170
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:55,400
Reprehensible things that people did to one another I just couldn't see seeing things any other way is realistic

171
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:06,200
you know because I don't think that you can immerse yourself in 20th century history without coming to the conclusion that evil is a reality and if it's a reality

172
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:11,100
It depends on what you mean by reality, but it's fundamental enough reality for me

173
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,633
and if it's a reality then I don't see how you can escape from the conclusion that

174
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:21,866
that the cosmos, as we experience it at least, is a place of moral striving.

175
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,466
And, well that's one of the things that's really illustrated in the story of Jacob, and I found that quite striking.

176
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:45,233
So, the last time, last lecture, I ended with the Abrahamic stories, with the death of Sarah, and that was Abraham's wife.

177
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,966
And so we're going to continue from from there remember Abraham had a son Isaac

178
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:59,000
And he was asked by God to sacrifice his son which we talked about in some depth

179
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:06,100
and I was attempting to make the case that you know the idea of sacrifice was one of humankind's great discoveries because

180
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,733
It meant the discovery of the future essentially

181
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:15,433
But it also meant the discovery that the future was something that you could make a bargain with and that you could give up something

182
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:22,066
now something impulsive some pleasure even a deep pleasure in the moment and you could strive and

183
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,666
Hypothetically you could make a covenant a bargain with the future and if your sacrifices were acceptable and that seemed to mean

184
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:37,500
Ethically acceptable you had to sacrifice the right thing that that vastly increased the probability that not only you would be successful

185
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:44,866
let's say but that your descendants would be too and I Don't think that that's an irrational proposition

186
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:48,400
I mean you have to leaving it a bit with the realization that sometimes

187
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:54,500
you know you get sliced off at the knees no matter what right because life has an arbitrary element and and

188
00:18:55,433 --> 00:19:01,700
that can't be tossed out but Building in the arbitrary element will say you still want to think well

189
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:08,500
What's your best bet given a certain amount of randomness and it seems to me that conscious self-aware

190
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:14,766
Sacrifice and proper ethical striving is your best bet and you know there's another idea

191
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:20,233
that I've always explained it when I've explained it to people I've always used

192
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:32,200
the movie Pinocchio as an example you know that when Geppetto was trying to make his puppet into a self-aware and autonomous moral agent which is

193
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,800
what he wants above all else you know he aims at the highest good that he can conceive

194
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:44,066
which is the star that he prays to essentially and hopes for the transformation and there's also something in that that's unutterably

195
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:50,433
Profound and maybe that is somewhat independent of the idea that you have to believe in God

196
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:58,500
I would also say that what it means to believe in God in the old testament is by no means clear and That's something. I also really want to talk about tonight.

197
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:11,066
It's not obvious what it means and well Geppetto what he does at least is Aim at the highest good of which he can conceive you know and that that's actually in a philosophical

198
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,900
definition of God upon occasion that God is the highest good of which you conceive and

199
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:28,166
You know that's different than The idea of a transcendent being precisely, but it's in line with it's in line with certain interesting psychoanalytic speculations

200
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:30,433
This is one of the things I really liked about Carl Jung.

201
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:32,733
You know Jung was so radical a thinker

202
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:35,300
It's just the young belief like I've read a lot of critics of you

203
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:43,333
And I've always I've always got a kick out of them because the things they accuse you of are so trivial compared to the things that Jung actually did.

204
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:47,200
That it's like accusing a murderer of jaywalking.

205
00:20:47,233 --> 00:20:50,000
Like, because Jung was unbelievably radical.

206
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,033
Like, here's one of his ideas, you know, he thought that it was necessary.

207
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:59,000
He believed that psychotherapy could be replaced by a supreme moral effort.

208
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,166
And so the moral effort would be something like aiming at the good and then trying to integrate yourself around that.

209
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:09,600
And that the good at which you aimed would be something

210
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:16,566
Approximating what you would be like if you manifested your full potential and that you'd have a glimmering of what that

211
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:23,866
Full potential was so that would be the potential future you and he thought of that he thought of people as four dimensional entities

212
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:31,000
Especially essentially that were stretched across time and that you as a totality across time including your potential

213
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:36,066
Manifested yourself also in the here and now and that part of what your potential

214
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,966
Manifested itself with something like the voice of conscious conscience or intuition.

215
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,833
It's amazing idea

216
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:47,933
it's an amazing idea right because it's like what you could be in the future beckons to you in the present and

217
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,300
Helps you determine the difference between good and evil.

218
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,133
It's a mind-boggling idea, and you know I think that

219
00:21:55,366 --> 00:22:06,633
It's an idea you have to contend with and then he went further than that and this is this is also remarkable idea you know he was interested in the symbolic representation

220
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:17,733
of Christ and I mean psychologically speaking and he thought of Christ as the representation of the ideal potential human it's something like that so it was

221
00:22:17,866 --> 00:22:26,333
a symbolic at minimum that's what Christ was is a symbolic representation of the ideal potential of a human being and so for Jung there was no difference between

222
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:33,800
there was no psychological difference between who you could be in the future beckoning to you and the prey in the present and

223
00:22:34,866 --> 00:22:39,700
orienting yourself in relationship to Christ psychologically those were the same thing and

224
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:45,700
Then so that's a pretty mind-boggling idea like seriously That's a mind-boggling idea

225
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:51,166
You know especially when you add the psychological idea that the one of the things that

226
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:58,766
Characterizes your ideal future self is the ability to make sacrifices right and the deeper the sacrifice the better and then also to recover

227
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:02,566
From the sacrifice right so that's the death and rebirth so the part of you

228
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:07,100
That's most essential to your full flowering as a as a being is

229
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:14,400
Your ability to let things go and then spring back from that so to die in some sense and to be reborn in

230
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:19,800
The service of a higher good and then well then the next part of that is that

231
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,533
The direction of the world depends on you doing that

232
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:29,333
So not only your own life, but your family's life and and because we're networked so intently together.

233
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:36,866
You know that the whole Panoply of humankind and maybe the structure of the of the cosmos, and you know you might think well

234
00:23:37,066 --> 00:23:40,000
No, but you know it's not so simple.

235
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,800
It's not so simple

236
00:23:42,766 --> 00:23:45,066
First of all one person can wreak an awful lot of havoc

237
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,966
There's absolutely no doubt about that and as we get more technologically powerful that becomes even more

238
00:23:50,966 --> 00:23:56,033
Relevant and important and and and crucial you know one of the things that young said was that we had to wake up

239
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:03,933
because we are too Technologically powerful to be as morally asleep as we are and that seems to me just to be self-evident.

240
00:24:03,966 --> 00:24:04,833
That's yeah for sure

241
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,500
That's true.

242
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,266
We're we're we're half asleep with nuclear bombs.

243
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,533
It's not a good idea.

244
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,033
It's seriously not a good idea and

245
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:12,966
so

246
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:24,733
Well, and then you might ask yourself too, you know, like, what is the ultimate potential of a fully developed human being?

247
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:31,366
And, well, we certainly know that you have admiration for people who are more developed rather than less developed.

248
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:37,566
That just happens automatically, or resentment, but that's okay, it's the same thing, it doesn't matter.

249
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:41,333
But it's not like you can't identify them, you can identify them, you know.

250
00:24:41,766 --> 00:24:45,866
And they're put forward to you in drama and fiction and all of that constantly.

251
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:48,400
So, that's another form of moral intuition.

252
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:51,866
You know, you can discern the wheat from the chaff, let's say.

253
00:24:52,966 --> 00:25:06,233
And so, the other thing that I was thinking about, that's worth consideration too, is that, you know...

254
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:10,533
Maybe this is petty, but I don't think it is.

255
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:14,766
Somebody asked me the other day if I believed in miracles.

256
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,200
And I hate being asked questions like that, you know.

257
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,300
and

258
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:25,600
You know it's also people ask me do I believe in God and like I don't know what they mean when they say that

259
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,966
And so I don't know what to answer because I don't think we're talked necessarily going to talk about the same thing

260
00:25:30,066 --> 00:25:35,700
But in any case I said yes, and I have a variety of reasons for that, but one of them is that you know

261
00:25:38,566 --> 00:25:49,233
the consensus among physicists is that But we can track the origin of the cosmos to something like a hundred millionth of a millionth of a second after the Big Bang.

262
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:55,700
It's like it's so close to the Big Bang that the difference is literally infinitesimal.

263
00:25:56,433 --> 00:26:02,166
But the consensus is that before that, whatever that is, the laws of physics themselves break down.

264
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:09,900
Well, what do you call an event that exists outside the laws of physics?

265
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,333
By definition, that's a miracle.

266
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,833
Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that there's a transcendent deity that caused the event.

267
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,000
That's a separate issue.

268
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:27,966
But it does imply a barrier of some sort, beyond which we can't go, where some other set of rules apply.

269
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:31,566
And so, I find that interesting as well.

270
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:32,833
so

271
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:37,666
All right

272
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:47,400
so Sarah dies and Abraham makes a bargain with the

273
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:55,500
Hittites to purchase a burial place for her and they offer it as a gift and he insists upon paying for it

274
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,500
It's a little story that basically indicates two things that Abraham was the kind of guy that

275
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,400
That you trust pretty much when you see him and that even if something is offered to him as a gift

276
00:27:06,533 --> 00:27:14,500
He's going to do everything to Be reciprocal about it, and so it's not a massively important part of the story

277
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:18,800
But it's it's in keeping with the same narrative flow and so

278
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:24,200
Ephron who's a Hittite offers a burial place as a gift and Abraham says no

279
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:29,333
You know you have to let me pay for it and Ephron says he will and that works out very well

280
00:27:29,766 --> 00:27:33,533
And so he has a good burial place for his wife and then

281
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:53,100
Abraham decides that Isaac needs a wife and so he sends his eldest servant to Mesopotamia to find a wife for Isaac and There's a strange ritual that's performed.

282
00:27:53,100 --> 00:28:02,100
So it says in the story that the servant places his hand under Abraham's thigh to to swear, but that isn't really what it means.

283
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:04,266
It means that he places his hand...

284
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,500
I don't know exactly how to say this properly.

285
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:09,333
Well, use your imagination.

286
00:28:09,366 --> 00:28:10,000
How about that?

287
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:16,266
And the idea is that, as far as I can tell, that he's swearing on the future.

288
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,633
He's swearing on future people.

289
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,866
It's something like that.

290
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,833
So that's sort of what testify means, right?

291
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,600
Think about the root.

292
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:23,400
Well, I'm not kidding.

293
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:25,066
I'm not kidding.

294
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,166
That is what it...

295
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:28,133
That is the derivation, right?

296
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:36,733
It is the derivation, so, so anyways, this is a serious issue, so that servant has to go and find Isaac a good wife,

297
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:49,666
and he wants him to find Isaac a wife who is willing to accept the same fundamental belief system, which is something like the belief in a god that's a unity rather than a plurality.

298
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:59,466
you know the other thing that young was very insistent upon was that there was a relationship between poly theism and

299
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,033
psychological confusion and monotheism and psychological unification

300
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:07,200
I really like that idea too that you know that

301
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:13,366
That what you're trying to do because you are a plurality that that's one of the things the psychoanalysts were really good at figuring out

302
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:19,200
That the cognitive scientists haven't touched yet as far as I can tell they're way behind the psychoanalysts in that element

303
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:25,400
thinking is that you are composed of sub-personalities, which all have their own desires and their

304
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:31,733
own viewpoint and their own thoughts and their own perceptions, and they're in a war with each other constantly.

305
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:37,966
Maybe even a Darwinian war, it's been portrayed that way by certain neuroscientists.

306
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:51,633
And that one of the goals of life is to integrate all of that plurality into a hierarchical ethical structure that has some canonical ethic at the pinnacle, right?

307
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:57,900
We've talked a little bit about that, and it's not obvious what should be at the pinnacle, but we can guess at it.

308
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,133
It's that which we admire.

309
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,433
That's one way of thinking about it.

310
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,266
It's that that describes fair play across a sequence of games.

311
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,866
That's another good way of thinking about it.

312
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,366
It's the heroic ideal.

313
00:30:10,366 --> 00:30:11,766
That's another way of thinking about it.

314
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:18,866
But it's it's combined with generosity you know because the hero the mythological hero goes out into the unknown and slays the dragon and gets the gold

315
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,366
But then comes back to the community and distributes.

316
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,366
What's found and so it's courage plus generosity and

317
00:30:27,266 --> 00:30:36,500
and so all of your all of that interior struggling that you're doing is an attempt to Bang yourself against the world with challenge

318
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:43,366
Constantly to hit everything together like you're beating on a piece of iron to to to to cure it

319
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,733
Let's say so that

320
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:48,033
You don't you're not an internal contradiction.

321
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:55,733
You're not a mass of competing gods something like that because it's just too psychologically stressful and hard on everyone else and

322
00:30:56,133 --> 00:31:01,400
impossible for them to get along with you if you're one thing one moment and another thing another moment and so

323
00:31:03,633 --> 00:31:11,566
So anyways, Abraham insists that Isaac find a wife from among people who are likely to carry forward the monotheistic tradition.

324
00:31:11,966 --> 00:31:18,966
And I'm not sure that the monotheistic tradition is actually indistinguishable from the individualistic tradition.

325
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,666
I think they might be the same thing at different levels of analysis, you know?

326
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,933
Because individual means undivided in some sense, right?

327
00:31:28,966 --> 00:31:41,133
to be an individual means to be one thing, and the other thing that mitigates against the idea of life as happiness is that it isn't obvious to me that it's happiness that is what molds you and shapes you.

328
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,233
It's something more like optimal challenge, voluntarily undertaken.

329
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,200
It's something like that.

330
00:31:46,733 --> 00:31:46,833
Right?

331
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:56,400
And I think that's echoed in the idea that everyone has a moral obligation to raise their cross, something like that, to accept the fact of their mortality voluntarily.

332
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,766
I believe that that's the case.

333
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,266
And I do actually think that that's a prerequisite to proper psychological development, because

334
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:09,266
if you're not willing to take your mortality on voluntarily, like if you're kicking and

335
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:16,233
fighting about it constantly, and you have every reason to, don't get me wrong, then you can't act forthrightly in the world.

336
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:25,866
You're going to be afraid, and when you're afraid, then you can't voluntarily take on a challenge, and then if you can't voluntarily take on a challenge, then you can't develop.

337
00:32:26,133 --> 00:32:34,800
So again the life seems to be something like if it's a proper life is the voluntarily voluntary taking on of great challenges and

338
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:39,033
Maybe that's better than happiness like it's certainly more noble.

339
00:32:39,066 --> 00:32:40,433
You know it's not a word

340
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:45,066
We use very much anymore the idea of nobility because we're so obsessed with happiness

341
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:48,966
But I think happiness is a like if it comes along man great.

342
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:55,200
You know wonderful don't Don't take it lightly or for granted, because it's fleeting.

343
00:32:55,833 --> 00:33:00,600
But the idea that that's what you should be for, in some sense, seems to me...

344
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,966
If that's what life is for, then maybe it shouldn't be.

345
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:04,800
Maybe that's correct.

346
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,866
Because that isn't what life is.

347
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:10,733
But it also doesn't... It isn't obvious to me that that's what life should be.

348
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:15,466
You know, I mean, if you really loved someone, like your son, let's say,

349
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:17,133
Would you say well?

350
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:19,400
I hope he has a happy life, or would you say I?

351
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,100
Hope he accomplishes great things

352
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,966
it seems to me that that's better the accomplishing of great things and

353
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:32,466
because that's admirable you know it's like a happy person is a happy person, but a

354
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,866
Noble person is an admirable person and and that's that's better man

355
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:40,366
And so maybe there are better things than happiness

356
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,033
And so you can't judge being on the basis of the ratio of suffering to pleasure something like that

357
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:49,266
It's and I don't think we do that.

358
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:54,233
I don't believe we do that I mean comedians are happy right, but everyone doesn't aspire to be a comedian

359
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:59,333
And you don't watch comedy all the time even though you laugh non-stop more or less if the comedians funny

360
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,033
You want to get your teeth into something it also seems to me that

361
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:04,966
This is one of the reasons.

362
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,866
I like the existential philosophy was that

363
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,700
You know the existentialists believed it's sort of an original sin idea

364
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:17,200
They believed that we came into the world with an ethical burden already laden upon us something like something like that

365
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:22,766
And that we had a felt sense that it was necessary for us to justify our being and if we didn't do that

366
00:34:22,933 --> 00:34:24,966
Then we weren't authentic to ourselves.

367
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:27,166
We weren't moving towards individuality.

368
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,633
We weren't sustaining the community

369
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,433
We weren't living properly and that and that that idea was deeply embedded in people as part of their

370
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:38,000
Ordinary experience and that also seems to me to be

371
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:42,800
accurate and you know I've dealt with lots of people say in my clinical practice and

372
00:34:44,966 --> 00:34:48,600
They don't really cut they are they will come and say I wish I wasn't so unhappy

373
00:34:49,566 --> 00:34:52,200
But they don't usually come and say I wish I was happier

374
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,300
And those things aren't the same and and then when when when you talk to people who are having trouble

375
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,366
you know they want to straighten things out and figure out how to do them right it's something like that and

376
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,133
And that's the primary, that's their primary goal.

377
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:25,866
So anyways, Abraham sends his eldest servant off to his, the place that God has granted him to find a wife.

378
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:33,566
And interestingly, the borders of the Promised Land are quite similar to the current borders of Israel.

379
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:38,766
And these are estimates, right, based on the biblical, and I mean that's not a fluke, obviously.

380
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:46,000
It's interesting to see the concordance between these ancient stories and the present-day world.

381
00:35:47,133 --> 00:35:49,500
So, I thought that was very interesting.

382
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,500
And it shows, once again, that the past...

383
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:54,133
You think the past is the past, but it's not.

384
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,466
It's still here.

385
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,366
It's embedded in the present, you know.

386
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,433
Just like the future, in some ways, is folded up inside the present, waiting to unfold.

387
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,166
The past is all folded up inside the present, too.

388
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:29,233
So anyways, the servant goes to the land that he's been charged to go to, and he's trying to figure out how in the world am I going to find a good wife for Isaac?

389
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,933
I mean, I don't know any of these people, and so he has this little dialogue that's presented in the form of a prayer, I suppose.

390
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,166
And he thinks, well I'm going to go to the place where you water, where people get water, and water the animals,

391
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:49,366
Because that's a place where everyone gathers so that's a good place to find someone and and it's it's not a place of fun

392
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:57,733
and lightness and relaxation and impulsivity it's a place of Life sustaining work, and then he thinks something like well

393
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:02,366
What would a decent girl do at a watering place?

394
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:11,200
and he thought well, maybe she would offer a stranger some water and also offer to water the camels

395
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:16,933
Because that would be brave to approach the stranger and then generous and then

396
00:37:17,466 --> 00:37:24,266
indicative of the willingness to make an effort and when you know that a Camel, I think he took ten camels.

397
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:30,766
There's quite a few camels anyways not just one and that a camel can drink 20 gallons of water and

398
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,266
Rebecca who was drawing water from the wet turns out to be Rebecca was drawing water from the well

399
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,266
Which is hard right because water is heavy and you have to lift it up

400
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:44,033
And it's ten camels and so that's like 200 gallons of water

401
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:49,333
so you know she has to put herself out a fair bit in order to make this stranger happy and so

402
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,933
That's what happens and then

403
00:37:55,366 --> 00:38:00,000
The servant has brought along gifts and that sort of thing and anyways to make a long story short

404
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:09,300
Rebecca agrees to come back to come back with the servant and marry Isaac and so

405
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:19,166
Then she has she gets pregnant and she has twins and this is an interesting thing the twins fight inside her she can tell

406
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:24,500
that that they're not getting along and this is an echo right it's an echo of Cain and Abel and

407
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:30,733
There's a mythological motif that the unions have called the hostile brothers the hostile brothers

408
00:38:30,866 --> 00:38:38,766
And you see them all the time Batman and the Joker are hostile brothers and Thor and Loki are hostile brothers and it's an unbelievably common Motif and

409
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,666
You know the ultimate hostile brothers are Christ and Satan so that's them

410
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:50,500
That's the archetypal representation of the hostile brothers right the ultimate good and the ultimate evil and so

411
00:38:51,633 --> 00:38:53,400
And so it's an echo of the cain and able story

412
00:38:54,500 --> 00:39:05,933
Although it's a little more complex I would say from a literary point of view because it isn't obvious Which of these brothers is cain and which of them is able they have parts of both in each of them?

413
00:39:06,566 --> 00:39:12,033
So Esau who turns out to be one of the brothers and Jacob who turns out to be the other both have their

414
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:21,166
Admiral Bull qualities and their faults anyways Esau comes is born first but Jacob has him by the heel and

415
00:39:22,066 --> 00:39:26,633
And so there was a fight within the womb to see who would emerge first now

416
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:35,566
That's relevant because the firstborn Had a special status well has a special status in many communities especially agricultural communities

417
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:39,033
And there's a reason all these people were more herds people

418
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,333
But if you divide your property equally among all your children then in like three generations

419
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:48,266
Everybody has one goat and everybody starves to death you know or the same thing happens with land

420
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:55,466
So one of the ways that that traditional communities solve that is they just give them almost everything to the firstborn and then

421
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,166
Everyone else knows well you go out and do whatever you can and it's kind of arbitrary and unfair

422
00:40:00,366 --> 00:40:07,100
But you know at least it's predictably arbitrary and unfair instead of doomed over four generations

423
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,766
you know so it actually mattered to be the firstborn and and God generally favors the firstborn and

424
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,066
And then you might think well, what is it about being born first?

425
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:24,366
that's so relevant apart from the cultural practice of a more generous inheritance, and I would say well the firstborn is

426
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,833
something like the model for the leader of the family right because the firstborn child should be if there's a number of siblings a

427
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,433
Should take care of the siblings at least to some degree, but also should be a role model for them

428
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,100
So it's like a natural position of leadership, but there's a psych

429
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:49,400
There's a psychologization of the idea of the firstborn in these stories, because God often passes over the firstborn in favor of a later-born child.

430
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:54,133
He seems to do that on the basis of moral character, essentially.

431
00:40:54,566 --> 00:41:00,133
And so there's this idea that, well, there's a natural proclivity towards leadership that's

432
00:41:00,233 --> 00:41:07,900
just a biological fact that would be associated with being a firstborn, but there's an element of characterological development that transcends that.

433
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:14,033
And so that it's more important to be spiritually a first-born, let's say, than to be biologically a first-born.

434
00:41:14,466 --> 00:41:19,800
And God recognizes that continually in these stories and inverts the natural order and

435
00:41:19,966 --> 00:41:25,766
favors a later-born who's done more work with regards to characterological development.

436
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,300
And that's also interesting, too.

437
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:30,466
You know, I've talked to lots of business people about leadership.

438
00:41:30,966 --> 00:41:34,133
And there's a literature on leadership, but it's not a good literature.

439
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:35,233
It's pretty shallow.

440
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:40,100
Because it's not that easy to define leadership and partly because there are different

441
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,833
You know you people have different temperaments and different temperaments can be leaders.

442
00:41:45,866 --> 00:41:47,600
They just do it in different ways now

443
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,733
There's something in common about being a leader though

444
00:41:49,866 --> 00:41:53,966
And I would say one is that if you're an actual leader you actually know where you're going

445
00:41:54,566 --> 00:41:57,366
Right because what are you gonna do lead people in circles?

446
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,166
It's like maybe they'll follow you, but you're not a leader

447
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:01,666
You're just a charlatan so you have to know where you're going

448
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:06,100
And then you have to be able to communicate that and then people have to trust you

449
00:42:06,366 --> 00:42:11,633
So you actually have to be honest because people aren't that stupid at least not for a long period of time and then

450
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:16,833
Where you're going has to have some value because otherwise why would anyone want to go along with you?

451
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:21,933
So and then you might say well, what what are the attributes then that make you a leader?

452
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:33,000
And I would say well, they're character illogical fundamentally, and this is not naive optimism or or or Casual moralizing it has nothing to do with that.

453
00:42:33,033 --> 00:42:40,433
You know we know for example that that conscientiousness, the personality trait, is a good predictor of long-term success in

454
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,766
most occupations, not all, but most, and that one of the things that's associated with

455
00:42:44,866 --> 00:42:52,366
conscientiousness is that people keep their word, they're trustworthy, and that's certainly one element of a leader, especially across any reasonable amount of time.

456
00:42:52,766 --> 00:42:54,233
You have to be able to trust the person.

457
00:42:54,566 --> 00:43:03,066
They can even be harsh, right, it doesn't matter, because you can see harsh leaders and kind leaders, but as long as they do what they say they will do, then you can follow

458
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:08,266
And you know that the future payoff is is is secure something like that

459
00:43:09,266 --> 00:43:15,166
So the idea that character logical development is more important to leadership than primogenitor.

460
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:19,633
I think that's the right word primogenesis anyways being a firstborn

461
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:26,833
That's a very crucial psychological realization that it's character logical development that makes you favored of God

462
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:33,600
You know and I do think we've forgotten this in many ways because there isn't a lot of emphasis in our

463
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,666
Education system on character illogical development, and that's very very surprising to me

464
00:43:38,766 --> 00:43:42,066
I think maybe it's partly because in our fractured society.

465
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:50,400
We can't agree on what constitutes a Reasonable character illogical goal, so we just throw up our hands and don't educate our kids

466
00:43:50,466 --> 00:43:59,433
kids to any degree at all, especially in schools, about what an admirable person is like, or even let them know that, well, maybe you should actually try to be one, you know?

467
00:43:59,566 --> 00:44:04,100
That that's actually the most important possible thing that you could learn, right?

468
00:44:10,866 --> 00:44:21,266
So and I also think, and I think this is laid out very thoroughly in the biblical stories as well, is that if there are enough people who are admirable, then things work.

469
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,500
And if there aren't, then things are terrible.

470
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,033
You get wiped out.

471
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:38,666
You remember, when Abraham is bargaining with God, with regards to Sodom and Gomorrah, he asks God to save the city if there's like 40 admirable people, right?

472
00:44:39,233 --> 00:44:40,000
Respectable.

473
00:44:40,233 --> 00:44:41,066
But let's say admirable, right?

474
00:44:41,266 --> 00:44:45,966
I don't want to say good, because good is being corrupted, in some sense, by casual usage.

475
00:44:46,933 --> 00:44:49,033
I mean admirable, noble people, right?

476
00:44:50,033 --> 00:44:55,533
I think Abraham bargains God down to like 10 if there's 10 of them in the city the city won't be destroyed

477
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,400
And that's not very many in the city

478
00:44:57,633 --> 00:44:59,300
So there's an interesting idea there

479
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:04,100
Which is that there there doesn't have to be that many people in a group who have their act together?

480
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:11,500
But zero is the wrong number, and if it's zero then then we're seriously in trouble and

481
00:45:12,466 --> 00:45:16,433
I think that goes along with the idea of the Pareto principle in economics, too

482
00:45:16,566 --> 00:45:21,400
which is that it's a small minority of people who do most of the productive work in any given domain, but

483
00:45:22,266 --> 00:45:30,433
so so a small number of Properly behaving people might have enough of an impact to keep everything moving and that might also that might actually be true

484
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,833
But it can't fall below some crucial level

485
00:45:33,466 --> 00:45:37,633
and I do think that we're in some danger of allowing it to fall below some crucial level because

486
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:45,566
Our society seems to be at war in some ways against the idea of the individual and individual character per se

487
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:54,800
and I think that's absolutely I Think that's absolutely catastrophic, and that's part of the reason that I'm doing these biblical lectures.

488
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,033
You know because I think that

489
00:45:57,233 --> 00:45:58,400
I've known for a long time

490
00:45:59,433 --> 00:46:04,266
That the moral presuppositions of a culture are instantiated in its stories

491
00:46:05,066 --> 00:46:07,333
They're not instantiated in its explicit philosophy

492
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:12,566
There might be a layer of explicit philosophy and of course there is in the west and a layer of explicit law

493
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:20,133
But underneath that there are stories, and there isn't anything under the stories except maybe Behavior you know and that's so implicit.

494
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:21,633
It doesn't even actually count

495
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:28,766
It's not a cognitive operation, and so this is the story these are the stories that are underneath our culture and so

496
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:32,300
There better be something to them.

497
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:34,366
That's what we hope and but more importantly

498
00:46:35,066 --> 00:46:39,766
Maybe we shouldn't toss them away without knowing what they mean because if we toss them away

499
00:46:40,033 --> 00:46:45,766
Then we are throwing everything that we depend on away as far as I can tell and we'll we will pay for it

500
00:46:46,266 --> 00:46:50,833
We'll pay for it individually because we'll be weak you know because if you're not firm in your convictions

501
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:58,033
Then someone else who's firm in their convictions can you're their puppet like instantly and then you're also the puppet of your own doubts

502
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:00,500
Right because unless you have convictions

503
00:47:01,433 --> 00:47:05,166
You're going to generate doubts like mad because everyone does and then the doubts win

504
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:10,700
And you'll be paralyzed because they'll be you know 50% of you moving forward and 50% of you frozen stiff

505
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,933
And that'll be enough just to lodge you in place and so

506
00:47:19,866 --> 00:47:26,300
Okay, so there's a Psychologization of the idea of leadership which is very important and then it's associated with the idea of character illogical development

507
00:47:26,366 --> 00:47:32,566
And it's associated with the idea of struggle not happiness, and it's also associated with this Abrahamic idea

508
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:38,300
which I really liked and which was something that's been very useful to me as a consequence of doing these lectures because

509
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,233
Remember at the beginning of the Abrahamic stories Abraham's like a stay-at-home guy, right?

510
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,033
He's like the guy who's 40 years old living in his in his in his mother's basement

511
00:47:47,466 --> 00:47:49,366
And God says like get the hell out of there.

512
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,933
You know get out in the world where you belong go do something

513
00:47:52,766 --> 00:47:58,033
Difficult because what you're doing isn't acceptable, and you know the first thing he does is go somewhere

514
00:47:58,066 --> 00:47:59,966
There's a terrible famine, and then he goes somewhere

515
00:48:00,033 --> 00:48:03,066
There's a tyranny so you know it's it's pretty funny.

516
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:09,400
He follows God's call, and it's not like sweetness and light and paradise Immediately, it's nothing like that.

517
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:12,066
It's it's instantaneous combat.

518
00:48:12,066 --> 00:48:22,400
You know of the most difficult kind so but but Abraham does in fact follow that impulse, and you know it's interesting too

519
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:27,900
I mean, I don't know here's another thing that made me a really an advocate of psychoanalytic thinking.

520
00:48:29,166 --> 00:48:33,366
It was the sort of thing that started to terrify me about what the human psyche was actually like.

521
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:40,266
I started to understand that not only were we like an amalgam of relatively autonomous sub-personalities,

522
00:48:40,433 --> 00:48:43,200
each of which had the possibility of gaining control,

523
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,400
but that we were also victim, you might say,

524
00:48:48,733 --> 00:48:54,300
or beneficiary of impulses that were beyond our conscious formulation or

525
00:48:55,333 --> 00:49:00,400
Or or understanding or capacity to resist so one here's this here's a funny story

526
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:04,333
So I was talking to one of my patreon people online this week

527
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,366
And he said he's a he was a committed atheist, and that's fine

528
00:49:08,566 --> 00:49:12,733
You know lots of atheists are very honest people and they're atheists because they don't know how to

529
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:20,166
Reconcile what they know with Traditional claims let's say and they're not willing to just mangle them together

530
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,700
You know and there might be cynicism all that associated with it as well

531
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:27,866
But he said he was he said he was entranced by these biblical lectures

532
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:35,333
you know which is pretty weird and he said if someone would have told him a year ago that he was going to like be Obsessed with the sequence of biblical lectures.

533
00:49:35,366 --> 00:49:37,100
He would have told them that they were mad and

534
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:47,033
So we had a bit of a discussion about that because this is an interesting thing you know and he mentioned this he said It was something like you don't choose your interests

535
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,733
They choose you and that's really worth thinking about too, man

536
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:56,400
Because you know it's really hard to get interested in something you're not interested in even if you know there's a good reason for it

537
00:49:56,633 --> 00:49:59,233
You know you're studying for an exam you find the material boring

538
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:06,800
Anything will be more interesting than than the studying even though you know that that's what you need to do you can't

539
00:50:07,066 --> 00:50:12,500
Voluntarily grab yourself by the scruff of the neck let's say and shake yourself and say sit down and concentrate

540
00:50:13,233 --> 00:50:20,300
Your mind will just go everywhere But then if you're interested in something and even if it's something you shouldn't be interested in because that happens all the time

541
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,166
Then it's like you're a laser focus man.

542
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:24,466
You can pay attention forever.

543
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,933
You can work until you're exhausted

544
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,433
You won't even notice it, and you remember everything.

545
00:50:28,433 --> 00:50:33,266
It's like okay, if you can't control your interest what does?

546
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,466
And man, I tell you you can think about that for a very long time.

547
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,266
So Jung talked about the spirit Mercurius

548
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,866
You know mercury is the winged messenger of the gods and and here's how he conceptualized it psychologically

549
00:50:45,966 --> 00:50:48,133
He thought this is what the ancient people

550
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:55,233
Who thought about mercury as the winged messenger of the gods we're trying to state psychologically you know your your interest flits around

551
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:59,833
It's like there's something that captures it and that moves your interest from place to place

552
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,133
You know like if you walk into a bookstore, you'll get interested in a particular book

553
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:08,333
It's as if the book grips you because you don't know why you're interested in that you might but often

554
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,866
You don't know why you're interested in that book

555
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:14,800
And you know your interest is flitting around and so that's mercury the thing that makes your interest

556
00:51:14,966 --> 00:51:18,033
flicker around is Mercury, the winged messenger of the gods.

557
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:25,266
And Mercury is the messenger of the gods because it's the things behind the scenes, psychologically, that are manipulating your attention.

558
00:51:25,966 --> 00:51:29,033
And for Jung, those were equivalent, in some sense, to the lost gods.

559
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:39,166
And so, for Jung, your interest was being manipulated behind the scenes by unseen forces that were associated with your characterological development across time.

560
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:41,000
That was the manifestation of the self.

561
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,733
So the self is this... the potential you, let's say.

562
00:51:46,366 --> 00:51:50,433
And the way it operates in the present is by gripping your interest and directing it somewhere.

563
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,366
And that's part of the instinct of self-realization.

564
00:51:54,033 --> 00:51:55,733
It's a mind-boggling idea, man.

565
00:51:55,733 --> 00:51:56,133
Really, it's...

566
00:51:56,966 --> 00:51:58,100
I think it's correct.

567
00:51:58,133 --> 00:51:59,600
I can't see how it can't be correct.

568
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:04,233
It doesn't mean I understand it completely, but it certainly seems phenomenologically correct, and...

569
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:10,100
I mean, the potential that you are has to manifest itself somehow, in the here and now.

570
00:52:10,666 --> 00:52:14,266
It has to and what better way than by directing your attention

571
00:52:14,466 --> 00:52:18,566
You know it's like it seems like this might be useful for you, or maybe you get attracted to this person

572
00:52:18,966 --> 00:52:21,400
Maybe you admire this person that happens with kids a lot

573
00:52:21,566 --> 00:52:27,633
They'll admire someone and then copy them and you can see that that's obviously part of their developmental progression, right?

574
00:52:27,766 --> 00:52:35,000
It's a form of hero worship, but kids are very imitative and they hero worship at the drop of a hat and so they're they're entranced by

575
00:52:35,133 --> 00:52:42,633
The the next stage of development and if they see someone who embodies that especially if it's in the zone of proximal development

576
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:44,633
It's it's some it's something they could achieve

577
00:52:45,466 --> 00:52:49,300
Stretching a bit they find someone who embodies that next stage of development

578
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,733
And then they start to imitate them and act like them well.

579
00:52:52,733 --> 00:52:54,333
We're adults are no different.

580
00:52:54,366 --> 00:52:54,966
We're no different

581
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,866
We're just we do it at a perhaps more abstract and sophisticated level so okay, so

582
00:53:01,933 --> 00:53:02,966
Jacob and Esau are are

583
00:53:05,066 --> 00:53:05,833
Hostile brothers.

584
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:09,400
They're they're like Cain and Abel except the mixture of Cain and Abel, and they're very different

585
00:53:10,866 --> 00:53:12,533
Esau was red and covered with hair.

586
00:53:12,533 --> 00:53:15,666
He was a hunter and a man of the field so he's like your basic chalk, right?

587
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,633
He's extroverted.

588
00:53:16,666 --> 00:53:17,266
He's outgoing.

589
00:53:17,266 --> 00:53:18,400
He's really tough.

590
00:53:18,433 --> 00:53:20,500
He's like extraordinarily masculine

591
00:53:20,766 --> 00:53:27,733
he hunts and he's a real favorite of his father and so and and Jacob isn't he's a dweller intense and

592
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,666
Yeah, right exactly

593
00:53:31,233 --> 00:53:36,766
Exactly exactly right and it says Isaac loved Esau, but Rebecca loved Jacob now

594
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,900
That's a problem right that that's a big problem

595
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:42,966
and that there's a freudian element to this is like this family is now divided because

596
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:50,000
One child is the favorite of the mother and that's Jacob and one child is the favorite of the father and so Jacob is kind

597
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:54,300
of a mother's boy, I guess to use in our rather archaic phrase and

598
00:53:54,700 --> 00:54:07,133
And, certainly not as admirable from his father's perspective as Esau, who's a tough guy who goes out with a bow and arrow and like, you know, wanders around in the plains and brings animals home, and he's tough.

599
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:07,900
He's a tough guy.

600
00:54:08,833 --> 00:54:24,000
So, and, but there's this discord in the family, because one parent prefers one child and the other parent prefers the other, and it's obvious from the story that the parents do not communicate about this, because they really take sides, and so there's a split in the family.

601
00:54:24,533 --> 00:54:30,533
And that's I think very realistic because one of the things that you do learn if you have a family and of course most of you do

602
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:38,900
but if you also think about families is that there's there's deep divisions within families very very frequently that no one will ever talk about and

603
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:46,933
or even think about often because it's too painful to think about you know and Freud himself said Freud was clearly his mother's favorite and

604
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:52,566
And the family sacrificed a lot, including some of the potential ambitions of the other children,

605
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:57,166
in order to kind of put Sigmund Freud up on a pedestal, and advance his education.

606
00:54:57,233 --> 00:54:58,000
And it worked!

607
00:54:58,033 --> 00:55:02,200
I mean, you know, he turned into a great man, but there was a cost to his siblings.

608
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,400
And Freud himself said that there was something about being the favourite of the mother,

609
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:11,466
that gave a person additional confidence throughout their life.

610
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:14,766
And, you know, there's something to be said about that.

611
00:55:14,866 --> 00:55:21,000
Even someone like Eric Erickson you know he noted that very interested in child development that first bonding with the mother

612
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:29,133
Was the was the place where trust was established maybe trust even in the goodness of existence was established and so anyways Jacob is

613
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:30,633
Rachel's favorite and

614
00:55:34,066 --> 00:55:35,300
Esau is Isaac's favorite

615
00:55:40,466 --> 00:55:42,933
now Esau Being extroverted.

616
00:55:42,966 --> 00:55:45,600
Let's say is also a bit impulsive and maybe he's not

617
00:55:46,633 --> 00:55:47,533
He's a man of action.

618
00:55:47,533 --> 00:55:48,900
He's not a forward thinker and

619
00:55:49,866 --> 00:55:53,800
but he's also doing hard work, and so you know he goes out and he's hunting and he's worn out and

620
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,433
he comes home, and he's faint with hunger and

621
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:00,266
Jacob is at home cooking.

622
00:56:00,266 --> 00:56:02,600
He's boiling up lentils red lentils and

623
00:56:03,366 --> 00:56:08,600
you know Esau comes in from the hunt and he's like half starved to death and he's sitting there and

624
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:11,800
and the aroma of these red lentils reaches them and

625
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:14,700
he's exhausted and and and

626
00:56:16,366 --> 00:56:21,666
He tells Jacob that he wants some of this stew and Jacob

627
00:56:22,966 --> 00:56:24,133
Who's being a pain in the neck?

628
00:56:24,366 --> 00:56:24,900
fundamentally

629
00:56:25,533 --> 00:56:26,900
They've basically says no

630
00:56:27,366 --> 00:56:32,933
there's a there's a teasing thing going on here and and won't give him any and and and there's

631
00:56:33,733 --> 00:56:39,466
You have to imagine this because it's not laid out explicitly in the story but there's some dispute about whether

632
00:56:40,466 --> 00:56:46,766
Esau gets to have lunch and Jacob finally says well, I'll give you some but you have to you have to give me your birthright and

633
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:53,066
You think Esau you think he must say something like you know well to hell with it

634
00:56:53,466 --> 00:56:53,966
Take it.

635
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,900
You know you son of a bitch take it.

636
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,233
Just give me some damn stew

637
00:56:58,533 --> 00:57:00,933
It's something like that, so that's what happens

638
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:04,900
But you know with these archaic people once you made a statement like that that was you were done

639
00:57:05,133 --> 00:57:17,466
That was it and so Esau sells his birthright and this turns out to be incredibly significant Benson who wrote biblical commentary said oh

640
00:57:18,866 --> 00:57:24,600
there's a bit of a twist to it so Esau eats the the red lentils and then from then on his name is red and

641
00:57:25,933 --> 00:57:27,700
You've got to use your imagination a bit.

642
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,300
I mean People are making fun of him right that's why they're calling him red

643
00:57:31,466 --> 00:57:37,500
I mean he's already red because we established that but no one was calling him red before this and so for the rest of his life

644
00:57:38,366 --> 00:57:43,933
You know every time he goes out amongst his friends and family they call him red and sort of snicker because he's the you know

645
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:50,633
Half famished idiot who sold his birthright for a bowl of lentils and so it's it's not it's not that funny

646
00:57:51,066 --> 00:57:56,633
Actually, and so Esau is not happy about this and and it actually turns out that this so what does it mean?

647
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,700
It means don't sell the future for the desires of the present and don't be casual about what you have

648
00:58:02,233 --> 00:58:09,133
And then there's an archetypal element to this too and Benson says various have been the opinions what this birthright was which Esau sold

649
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,633
But the most probable is that together with the right of sacrificing

650
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:18,233
So determining what should be sacrificed and when and being the priest of the family it

651
00:58:18,866 --> 00:58:25,233
included the peculiar blessing promised to the seed of Abraham that of being the progenitor of the Messiah and the

652
00:58:25,533 --> 00:58:29,300
and the error of the special promises of God respecting Christ's kingdom.

653
00:58:29,866 --> 00:58:35,333
It was at least typical of spiritual privileges, those of the firstborn, that are written in heaven.

654
00:58:37,166 --> 00:58:43,066
Well, that's a lot harsher than meets the eye to begin with.

655
00:58:43,233 --> 00:58:49,200
And so, there's a very interesting, deep moral story there, which is...

656
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:54,200
It's sort of, Esau does the opposite of a sacrifice.

657
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,300
It's the reverse, right?

658
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,366
He sacrifices the future for the present.

659
00:58:58,466 --> 00:59:02,300
And so the story basically says, the way it's laid out across stories,

660
00:59:02,566 --> 00:59:08,133
is that if you're the sort of person that sacrifices the future to the present,

661
00:59:08,466 --> 00:59:15,400
then that eradicates the possibility that you will bring the most noble being into existence.

662
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,333
That's what it means.

663
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:18,000
And you can again.

664
00:59:18,033 --> 00:59:21,466
This is the psychological significance of the biblical story

665
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:26,300
So that's a bad thing to do if you want to realize your potential.

666
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:28,400
Let's say you don't do reverse sacrifices

667
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:40,133
That's a very bad idea and so Esau really did himself in by being too attached to the present without a vision of the future so he's too in the moment you know and

668
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,233
And he pays a heavy price for it

669
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:47,866
I mean he's the first of all he loses his birthright and and his double inheritance

670
00:59:48,033 --> 00:59:50,833
So there's a practical consequence, and then there's a spiritual consequence

671
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:55,733
And then he's well he's been made a fool of by his brother Jacob means

672
00:59:56,966 --> 00:59:58,000
Supplanter by the way

673
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:05,333
That's what the name means and Jacob is always trying to usurp Esau as we see and so Jacob gets one over on him

674
01:00:05,433 --> 01:00:09,766
And you know that's not doesn't make an older brother happy when a younger brother gets something over on him

675
01:00:09,866 --> 01:00:13,966
That's for sure, and then he loses the opportunity to be the progenitor of the messiah

676
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:18,066
Which is like he probably didn't realize that precisely, but it seems to be you know.

677
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,266
It's kind of rough that so

678
01:00:23,466 --> 01:00:32,733
Then there's there's a statement in Matthew 16 26 for what is a man Profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for a soul

679
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:34,600
It's an echo of the same idea.

680
01:00:34,633 --> 01:00:35,366
You know when you think well

681
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:40,800
What is this idea of soul mean and it's not intellect and it said it's something like

682
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:44,066
It's something like consciousness allied with character

683
01:00:44,366 --> 01:00:48,800
I think and I think the reason that it's valued so much is that because you got to ask yourself

684
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,066
Well, what do you really have when it comes down to it?

685
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:53,600
So life is suffering let's say and you know you can

686
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:55,166
You can pile up

687
01:00:55,266 --> 01:01:01,233
Worldly goods and the God in the old testament doesn't seem to have anything against that really right the people who he favors

688
01:01:01,766 --> 01:01:07,466
seem to prosper quite nicely in the world, but they also have to make a choice between whether they're going to

689
01:01:08,033 --> 01:01:17,066
fundamentally sustain their character or whether they're going to prosper in the world when push comes to shove and the idea constantly is that really what you have in the world that

690
01:01:18,166 --> 01:01:24,000
allows you the best possible defense against the suffering that's intrinsic to being is your character.

691
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:24,933
That's what you have

692
01:01:25,666 --> 01:01:26,566
Period.

693
01:01:26,566 --> 01:01:29,733
And I don't think there is anything that's more psychologically true than that.

694
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,433
You know because everything else well first of all your relationships with others depend on your character

695
01:01:36,066 --> 01:01:38,400
And certainly this is part of the story of Noah's ark.

696
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,000
You know because his generations were perfect, so we had a very tight familial

697
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:48,733
Arrangement everyone trusted each other that's a big deal if you hit a rocky patch in your life, right?

698
01:01:49,266 --> 01:01:56,000
And it's character that it's character that determines that you know if you're generous and honest and all of those things and people know they can

699
01:01:56,066 --> 01:01:57,266
Rely on you assuming.

700
01:01:57,266 --> 01:01:58,366
They're not resentful.

701
01:01:58,366 --> 01:01:59,866
That's a whole different story.

702
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,666
Then they're going to come to your aid when when it's necessary

703
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,166
They're going to pull together with you

704
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:09,766
And you know when people are really after you for one reason or another and they're accusing you of all sorts of things

705
01:02:10,333 --> 01:02:15,000
And you're guilty because you you have a past that's laden with character logical errors

706
01:02:15,466 --> 01:02:20,733
then it's very easy for people to take you down because they'll poke until they hit a place where you're guilty and

707
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,966
Then you're done because you'll do yourself in with your own judgment and so

708
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:28,600
well, so Iso makes a very big mistake, and

709
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:41,333
there's a sacrificial idea here too, which is, you know, now and then you're going to be faced with a situation where it's something you really want, or your character.

710
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:43,200
Maybe you'll have to lie about something, you know, and

711
01:02:44,733 --> 01:02:46,266
you'll think, ah, what difference does it make?

712
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:47,466
You know, I'll lie about it.

713
01:02:48,666 --> 01:02:49,766
Jacob does this.

714
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,766
But the problem, there's a bunch of problems with that.

715
01:02:51,800 --> 01:03:00,433
One is that, that well now you know that you're the sort of person that will in fact deceive yourself about the nature of reality if Something shiny is dangled in front of you

716
01:03:00,933 --> 01:03:03,466
And that's not good because it undermines your faith in yourself

717
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:08,533
And when you're really in trouble they call that the dark night of the soul when you're really in trouble

718
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,433
That's what you've got you've got whether or not you can trust yourself

719
01:03:12,566 --> 01:03:15,700
And that's it you know when things are really harsh

720
01:03:16,133 --> 01:03:22,333
And so if you've betrayed yourself in that manner, then you weaken yourself under the worst possible circumstances

721
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,266
And that's just that's really not a good thing

722
01:03:25,466 --> 01:03:25,600
so

723
01:03:26,733 --> 01:03:28,233
This is very practical advice

724
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,633
It's not casual moralizing.

725
01:03:31,633 --> 01:03:33,833
There's very little casual moralizing in these stories

726
01:03:36,066 --> 01:03:40,133
In the next part of the story there's some parallels with Abraham, and that's built into the narrative.

727
01:03:40,133 --> 01:03:48,566
I think because Isaac is Abraham's descendant and so we have to keep the narrative echoing forward

728
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:54,133
otherwise it loses its its continuity and there's a famine in the land that

729
01:03:54,300 --> 01:04:00,400
Isaac's in and God tells him to stay the course anyways repeating the promise he

730
01:04:00,766 --> 01:04:05,833
he gave to Abraham although Isaac goes to Abimelech also telling the king

731
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:09,000
and people that Rebecca was his sister which is exactly what Abraham did when

732
01:04:09,066 --> 01:04:12,900
He went to egypt and so there's another echo there of the same the same

733
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:20,866
It's as if the story is being told for a second time essentially and that's supposed to remind you of the of the previous story

734
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:27,400
but they're careless the king sees that Rebecca and Isaac are intimate together and

735
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,600
Luckily he doesn't have them put to death

736
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:37,666
He just tells everybody in the kingdom that they're to be left hell alone, and then isaac prospers in that land just like

737
01:04:38,633 --> 01:04:41,600
Abraham did in Egypt until the Philistines asked him to leave.

738
01:04:41,633 --> 01:04:43,300
He's just getting too rich and powerful.

739
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:48,000
Things are going too well for him, so he's asked to he's asked to leave.

740
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,033
Now in the meantime Esau gets married, and this is a funny little story.

741
01:04:53,033 --> 01:04:56,000
He says he marries two women who give grief to Isaac and

742
01:04:56,066 --> 01:05:03,366
Rebekah, so they, whoever Esau marries, they're not popular with his, with their in-laws, not in the least.

743
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,566
That actually becomes relevant a little later because

744
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:10,266
They drive Rebecca quite mad so I get a kick out of that because that's very common.

745
01:05:10,266 --> 01:05:11,333
You know it's not easy to

746
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:16,666
Integrate new people into your family and and hope that that will go smoothly

747
01:05:16,866 --> 01:05:19,900
It's actually one of the real catastrophes in life right you have a kid

748
01:05:20,433 --> 01:05:22,600
Maybe you get along with them, and maybe you don't

749
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:27,433
but let's assume you do, but then they marry someone that you just don't like and

750
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,133
Or maybe you think is wrong for them.

751
01:05:30,166 --> 01:05:31,066
I mean that's really rough

752
01:05:31,366 --> 01:05:36,500
That's what are you going to do about that you know because you're you're basically screwed both ways

753
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:42,133
if you have the person you love around then you have to put up with this horrendous creature that they allied themselves with and if

754
01:05:42,666 --> 01:05:46,400
You if you get rid of them completely well, then you know you don't have your child anymore

755
01:05:46,733 --> 01:05:51,766
So it's very very difficult position, and so that's another example of the realism

756
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:56,266
I think of the stories now isaac who's hypothetically on his deathbed asks

757
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:02,733
Esau to hunt for venison because he likes venison and he's happy that his son is a hunter and Rebecca overhears this

758
01:06:03,933 --> 01:06:10,066
So she conspires with Jacob to to slaughter two small goats and

759
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:16,200
make his father some stew because he wants Esau to make him stew out of venison, but

760
01:06:16,866 --> 01:06:23,300
Rebecca who's being I would say let's say slightly deceitful or horribly lying that would be more accurate

761
01:06:24,866 --> 01:06:35,233
She conspires with Jacob so Jacob kills two little goats kids and boils up a stew and then he puts on some goat skins because Esau is a hairy character and and

762
01:06:36,233 --> 01:06:45,966
Rebecca dresses Isaac in Esau's clothing because Isaac can't see very well at this point and so then Jacob goes into his father with the stew and

763
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,033
he's trying to disguise his voice, but it doesn't work very well and

764
01:06:50,966 --> 01:06:56,100
And so Isaac asks him to come close and Jacob puts out his arm with the goatskin on it

765
01:06:56,266 --> 01:07:02,933
And and Isaac smells him too, and he smells like Esau and which maybe wasn't the best thing, but

766
01:07:04,566 --> 01:07:06,033
And feels like him and and so

767
01:07:07,033 --> 01:07:08,733
Because Isaac thinks he's on his deathbed

768
01:07:10,466 --> 01:07:12,466
he decides to deliver a blessing to

769
01:07:13,233 --> 01:07:15,533
hypothetically to Esau and so

770
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:23,133
But it's Jacob and so you that's a big deal too because the blessing is actually as I said before with these ancient people it

771
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:27,000
Appeared as though once you said something you didn't get to take it back

772
01:07:27,433 --> 01:07:31,333
You couldn't say well look you you deceived me, so it doesn't count

773
01:07:32,366 --> 01:07:34,833
it was like I did they weren't maybe as

774
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,966
Well weak might be one way of thinking about it

775
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,900
But another way is they weren't quite as attentive to

776
01:07:43,066 --> 01:07:47,166
Context you know because if I make you a deal, and then it turns out that you've betrayed me

777
01:07:47,266 --> 01:07:49,900
I may feel that the deal is no longer valid because

778
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:55,233
The assumption was you were being honest to begin with and that you know violates the whole spirit

779
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:59,266
But that isn't how these people thought they said once you promised man you promised and that was that

780
01:08:00,266 --> 01:08:03,300
so Isaac blesses Jacob he says

781
01:08:04,366 --> 01:08:08,066
Let God give you the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wine

782
01:08:08,533 --> 01:08:11,166
Let people serve you and nations bow down to you.

783
01:08:11,166 --> 01:08:11,933
Be lord over thy brethren."

784
01:08:12,966 --> 01:08:14,133
That's going to be rough on Esau.

785
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,400
Let thy mother's sons bow down to thee.

786
01:08:16,433 --> 01:08:20,166
Cursed be everyone that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.

787
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,833
And so there's a quite a remarkable painting of that.

788
01:08:24,833 --> 01:08:25,766
So there's Rebecca.

789
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:26,766
She's looking pretty old and

790
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:29,833
Isaac's looking pretty blind and

791
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:37,566
Jacob's taking directions from his mother and we might say he's perhaps a little old to be taking moral lessons from his mother especially given And how she's acting

792
01:08:37,566 --> 01:08:43,000
And how she's acting and so it's a pretty ugly scene all together especially that we also know that Jacob

793
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:52,766
Already tricked Esau out of his birthright and so now he's like taking the birthright and he's taken the blessing and so as I said that

794
01:08:54,133 --> 01:08:56,633
Jacob he turns out to be the father of Israel.

795
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,800
It's like he's a reprehensible character.

796
01:08:58,800 --> 01:08:59,666
These are major league

797
01:09:00,466 --> 01:09:02,800
Betrayals that he's engaging in it's not trivial.

798
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,133
He really

799
01:09:03,933 --> 01:09:04,300
really

800
01:09:05,166 --> 01:09:07,633
Pulls the rug out from under his brother, and you know you could say well

801
01:09:07,733 --> 01:09:12,733
Esau is not as awake as he might be you know he's kind of a wild man and fair enough

802
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:19,633
but it certainly seems to me that the Predominant moral error falls on Jacob's shoulders.

803
01:09:19,633 --> 01:09:21,633
It's very treacherous behavior what he's doing

804
01:09:23,066 --> 01:09:29,533
so then Esau shows up, and he's got a nice stag for his dad, and it's like a Little late for that

805
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:34,533
And he states that his brother was rightly named Jacob which means supplanter

806
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:41,666
Because he's been deceived twice and Isaac says Isaac answered he's asking fun.

807
01:09:41,666 --> 01:09:41,866
Yes.

808
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:44,900
I was asking fundamentally if there's anything at all left over for him and

809
01:09:46,066 --> 01:09:50,400
Isaac can't give him the same blessing because that's already been given so he has to think of something else and

810
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:55,933
Isaac says behold I've made him thy lord and all his brothers

811
01:09:56,066 --> 01:10:02,366
I've given to him for servants which includes you and with corn and wine if I sustained him and what shall I now do unto?

812
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:08,733
My son and Esau said unto his father have you even one blessing for me my father and blessed me also

813
01:10:09,633 --> 01:10:15,266
And Esau lifted up his voice and wept and you know we already know that Esau is a pretty tough guy by all appearances and

814
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:21,366
you know he's out there hunting on his own and camping and it's like he's no pushover and the fact that this reduces him to tears

815
01:10:21,633 --> 01:10:24,700
is an indication of the magnitude of the betrayal and

816
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:31,700
Isaac says behold thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from above and by thy sword thou

817
01:10:31,866 --> 01:10:36,800
Shall live and thou shalt serve your brother and it shall come to pass when you will have the dominion

818
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:43,700
And you'll break the yoke his yoke off from thy neck and Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him and

819
01:10:44,433 --> 01:10:50,000
Esau said in his heart the days of mourning for my father are at hand then I will slay my brother Jacob

820
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:56,500
So fundamentally you know if Isaac dies or when he dies then we'll mourn for him

821
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:01,100
And then Jacob better look the hell out because it's like it's it's serious

822
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:06,033
Death coming his way, and you know he's got a he's got a point

823
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:09,500
He's in Dante's inferno.

824
01:11:09,533 --> 01:11:12,433
I think I mentioned this at one point, so Dante's inferno.

825
01:11:12,466 --> 01:11:13,600
It's a very interesting story

826
01:11:13,766 --> 01:11:15,266
it's a descent into hell a and

827
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:22,433
It's actually one of the places that we sort of derive the popular conception of hell was partly based on Dante's on

828
01:11:22,933 --> 01:11:29,266
Dante's imagination on his work and what Dante was trying to do was to discover the hierarchical structure of evil

829
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:33,633
And you know you might think there's a hierarchical structure of good some things are better than other things

830
01:11:34,266 --> 01:11:41,933
But there's also a hierarchical structure of evil some evils are greater than other evils and he put betrayal in the in the in the lowest part of hell

831
01:11:42,633 --> 01:11:48,000
Right so if you were betraying people you were right beside Satan himself, and so and I think that's good

832
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,400
That's very smart.

833
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,066
Well Dante was a genius after all

834
01:11:52,866 --> 01:11:56,600
And I think the reason for that is that you see if someone trusts you

835
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,900
They're laying their vulnerability open to you now.

836
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:00,800
They might just be naive

837
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:07,300
Let's say and that's we won't think about that because you're just a child if you're naive you can still be betrayed

838
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:11,500
But if you're an adult and you trust it's often because you if you're an actual adult

839
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:17,266
It's you willingly open yourself up knowing that you could be hurt right because you're not naive anymore

840
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:20,666
so you decide to trust and you say I'll open myself up and

841
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:26,266
I know that I'm laying myself open to you if you choose to use that power

842
01:12:26,866 --> 01:12:31,600
And then that's a good thing to know, you know, if you've been hurt as a child, or hurt as a naive person, you might say,

843
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,033
well, why should I ever trust again?

844
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,466
Which is a really good question.

845
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:39,000
And the answer is, the reason you trust again once you're an adult is because you're courageous.

846
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,133
You're courageous.

847
01:12:41,166 --> 01:12:42,966
It's an act of courage to trust.

848
01:12:43,466 --> 01:12:51,833
And the reason it's useful is because, if you trust someone, you open the door to reciprocity and negotiation and cooperation.

849
01:12:52,466 --> 01:12:55,300
And you entice the best part of the person forward.

850
01:12:55,966 --> 01:12:57,766
And so it's a it's a courageous act

851
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:03,366
But then if you betray someone then what you've done is you've taken the best part of them

852
01:13:03,533 --> 01:13:10,733
Which is the part that will courageously trust you know with open eyes right and you've stuck a dagger in that and so you've

853
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:17,233
purposefully damaged the best part of them and so that's why it's such a egregious fault and and

854
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,266
It's often people don't recover from that sort of thing you if you betray someone badly enough

855
01:13:23,366 --> 01:13:27,533
You can you can damage them like you can give them post-traumatic stress disorder

856
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,566
If you really if you really put your mind to it

857
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:37,633
And you know that's not just a psychological disorder if you have post-traumatic stress disorder it produces permanent neurological alterations that make you more

858
01:13:38,566 --> 01:13:43,666
Neurotic more sensitive to negative emotion really for the rest of your life like you can you can recover

859
01:13:44,733 --> 01:13:54,833
From it to some degree, but stress will tend to reinstantiate the PTSD so you you hurt someone and it's not merely cycled not

860
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:05,366
not that psychological is merely but it's not merely psychological right it's it's fundamental physiological damage so anyways Jacob's smart enough to get out

861
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:16,133
of there and which is also not really a testament to his integrity right I mean he's done these terrible things at the behest of his mother because he wants

862
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:26,033
power and and he wants to get it without deserving it and then you know he finally goes too far and he hightails it out of there to his to another family

863
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:37,633
member to his mother's brother and so it's not exactly the world's most heroic story that's for sure and so now there's an interlude here and this is a

864
01:14:37,833 --> 01:14:48,066
really interesting interlude it's the story of Jacob's ladder so he's off to visit Laban, or Laban, who's his mother's brother.

865
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:51,466
And on the way, he has a sleep.

866
01:14:51,466 --> 01:14:54,000
And he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night,

867
01:14:54,733 --> 01:14:58,466
because the sun was set, and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows,

868
01:14:59,266 --> 01:15:04,833
which seems to indicate very bad planning on his part, and lay down in that place to sleep.

869
01:15:04,866 --> 01:15:13,000
And he dreamed, and beheld a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven, and beheld the angels of God ascending and descending on it.

870
01:15:13,033 --> 01:15:14,766
And behold, the Lord stood above it and said,

871
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,766
I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac.

872
01:15:18,766 --> 01:15:20,566
The land whereon thou liest, to thee

873
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,400
I will give it, and to thy seed."

874
01:15:24,066 --> 01:15:29,966
And so this story of Jacob's ladder has really possessed the imagination of the West.

875
01:15:29,966 --> 01:15:30,900
And then there's a reason for that.

876
01:15:31,266 --> 01:15:37,100
It's because it's an archetypal story, because the idea of a ladder that reaches to heaven is one of the oldest ideas of mankind.

877
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:44,066
So you find it widely distributed among the shamanic cultures for example, and it's a hallmark of psychedelic experience

878
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,866
That's another way of thinking about it.

879
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:54,600
Which is a very peculiar thing, so there's one Representation of the ladder you see God up at the top there Peeking out from the clouds now

880
01:15:55,533 --> 01:16:03,266
You know that's sort of where we get the idea That God is in in heaven and then heavens up in the sky and and that's an easy

881
01:16:04,033 --> 01:16:14,300
story to make fun of because you know we've gone up to the moon and there's no God there and and but but this this is not a reasonable way of conceptualizing

882
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,933
what these experiences are about these experiences what this is the opening up

883
01:16:20,033 --> 01:16:27,533
there that's more like an opening into an alternate dimension that's a better way of thinking about it it's beyond like from from the Judeo-Christian

884
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,633
perspective one of the things you have to understand is that God is beyond space and time.

885
01:16:31,666 --> 01:16:33,333
He's not in the universe.

886
01:16:33,333 --> 01:16:35,066
He's outside the universe in some manner.

887
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:48,066
And so, the idea that you have an experience of God and it's up isn't... the up is the best that the human imagination can do with what's essentially a form of extra-dimensional experience.

888
01:16:48,066 --> 01:16:50,500
Or that's the best way to conceptualize it.

889
01:16:50,533 --> 01:16:53,100
And these experiences aren't rare, you know.

890
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,466
They make up the core of the shamanic tradition.

891
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:59,266
And so, there's an intrusion of the ancient shamanic

892
01:16:59,333 --> 01:17:04,500
Tradition which is tens of thousands of years old into the biblical stories at this point now

893
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:12,533
Why Jacob had a essentially shamanic experience is very difficult to tell because we don't know what these old people were up to right?

894
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:20,800
and we don't know how much of the Archaic tradition Archaic religious tradition was still extant at that at that point in time

895
01:17:20,933 --> 01:17:23,800
But we certainly do know that our ancient forebears

896
01:17:25,033 --> 01:17:29,900
We're using psychedelic substances constantly like Amanita Muscaria mushrooms for example

897
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,933
Which were widely used in India before they became extinct

898
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:40,433
That's the theory anyways that seemed to be the basis of the chemical Soma which much has been written about and so

899
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:45,500
We hear of this as a dream or as a vision and perhaps that's what it was

900
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:51,366
but perhaps that wasn't what it was either and perhaps it was an experience that was induced by by

901
01:17:53,366 --> 01:17:58,900
by the same processes that shamanic people have always induced these experiences.

902
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,333
And so we're going to go through this a little bit.

903
01:18:01,266 --> 01:18:04,733
Anyways, there's a connection between heaven and earth that opens up.

904
01:18:05,166 --> 01:18:06,033
That's the vision.

905
01:18:08,533 --> 01:18:09,966
And there's messengers moving up and down.

906
01:18:10,266 --> 01:18:14,000
Now, one way you can conceptualize that is psychologically, as we already discussed,

907
01:18:14,433 --> 01:18:19,566
that there are forces within you that are active and alive,

908
01:18:20,166 --> 01:18:24,033
And you can think of them, in some sense, as messengers of the higher self.

909
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,933
And so you could think about this as an image of a psychological reality.

910
01:18:28,533 --> 01:18:28,700
But...

911
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,966
And so we can stick with that, but...

912
01:18:31,966 --> 01:18:32,166
But...

913
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,500
Here's some of the representations that have been made.

914
01:18:36,966 --> 01:18:38,433
I really like the one on the right.

915
01:18:39,366 --> 01:18:40,266
That's William Blake.

916
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:42,666
I like the helix idea.

917
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:44,166
And I don't think that that's...

918
01:18:45,066 --> 01:18:45,733
That's fluke.

919
01:18:45,766 --> 01:18:48,533
There are helixes and double helixes, and all sorts of imagery.

920
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:54,066
Very ancient and very modern that are associated with both healing and with this kind of vision

921
01:18:55,133 --> 01:19:04,933
So and you see it in the blake representation God is associated with well really with the sun and with light and and you see that on the left as well that

922
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:10,200
Wherever God is is where light is and so that's a very interesting idea as far as I'm concerned as well

923
01:19:11,433 --> 01:19:12,833
There's some other representations

924
01:19:17,133 --> 01:19:17,833
One by Chagall.

925
01:19:23,633 --> 01:19:31,033
So now there's this idea that there's the possibility of opening up a line of communication between the human psyche and the transcendent divine.

926
01:19:32,533 --> 01:19:42,733
And there's a great image of Christ as pantocritor, so creator of the world, that is one of the first mosaics, if I remember correctly, and I wish I remembered where it was, but I don't.

927
01:19:43,133 --> 01:19:44,533
But it's a very interesting image.

928
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,933
I'm having a carving of it made at the moment by a friend of mine, but

929
01:19:49,866 --> 01:19:58,300
You see Christ's face Portrayed in a medieval manner, and he's holding a book so it symbolizes the importance of the book

930
01:19:58,433 --> 01:20:03,466
you know as a means of transmitting wisdom and his face is very asymmetrical and

931
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:08,200
The eyes are different one side and the other and one half of the face

932
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:12,700
represents the human part and the other side of the face represents the divine part

933
01:20:12,866 --> 01:20:18,200
And you know I also think about that psychologically because I do think that that's

934
01:20:19,133 --> 01:20:22,766
The right way to conceptualize human beings is that there's an aspect of us

935
01:20:22,933 --> 01:20:26,100
That's mortal and human and limited, but there's an aspect of us

936
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:29,933
That's transcendent and divine as well, and it's latent in some sense

937
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:34,700
But there are times when it manifests itself, and this is not speculation

938
01:20:35,933 --> 01:20:39,133
Right this is like the oldest experience of human beings now

939
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:43,866
It's not necessarily an easy experience to have but it's reported everywhere

940
01:20:44,266 --> 01:20:50,033
And it can be reliably induced as we've discussed before by chemical means which and I don't know what that means exactly

941
01:20:50,466 --> 01:20:53,133
We've talked a little bit about psilocybin mushrooms for example

942
01:20:53,233 --> 01:21:00,166
And you could say that the mystical experiences that have been invoked in the newest experiments down at at Johns Hopkins are

943
01:21:01,233 --> 01:21:08,233
Derangements or forms of psychosis you know because they have some similarity to psycho-psychotic experiences although

944
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:15,000
So, psychotic people were given LSD in the 60s, and they always said that that was something different than what they were having.

945
01:21:15,433 --> 01:21:18,700
And if you give psychotic people amphetamines, you can make them worse.

946
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,633
So they're biochemically separate, and we know that.

947
01:21:22,233 --> 01:21:28,600
But also, the thing that's so interesting about the psilocybin experiences is that they reliably produce mystical experiences

948
01:21:28,733 --> 01:21:31,833
that the people rate as among the most important experiences of their life.

949
01:21:32,566 --> 01:21:38,366
And, among those who have the psychedelic experience, positive things happen to them.

950
01:21:38,766 --> 01:21:41,566
And so that kind of messes with the whole psychosis theory, right?

951
01:21:41,633 --> 01:21:42,633
Because, what are you gonna do?

952
01:21:42,666 --> 01:21:46,800
You're gonna claim that you give someone a pill, and they have a psychotic break, and then they're healthier.

953
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,233
It's like, no.

954
01:21:48,266 --> 01:21:49,833
That isn't how psychotic breaks work.

955
01:21:50,333 --> 01:21:51,800
You're not healthier after having one.

956
01:21:52,333 --> 01:21:55,700
You're, like, you're a broken egg, and it's not easy to put you back together.

957
01:21:56,500 --> 01:22:02,866
So, and we know that people all over the world have discovered every manner of psychedelic substance that you could possibly,

958
01:22:03,766 --> 01:22:08,866
well you imagine there's lots of hungry people wandering the earth for a long time and they ate every damn thing they could get their hands on.

959
01:22:09,433 --> 01:22:12,800
Now and then something very peculiar happened as a consequence.

960
01:22:13,733 --> 01:22:23,600
So, so I'm going to tell you a little bit about the shamanic tradition because it's associated with Jacob's ladder.

961
01:22:24,533 --> 01:22:33,166
Um, according to Iliada, Mercia Iliada, he was a great historian of religion, a compatriot of Jung's, and they influenced each other quite substantially.

962
01:22:33,533 --> 01:22:40,766
Iliada believed that shamanism that used psychedelics was a degeneration from the original, more pure shamanism,

963
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:53,366
but I think later scholarship has demonstrated that that's incorrect, that the shamanic ritual per se was a direct consequence of the use, discovery of, and ritualistic use of psychedelic substances.

964
01:22:53,433 --> 01:23:07,066
But anyways, Iliadah identified three pathways to shamanism, and the shaman in it, in a tribe, was more educated than the typical person, with a larger vocabulary.

965
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,266
And was the repository of the oral tradition.

966
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,466
And so, learned all the stories that had been passed down word-to-mouth.

967
01:23:15,633 --> 01:23:21,566
And people, by the way, are very, very, can very, very accurately tell the same story across generations.

968
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,200
That's been quite well-documented

969
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:29,000
So and and people who can't read really can remember because what else are they going to do?

970
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:34,933
Their memories are far greater than modern people's memories because we can forget everything because we can just look it up

971
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:40,266
but they remembered things because they had no choice my father knew someone who was a

972
01:23:41,233 --> 01:23:47,366
illiterate and and and and couldn't use numbers either when he grew up in Saskatchewan, you know

973
01:23:48,133 --> 01:23:53,966
Sixty years ago, and he was a he had sheep if I remember correctly and although he couldn't count

974
01:23:54,166 --> 01:23:57,166
He knew if one of his sheep was missing because he knew all the sheep

975
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:02,466
And so he could tell just by looking if one of the sheep was missing, but he couldn't count and so

976
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:08,133
Well, so people who don't have our particular set of skills first of all they're not stupid and second

977
01:24:08,233 --> 01:24:14,766
They have other skills that we don't understand to fill in the gaps so Eliade identified spontaneous vocation

978
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:19,900
So you were just you have the spirit of a shaman let's say so you're probably extremely high in openness

979
01:24:20,033 --> 01:24:23,066
Let's say from a modern perspective hereditary transmission

980
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:30,833
So you know your father was a shaman and your grandfather was a shaman and so forth and you got initiated into that process or a personal quest

981
01:24:33,233 --> 01:24:39,966
In Siberia this is from Eliana in Siberia the youth who is called to be a shaman attracts attention by his strange behavior

982
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:46,966
For example, he seeks solitude, becomes absent-minded, loves to roam in the woods or unfrequited places, has visions and sings in his sleep.

983
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:57,000
You know, if you put someone in a place that's deprived, that's where you're deprived from a sensory perspective, normal people will hallucinate quite quickly.

984
01:24:58,366 --> 01:25:05,000
So it seems what happens is that if you dampen down the sensory input, then you start to become aware of the background processes of your mind.

985
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:05,966
It's something like that.

986
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,266
It's like the signal to noise ratio.

987
01:25:08,266 --> 01:25:09,200
I got to get this right.

988
01:25:10,533 --> 01:25:19,833
As the noise decreases, some of the noise becomes signal, the background noise becomes signal, and you start to become aware of your own internal psychological processes.

989
01:25:19,866 --> 01:25:20,733
It's something like that.

990
01:25:21,466 --> 01:25:23,666
He has visions and sings in his sleep.

991
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:27,966
In some instances, this period of incubation is marked by quite serious symptoms among the Yakut.

992
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:34,233
The young man sometimes has fits of fury and easily loses consciousness, hides in the forest, feeds on the bark of trees,

993
01:25:34,733 --> 01:25:37,933
Throws himself into water and fire and cuts themselves with knives

994
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:45,300
We went to a potlatch in Northern on Northern Vancouver Island about a year ago

995
01:25:45,433 --> 01:25:48,166
And they had this one dance it was the Kwakwaka'wakw

996
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:53,066
natives and they had this interesting dance that was the dance of the wild man and so

997
01:25:53,966 --> 01:25:56,766
the person who invited us was the wild man, and he was dressed up in in

998
01:25:57,966 --> 01:26:01,733
Tree branches and so forth and so he was the person who'd been in the bush too long

999
01:26:01,833 --> 01:26:05,033
And he came in as a cannibal and there there was

1000
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:09,566
Genuine cannibalistic rights among these people not so long ago

1001
01:26:09,733 --> 01:26:14,966
He came in as a cannibal and everybody had to wear this like cedar headdress because if you had a cedar headdress on then

1002
01:26:15,366 --> 01:26:16,833
The cannibal wouldn't take a bite out of you

1003
01:26:16,933 --> 01:26:19,033
And they actually took this rather seriously

1004
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:23,266
So you should have your cedar headdress on and so he's looking around the crowd

1005
01:26:23,433 --> 01:26:26,833
And there's like 400 people in this place, and he could really act too

1006
01:26:27,033 --> 01:26:30,966
So he's doing this wild man dance and then all the women stood up and started to

1007
01:26:31,733 --> 01:26:37,366
Kind of dance in place and sing and they were taming him, so that was really cool

1008
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:42,733
You know it was really interesting to see that because those people are about they've had an unbroken culture for about 13,000 years

1009
01:26:43,566 --> 01:26:51,700
Say that's how long they've been out Island there, and it was very interesting to see that dramatization of the domestication of of man by women

1010
01:26:51,833 --> 01:26:54,266
Women laid out in that dance in that way

1011
01:26:54,900 --> 01:27:00,733
But it was also interesting in relationship to the shamanic tradition because he came in as a wild man right and he had to be

1012
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,833
re-civilized in some sense and brought back down to Earth

1013
01:27:06,166 --> 01:27:06,300
so

1014
01:27:07,433 --> 01:27:14,466
But by whatever method he may have been designated a shaman is recognized as such only after having received two methods of instruction

1015
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:21,300
The first is ecstatic dreams trances visions the other thing that this guy told me and I have no

1016
01:27:21,733 --> 01:27:22,533
There's no reason to doubt him.

1017
01:27:24,133 --> 01:27:25,700
He's also not a literate person.

1018
01:27:26,733 --> 01:27:27,700
And so has a great memory.

1019
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:29,666
He does carving, traditional carving.

1020
01:27:30,166 --> 01:27:31,200
And he's very good at it.

1021
01:27:31,733 --> 01:27:37,266
He carved a 53-foot totem pole that's now in front of the Museum of Art in downtown Montreal.

1022
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:39,333
So if you ever go there, you can go see it.

1023
01:27:39,966 --> 01:27:41,700
It won't be there forever, but it's there right now.

1024
01:27:43,033 --> 01:27:43,300
And, uh,

1025
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,666
he was taught to carve by his grandparents

1026
01:27:45,866 --> 01:27:46,466
and he said that

1027
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:54,433
he dreamed in, you know, you know what the Haida images look like, so the Kwakwaka'waks are kind of like the Haida, same sort of imagery.

1028
01:27:54,866 --> 01:28:00,133
He told me that he dreamed in those images, so when he dreams, that's the form that the

1029
01:28:00,766 --> 01:28:09,166
things he dreams about takes, and he also said that he would talk to his grandparents in his dreams, so if he was working on a piece of wood and trying to figure out how to carve it, and he

1030
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:17,233
ran into a particularly difficult problem, he'd dream, and he'd have a conversation with his grandparents, and they'd help him figure out how to solve the problem, and then he'd wake up and he could go carve the...

1031
01:28:17,633 --> 01:28:24,066
And the thing is he told me these things sort of matter-of-factly right like you know you know what I mean, it wasn't like

1032
01:28:25,066 --> 01:28:27,800
He was telling me these weird things that happened to him although.

1033
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,266
He was doing that to some degree.

1034
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:34,500
I asked him a lot of questions about what he carved and what it all meant and

1035
01:28:35,766 --> 01:28:38,033
You know that was just part of his explanation of how he did it

1036
01:28:38,166 --> 01:28:41,633
and he he carved me a couple of doors that I have in my house and

1037
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:44,600
And one of them is quite interesting.

1038
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,366
Well, the two make a panel and

1039
01:28:48,266 --> 01:28:50,200
They're an underwater scene and under the water

1040
01:28:50,366 --> 01:28:54,333
There's a bunch of you know mythical monsters some of them are killer whales

1041
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,800
And I think there's an octopus down there and carved in this particular style

1042
01:28:57,866 --> 01:29:03,100
And he said that the other thing that happens to him when he dreams is he goes down to the bottom of the water where?

1043
01:29:03,233 --> 01:29:09,266
These mythical creatures are and he gets inspiration from them, and so I thought that was extremely interesting, too

1044
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:14,333
You know we we don't know what a mind that isn't hyper civilized.

1045
01:29:14,333 --> 01:29:14,666
Let's say

1046
01:29:15,933 --> 01:29:20,166
Hyper literate like like our minds are because we're so bombarded by external stimuli

1047
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:25,866
We have no idea what the natural mind is like really and so it was quite interesting to

1048
01:29:26,833 --> 01:29:31,066
To to listen to that and and also to see the consequences because he's quite a great.

1049
01:29:31,066 --> 01:29:31,966
He's quite a great carver

1050
01:29:33,033 --> 01:29:40,166
So the first is ecstatic dreams transits visions the second is traditional shamanic techniques names and functions of the spirits

1051
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:48,433
mythology and genealogy of the clan a secret language this twofold teaching imparted by the spirits and the old master shamans constitutes initiation

1052
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:57,833
Well, so you know modern people have a problem with that because we don't really get initiated, but I would say that

1053
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:03,266
You know, let's say that we're each on a quest of some sort.

1054
01:30:03,666 --> 01:30:07,200
You wouldn't be here, I don't think, if you weren't, because why else would you be here?

1055
01:30:08,933 --> 01:30:13,500
And so you're on a quest of some sort to figure out, to struggle with the meaning of life,

1056
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:15,400
let's say.

1057
01:30:15,466 --> 01:30:20,933
And you don't want to do that alone, because you only last like 70 years, and good luck figuring it out on your own.

1058
01:30:21,433 --> 01:30:22,366
It's just not going to happen.

1059
01:30:22,466 --> 01:30:23,266
It's too complicated.

1060
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,366
And you'll be too isolated, right?

1061
01:30:25,833 --> 01:30:27,933
If it's just you, that's insanity.

1062
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:29,433
No one can stand that.

1063
01:30:29,933 --> 01:30:34,166
And so you hope that other people have things to tell you, and that your culture has something to tell you.

1064
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:39,433
You know, so you're on a quest, maybe not with the same intensity as a shamanic initiate,

1065
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:40,933
but you know, let's give you some credit.

1066
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:47,566
And then you're also trying to understand the wisdom of the past, and that's the second part of this.

1067
01:30:48,033 --> 01:30:50,500
It's like, okay, well you're a human being, and human beings have been telling stories

1068
01:30:50,633 --> 01:30:55,400
for a long period of time, trying to figure out what's going on, trying to figure out how to orient themselves in the world.

1069
01:30:55,500 --> 01:31:04,800
And so, you know, partly what you're doing here is exactly what the shamanic initiate does in the second part of the process, which is to expose yourself to the degree that you

1070
01:31:04,933 --> 01:31:12,100
can to names and functions of the spirits, mythology and genealogy of the clan, and the secret language.

1071
01:31:12,933 --> 01:31:17,800
This twofold teaching, imparted by the spirits and the old master shamans, constitutes initiation.

1072
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:20,600
So that's a rebirth, right?

1073
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:22,933
That's what initiation is.

1074
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:28,433
It's being born again, and that's a birth of the spirit rather than of the body.

1075
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:31,833
It's something like that, and so it's the rebirth of an integrated psyche.

1076
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:40,766
That's one way of thinking about it, and a psyche that's individual, but also grounded in common humanity, in the wisdom of common humanity.

1077
01:31:41,366 --> 01:31:45,566
And that makes you strong, or at least it makes you stronger, because there's a limit

1078
01:31:45,633 --> 01:31:49,500
to your strength, but God only knows to some degree what that limit is, you know.

1079
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,066
People can be unbelievably tough.

1080
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:53,633
Unbelievably tough.

1081
01:31:53,666 --> 01:31:59,800
And I think it's even the more admirable for human beings to be tough, because we're so conscious of how we can be hurt.

1082
01:32:00,433 --> 01:32:07,666
And we're so conscious of what that hurt can lead to, you know, you can have your family taken away from you, and you can be destroyed.

1083
01:32:07,866 --> 01:32:13,400
And the fact that you can be courageous in the face of that at all is something that is absolutely unbelievable, right?

1084
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:17,933
And people deserve a lot more credit, I think, than people give themselves.

1085
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:24,600
Because the fact that we can be honorable under conditions of life and death, right,

1086
01:32:24,666 --> 01:32:27,966
of suffering, that's a testament to the human spirit.

1087
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:34,766
And there's a profound anti-human ethos, I think, that pervades our culture, you know,

1088
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:38,800
that considers human beings cancers on the planet, something like that, you know.

1089
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:40,533
And that there should be less of us.

1090
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:46,300
It's the same spirit that motivated the guy who wrote the book about it better to have never been.

1091
01:32:47,066 --> 01:32:50,866
I don't see it that way, you know, I mean, I think people do pretty well for

1092
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:55,433
You know, for having their leg caught in a bear trap and their head caught in a vise

1093
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:59,700
They're actually doing pretty well because life is really hard and the fact that we're not

1094
01:33:00,233 --> 01:33:09,433
Absolutely brutal and murderous all the time is really something remarkable given what we actually have to contend with that we can go out of our way to be honest and generous and

1095
01:33:10,133 --> 01:33:18,766
Altruistic and to care for each other under unbelievably dire circumstances and to act nobly sometimes under the most trying conditions.

1096
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,066
You know, in Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago,

1097
01:33:21,166 --> 01:33:30,066
he tells story after story of people who acted abysmally, but also people who, under the worst threats imaginable, never sacrificed their character.

1098
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:32,100
You know, and reading about that is really...

1099
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:37,000
Well, it really makes you wonder.

1100
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:37,600
That's what it does.

1101
01:33:38,733 --> 01:33:44,100
The future shamans among the Tungus, as they approach maturity, go through a hysterical or a historoid crisis,

1102
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,933
but sometimes their vocation manifests itself at an earlier age.

1103
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:49,966
The boy runs away into the mountains and remains there for a week or more,

1104
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:52,766
feeding on animals which he tears to pieces with his teeth.

1105
01:33:54,700 --> 01:34:01,066
He returns to the village, filthy, blood-stained, and it's only after ten or more days that have passed that he begins to babble incoherent words.

1106
01:34:02,533 --> 01:34:06,066
The strange behaviour of future shamans has not failed to attract the attention of scholars,

1107
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:11,066
and from the middle of the past century, several attempts have been made to explain the phenomena as a mental disorder.

1108
01:34:11,966 --> 01:34:21,100
But the problem was wrongly put, for on the one hand it is not true that shamans always are or always have to be neuropathic, mentally deranged.

1109
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:28,100
On the other hand, and this is the critical issue, those among them who had been ill become shamans precisely because they had succeeded in becoming cured.

1110
01:34:29,233 --> 01:34:40,066
So it's not the descent into this strange subterranean psychological state that constitutes the transformation that makes the shaman, but it's the emergence back out of that.

1111
01:34:40,133 --> 01:34:43,500
out of that, and that's a journey to the underworld, and a rebirth, right?

1112
01:34:43,533 --> 01:34:45,300
And so, and there's this great book,

1113
01:34:45,833 --> 01:34:50,433
this is a great book, by a guy named Henry Ellen Berge, and he was an existential

1114
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:56,266
psychoanalyst and philosopher, and he wrote a book called The Discovery of the Unconscious, which I would highly recommend.

1115
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:58,333
It's on my list of recommended readings.

1116
01:34:58,366 --> 01:34:59,733
It is a great book.

1117
01:34:59,733 --> 01:35:02,800
If you want to know about the psychoanalytic tradition,

1118
01:35:04,433 --> 01:35:11,266
it's the best introduction there is, and he discusses Adler and young and freud and does a very credible job of all three

1119
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:19,333
but also takes the history of psychoanalytic thought back three or four hundred years before freud and so it's it's very engaging reading and and

1120
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:24,366
And and very interesting and one of the things alan Burge points out quite

1121
01:35:25,133 --> 01:35:36,866
Clearly is and he associates this to some degree with the shamanic tradition that both freud and young young in particular underwent very intense periods of psychological disturbance let's say.

1122
01:35:36,866 --> 01:35:46,766
And I would say what was happening is that because they were questioning their axioms at the most fundamental level, they were deranging their cognitive and perceptual structures, right?

1123
01:35:46,766 --> 01:35:52,800
And Jung was also experimenting with imaginative techniques, with visionary techniques, which he did a lot.

1124
01:35:52,833 --> 01:35:55,333
And there was a period of his life where he was

1125
01:35:55,433 --> 01:35:59,566
having a constant stream of visions, which he wrote down in a book

1126
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:03,266
called The Red Book, but at the same time he was still functioning as a

1127
01:36:03,433 --> 01:36:07,833
psychiatrist and operating normally in the world and so you know people have

1128
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:11,366
suggested that what he had was a psychotic break but that's ridiculous

1129
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:14,566
because you don't don't that's not how it works man if you're having a

1130
01:36:14,633 --> 01:36:18,333
psychotic break you you're not being an effective psychiatrist those things do

1131
01:36:18,433 --> 01:36:21,933
not go together especially not for a long period of time and so there there's

1132
01:36:22,333 --> 01:36:29,300
the possibility of extreme experience without psychosis psychopathology and so

1133
01:36:30,266 --> 01:36:30,433
and

1134
01:36:31,033 --> 01:36:39,166
Ellen Berge he says much the same thing about freud and about Charles Darwin as well who underwent a terrible period of Mental

1135
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:48,100
Confusion I would say as a consequence of Formulating his theory of evolution which was really hard on him because he was a he was a die-hard

1136
01:36:48,433 --> 01:36:54,466
Christian and he knew what he knew what the implications of his theory were he didn't know what to do about that you know

1137
01:36:54,633 --> 01:36:56,166
So it was very very hard on him

1138
01:36:56,266 --> 01:37:02,533
So it's quite common for people of genius to go through an intense crisis psychological crisis

1139
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:06,566
But then resolve it and the genius is in the resolution, right?

1140
01:37:06,866 --> 01:37:12,033
The precondition for the genius is the dissolution in some sense because you have to be obsessed with the problem

1141
01:37:12,066 --> 01:37:15,333
It has to grip you completely before you're going to concentrate on it

1142
01:37:15,433 --> 01:37:20,966
so obsessively that you might come up with a solution, but it's the people who come up with a solution that are the

1143
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:28,666
Prophets and the shaman and so forth and so on and and and so that's not this isn't something that only characterizes archaic cultures

1144
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:32,100
we just don't recognize it in our own culture properly and and

1145
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:33,600
That's a problem

1146
01:37:34,533 --> 01:37:35,433
Well sometimes we do

1147
01:37:37,533 --> 01:37:41,166
Right you remember that in the lion king right that Rafiki shows up.

1148
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:43,066
He's the shaman he brings he brings a

1149
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:48,466
Simba down that tunnel dark tunnel that's the dark night of the soul

1150
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:53,033
He has him reflect upon himself in a pool when he reflects upon himself deeply

1151
01:37:53,066 --> 01:37:59,600
He sees the reflection of his father then that becomes a core thing of cosmic significance and his father appears in the sky

1152
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:09,633
Just like God appears to Jacob and basically tells him that it's time for him to grow the hell up and to return to the Devastated Kingdom and to set it right

1153
01:38:10,633 --> 01:38:12,933
You know and so and that's right.

1154
01:38:12,966 --> 01:38:13,833
That's exactly right.

1155
01:38:13,833 --> 01:38:15,600
I mean we live in the devastated Kingdom

1156
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:21,866
That's an eternal truth, and it's the responsibility of the individual to grow the hell up and to set it right

1157
01:38:22,733 --> 01:38:27,566
because when it's devastated and when things are not in place then everyone suffers too much and

1158
01:38:28,366 --> 01:38:33,200
That's not good, and there's no excuse for not doing something about it because you don't have anything better to do

1159
01:38:34,333 --> 01:38:34,466
so

1160
01:38:36,033 --> 01:38:39,166
and even like children's movies tell you this so

1161
01:38:40,066 --> 01:38:44,433
So, this is a fun one.

1162
01:38:45,433 --> 01:38:48,600
This is from the Eadwine Salter, 9th to 12th century.

1163
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:57,166
That's Adam and Eve, but there is speculation that the fruit that they're eating there, you see, is psilocybin mushrooms.

1164
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:01,166
Because they're the only kind of mushroom that grow like that.

1165
01:39:02,466 --> 01:39:04,933
So that's pretty wild, you might say.

1166
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:10,533
And then, this is the, I think it's called Banisteria Vine, if I remember correctly,

1167
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:15,866
and it's what ayahuasca is made out of, and it has this double helix form, which is very, very interesting.

1168
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:24,366
And the natives, nobody could figure out how the hell they made this ayahuasca, which transports people spiritually in a very intense manner.

1169
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:29,100
And there's a whole religion based on it, like a modern religion as well as the archaic religion.

1170
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:33,866
To make this stuff, they had to take two plants that don't grow anywhere near each other,

1171
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:40,366
Like there's like a million plants in the Amazon so like how do you figure that out nobody knows then you have to cook them?

1172
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:45,566
In this very particular way for a particular amount of time before you produce this stuff

1173
01:39:45,666 --> 01:39:47,500
So one of the plants has DMT in it

1174
01:39:47,633 --> 01:39:53,366
Which is a very intense psychedelic, but it's very short acting and the other has an MAO inhibitor

1175
01:39:53,533 --> 01:39:56,100
So if you take the DMT and you take the MAO inhibitor

1176
01:39:56,533 --> 01:39:59,766
Then the DMT trip lasts for much longer and so that's what these

1177
01:40:00,266 --> 01:40:03,200
Amazonian natives figured out and no one has any idea how they managed it

1178
01:40:03,733 --> 01:40:06,733
And if you ask them they tell you that the plants told them how to do it

1179
01:40:07,033 --> 01:40:10,200
Which isn't much of an explanation as far as modern people are concerned

1180
01:40:10,366 --> 01:40:16,700
But then when modern people take the ayahuasca and the plant so to speak starts to talk to them

1181
01:40:17,033 --> 01:40:22,766
They're a little less leery of the whole theory that the plants had something to do with this, so you know and these things

1182
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:27,800
That these I'm loath to talk about this because I'm not an advocate for drug use

1183
01:40:28,433 --> 01:40:31,666
But by the same token you can't ignore empirical data.

1184
01:40:31,666 --> 01:40:32,500
It's not reasonable

1185
01:40:33,433 --> 01:40:40,000
And the empirical data that psychedelic substances can produce mystical experiences and that those often have a transformative effect

1186
01:40:40,133 --> 01:40:44,066
I mean one of the latest studies showed that if you took people who were dying of cancer

1187
01:40:44,233 --> 01:40:52,033
And you and you gave them psilocybin in a sufficient dose to produce a mystical experience that you radically it decreased their their fear of death

1188
01:40:53,133 --> 01:40:53,400
it's like

1189
01:40:54,866 --> 01:40:56,233
You got to think about that man.

1190
01:40:56,266 --> 01:40:56,400
That's

1191
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:56,500
that's

1192
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,866
Tough that's a tough experiment.

1193
01:40:59,866 --> 01:41:04,133
You just wouldn't expect that that you think you take someone you deranged them

1194
01:41:04,933 --> 01:41:09,933
Intensely and then when they come back, they're not even though they're dying They're not nearly as afraid of dying

1195
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:17,866
you know you got to kind of wake up and smell the roses when you see something like that and the people who are Doing this research are very reliable people so

1196
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:21,766
There's the Amanita muscaria.

1197
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:23,133
You know there's this old idea.

1198
01:41:23,133 --> 01:41:24,933
It's quite a funny idea toadstools, so

1199
01:41:24,933 --> 01:41:31,733
So, flies like Amanita muscaria, and there's some, this is ridiculous, there's some evidence

1200
01:41:31,866 --> 01:41:36,700
that they actually like getting stoned, so, because animals will eat these, like reindeer

1201
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:41,000
will eat these things too, and they get pretty tripped out by them, and so I have this book

1202
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:48,233
on psychedelic use among animals, which is a small book, but, and so, so there's this

1203
01:41:48,533 --> 01:41:54,533
idea that toads used to sit around the Amanita muscaria and wait for the stone flies to like

1204
01:41:54,866 --> 01:42:01,300
buzz badly around them and then snap them up, so that's pretty funny, I think, and so, and

1205
01:42:02,033 --> 01:42:08,733
you know, there are mushrooms in the US that are the oldest, the oldest organisms on the planet, hey, there's one mushroom

1206
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:14,700
I can't remember where it is, but it covers something like, oh God, I don't know, like square, hundreds of square miles

1207
01:42:14,966 --> 01:42:19,933
it's like this huge thing, because it's all underground, right, and they have these very complex networks of

1208
01:42:21,133 --> 01:42:26,266
Mycelia they're called and they think the thing is like a hundred and fifty thousand years old something like that, so

1209
01:42:27,233 --> 01:42:30,533
There's plenty of things about the world that we don't know that's for sure

1210
01:42:32,133 --> 01:42:37,400
There's the chemical makeup of the classic psychedelics you see they all have the same fundamental structure

1211
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:38,866
This is serotonin.

1212
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:41,433
That's the one of the major brain neurotransmitters

1213
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:53,433
and so what happens with the psychedelics is that they they alter the they alter the brain function by altering the the neurochemical utilization of serotonin

1214
01:42:53,633 --> 01:42:56,333
and change the manner in which the serotonergic systems work

1215
01:42:56,533 --> 01:42:59,733
and the serotonergic system is a very basic system

1216
01:42:59,766 --> 01:43:02,466
because when you're an embryo and your brain is developing

1217
01:43:02,533 --> 01:43:06,700
it's the serotonin projections that basically orchestrate the development of your brain

1218
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:10,766
so they're, and they're very archaic circuits, very, very archaic circuits

1219
01:43:11,466 --> 01:43:11,600
so

1220
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,633
and this is the paper, I think I stole this from Psilocybin Griffiths who's been doing a lot of this research psilocybin can occasion mystical type experiences having substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance

1221
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:25,833
Psilocybin Griffiths who's been doing a lot of this research psilocybin can occasion mystical type experiences having substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance

1222
01:43:26,966 --> 01:43:27,100
so

1223
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:28,566
Why?

1224
01:43:30,233 --> 01:43:33,533
That's a good question right like so so here's a question for you

1225
01:43:33,933 --> 01:43:37,333
It is beyond dispute that human beings are capable of religious experience

1226
01:43:38,933 --> 01:43:39,133
Why?

1227
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:44,366
Why is that exactly and they're like you can associate with psychosis?

1228
01:43:44,733 --> 01:43:48,866
But that doesn't work because the theory doesn't hold the theory doesn't hold water.

1229
01:43:48,866 --> 01:43:49,666
It's not the same thing

1230
01:43:50,633 --> 01:43:52,166
So why is it there exactly?

1231
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:56,566
And it's not an easy thing to figure out like I've been trying to figure

1232
01:43:56,766 --> 01:43:59,600
I'm always trying to figure out a biological explanation for everything right because

1233
01:44:00,233 --> 01:44:03,833
If you want to find something to stand on you want to make sure that it can resist a challenge

1234
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:10,133
And so if I can find an explanation for something that's reductionistic and materialistic and biological then I'm going for that

1235
01:44:10,733 --> 01:44:11,433
That's a tough one

1236
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,600
Consciousness is a tough one the moral sense is a tough one.

1237
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:18,300
They're not easy things to crack the big bang is a tough one

1238
01:44:19,366 --> 01:44:19,500
so

1239
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,833
You know I mean a cynic might say that maybe

1240
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:34,666
Sometimes when people are close to suicide they'll have a mystical experience you know and you maybe you say well

1241
01:44:34,766 --> 01:44:44,000
It's a last-Ditch attempt of your brain to delude you into thinking that your life has some significance significance you know and that's a plausible theory,

1242
01:44:45,233 --> 01:44:48,233
but I Don't think it accounts for the generality of the phenomena

1243
01:44:49,266 --> 01:44:49,400
so

1244
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:52,200
So I don't buy it

1245
01:44:57,033 --> 01:44:58,133
What happens in the shamanic?

1246
01:45:00,433 --> 01:45:05,633
Experiences that the shaman has the experience of being reduced to a skeleton first

1247
01:45:05,666 --> 01:45:12,666
so death, a death experience, a very realistic death experience, and then the next thing that happens is that

1248
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:18,933
he finds himself in a place where he's communing with his ancestral, the ancestral spirits, and

1249
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:33,300
then after that there's the climbing of something like the ladder, Jacob's ladder say, and an encounter with God for all intents and purposes, and it's very widespread

1250
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:43,400
It's the world tree, and I've thought about this a lot, trying to figure out what this represents.

1251
01:45:43,833 --> 01:45:50,100
According to a Yakut informant that's in Siberia, the spirits carry the future shaman to hell and shut him in a house for three years.

1252
01:45:50,633 --> 01:45:52,066
Here he undergoes his initiation.

1253
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:56,533
The spirits cut off his head, which they set off to one side, for the novice must watch

1254
01:45:56,666 --> 01:46:02,433
his own dismemberment with his own eyes, dissolution to the primary elements in some sense, and

1255
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:06,333
hack his body to bits which are later distributed among the spirits of various sicknesses.

1256
01:46:07,133 --> 01:46:10,366
It's only on this condition that the future shaman will obtain the power of healing.

1257
01:46:10,900 --> 01:46:14,933
His bones are then covered with new flesh and in some case he is also given new blood.

1258
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:18,966
So there's a death and resurrection experience that's associated with the shamanic ritual.

1259
01:46:24,066 --> 01:46:27,800
We're here in the presence of a very ancient religious idea which belongs to the hunter culture.

1260
01:46:28,733 --> 01:46:32,766
symbolizes the final root of animal life, the mold from which the flesh continually rises.

1261
01:46:34,166 --> 01:46:36,700
It is from the bone that men and animals are reborn for a time.

1262
01:46:36,833 --> 01:46:44,533
They maintain themselves in an existence of the flesh, then they die, and their life is reduced to the essence concentrated in the skeleton from which they will be born again."

1263
01:46:49,366 --> 01:46:51,800
That's a good graphic representation of the experience.

1264
01:46:55,066 --> 01:46:58,366
That's an old painting by I think it's Hieronymus Bosch if I remember correctly

1265
01:46:59,133 --> 01:47:05,466
I really like that because it's it's reminiscent of the near-death experiences that you hear people describe, and they're quite common as well and and

1266
01:47:06,233 --> 01:47:11,933
I Had that very weird experience once I don't think I've told you this story.

1267
01:47:11,933 --> 01:47:17,333
I was I Was assessing someone who had gone through a car windshield, and he was very depressed

1268
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:23,000
It had happened a long time before but he was very depressed and the insurance company was basically accusing him of

1269
01:47:24,066 --> 01:47:28,166
Malingering because he'd been depressed for so long and you know he'd sort of healed up and everything

1270
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:32,033
But if your left hemisphere is damaged especially the frontal part of your left hemisphere

1271
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:35,400
Then you can be in a chronic state of depression because the left hemisphere

1272
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:39,266
Generally speaking is responsible for positive emotion

1273
01:47:39,333 --> 01:47:42,066
And so if it isn't there then it's like negative emotion for you

1274
01:47:42,833 --> 01:47:45,400
And so I went and assessed him, and I was giving him this

1275
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:56,766
I think it was called the MMPI, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, which is a kind of a standard half personality test, half psychopathology test and

1276
01:47:58,433 --> 01:47:59,433
He was filling it out.

1277
01:47:59,466 --> 01:48:01,733
He was a very serious guy, middle-aged guy.

1278
01:48:01,766 --> 01:48:04,666
Nothing about him was New Agey in the least

1279
01:48:04,866 --> 01:48:06,066
He was like an accountant.

1280
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:07,266
I think I think in fact.

1281
01:48:07,266 --> 01:48:08,633
He was an accountant if I remember correctly

1282
01:48:09,733 --> 01:48:09,866
and

1283
01:48:11,133 --> 01:48:15,900
There's one question, and it said my spirit has left my body I

1284
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:17,833
Think that's right.

1285
01:48:17,833 --> 01:48:22,300
It's very close and he stopped and he asked me well.

1286
01:48:22,333 --> 01:48:23,966
He said I'm not sure how to answer this and

1287
01:48:25,533 --> 01:48:28,766
So I said well why and he said well after I went through the car windshield

1288
01:48:28,933 --> 01:48:33,000
I was in a coma for three weeks something like that, and I died.

1289
01:48:33,033 --> 01:48:34,833
I think he said he died three times and

1290
01:48:35,833 --> 01:48:37,366
He said that he could remember

1291
01:48:38,633 --> 01:48:41,900
He couldn't remember anything during that period of time, and he couldn't remember the car accident.

1292
01:48:41,933 --> 01:48:42,900
That's retrograde amnesia

1293
01:48:43,033 --> 01:48:47,266
It's quite common with head injuries, and he said that during one of those

1294
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:53,833
experiences, and this is all he remembered from the hospital, was that he came out of his body and

1295
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:59,833
went down the long tunnel of light, you've heard these near-death experiences, and then saw his family members there and

1296
01:49:00,733 --> 01:49:05,733
Saw the heavenly light and then realized that it wasn't his time and came back to his body

1297
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:12,166
Now what was interesting about this guy was that well first of all I didn't ask him about this right

1298
01:49:12,366 --> 01:49:18,333
He basically volunteered this story, and it was instigated by this question and and

1299
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:25,933
He didn't know that anybody else had any ever had an experience like that because I asked him if he'd ever heard anything about like

1300
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:31,633
That he said no that was interesting, but what really was interesting is how the hell did he remember that?

1301
01:49:33,066 --> 01:49:36,033
Right, because he had amnesia during that entire period of time.

1302
01:49:36,066 --> 01:49:36,900
He was in a bloody coma.

1303
01:49:37,366 --> 01:49:39,433
It's like he didn't remember anything.

1304
01:49:39,466 --> 01:49:40,200
He remembered that.

1305
01:49:41,366 --> 01:49:41,633
And so,

1306
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:47,000
well, those experiences are more common than you think.

1307
01:49:47,033 --> 01:49:48,800
And then there's a, you know, there's a painting of one

1308
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,300
which is quite interesting, and that's like a tunnel to heaven.

1309
01:49:52,333 --> 01:49:53,366
It's the same basic idea.

1310
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:58,366
It's a little bit more suffering going on in this one, I think, but that's pretty much typical of Hieronymus Bosch.

1311
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:00,366
I mean, I don't know what was up with that guy, but

1312
01:50:01,333 --> 01:50:06,933
he was he was one strange character now the scandinavians have this idea that

1313
01:50:07,466 --> 01:50:12,833
the world is a tree and I've been thinking about that a lot I think that

1314
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:19,533
the tree idea the tree is something that is grounded in in matter let's say and

1315
01:50:19,566 --> 01:50:22,666
that reaches up to heaven in the Scandinavian tree at the bottom there's

1316
01:50:22,733 --> 01:50:26,666
quite a cool idea at the bottom of that see this tree is constantly being nod by

1317
01:50:26,866 --> 01:50:30,533
Snakes you can sort of see the snakes at the bottom and at the same time

1318
01:50:30,633 --> 01:50:35,333
It's being watered and the water makes the tree grow at the same rate that the snakes gnawed its roots

1319
01:50:35,900 --> 01:50:37,300
So it's like a yin-yang idea

1320
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:43,066
You know that there's continual chaotic destruction and replacement at the basis of whatever this process is

1321
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:46,433
but the tree seems to me to be a representation not so much of

1322
01:50:47,333 --> 01:50:50,100
It's like a different dimensional space.

1323
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:54,600
That's that's what's trying to be represented so imagine that you know you're structured

1324
01:50:55,700 --> 01:51:02,633
If you take powers of 10 magnification, say human beings are about in the middle of the tiniest thing and the largest thing

1325
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:04,566
If you do it by powers of 10

1326
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:09,633
And so, you know, you have a subatomic level and an atomic level and a molecular level

1327
01:51:09,633 --> 01:51:14,400
And, you know, then a, maybe a level of organs

1328
01:51:14,633 --> 01:51:16,533
And then there's you and then there's your family

1329
01:51:16,633 --> 01:51:20,433
And so on, all the way up the tree, fundamentally

1330
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:26,466
And so I think that what this tree represents, and this is the thing that the shaman moves up and down,

1331
01:51:26,933 --> 01:51:28,433
I think that's what it represents.

1332
01:51:28,433 --> 01:51:30,000
It's this different view of

1333
01:51:31,533 --> 01:51:32,500
its dimensionality.

1334
01:51:32,533 --> 01:51:33,200
It's something like that.

1335
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:38,233
And I think that what happens in the psychedelic experience is that consciousness can travel up and down that structure.

1336
01:51:38,766 --> 01:51:42,600
It's something like that, and maybe not only up and down it, but maybe right through it.

1337
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:45,500
I know that's a radical claim.

1338
01:51:45,533 --> 01:51:47,833
It's a really radical claim, and it might be wrong,

1339
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:52,933
but it's probably wrong even because most radical claims are wrong, but

1340
01:51:54,633 --> 01:52:02,100
But but I'm not so sure it's wrong

1341
01:52:04,866 --> 01:52:05,633
And here's something cool

1342
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:10,466
So that's the Scandinavian world tree and that was drawn

1343
01:52:11,666 --> 01:52:15,533
By an anthropologist who visited the tribes in the Amazon who use ayahuasca

1344
01:52:21,333 --> 01:52:23,533
Now you see it's a snake.

1345
01:52:23,533 --> 01:52:24,266
It's a tree with snakes

1346
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:30,300
Well, you know that's reminiscent of the story in Adam and Eve obviously, but it's also reminiscent of our

1347
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,533
Primate dwelling place right because that was basically our ancestral home a tree

1348
01:52:36,566 --> 01:52:40,500
Surrounded by snakes and the snakes like to eat us, and this is a long time ago.

1349
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,600
This is like 50 billion years ago

1350
01:52:44,166 --> 01:52:49,966
It's really a long time ago, and so we don't know where these images come from precisely

1351
01:52:50,533 --> 01:52:59,833
but I do have the suspicion that that we used the circuitry that we developed to detect snakes to represent

1352
01:52:59,933 --> 01:53:08,666
the unknown as such because like a snake is something that comes out of the unknown and like we evolved right we all evolved out of an animal substructure

1353
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:14,566
and so we had to get our our biological cognitive structure from somewhere and

1354
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,166
we have this capacity of thinking about the absolute unknown and the terrors

1355
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:26,433
that are involved in that that the horrors that can emerge from what we don't understand and it stands perfectly to reason that we would use circuits

1356
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:29,566
that were already pre-developed for that and that this is a reasonable

1357
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:42,533
representation of the existential structure of the world so and I think I might have showed you this before but it never ceases to amaze me this this

1358
01:53:42,733 --> 01:53:49,700
picture so my son drew this when he was nine eight and so on the right you see mushroom houses and

1359
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:56,666
They have the names of all his friends on them and so that's order right and then on the left side you see

1360
01:53:57,300 --> 01:54:03,066
Chaos there and that little orange thing is a bug and then there's a river that runs right down the middle and so that's like

1361
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:09,733
the yin yang symbol with the divide in the middle that's quite cool, and then there's there it is.

1362
01:54:09,766 --> 01:54:10,533
There's Jacob's ladder

1363
01:54:11,666 --> 01:54:16,400
It's like Jack and the Beanstalk which is by the way another variant of the same shamanic story and

1364
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:23,033
There are bugs going up and down it and they're taking messages from heaven and then up there in heaven

1365
01:54:24,033 --> 01:54:28,400
It's got the sun and there's St.. Peter, and I don't know where in the world he got this

1366
01:54:28,633 --> 01:54:30,733
It's not like he had a lot of religious education.

1367
01:54:30,766 --> 01:54:32,466
I mean really despite me

1368
01:54:34,433 --> 01:54:35,966
And you know there's the pearly gates up there

1369
01:54:36,066 --> 01:54:39,766
And then that was the world as far as his he had a very well-ordered psyche

1370
01:54:40,033 --> 01:54:48,433
I would say and and still does but when he drew that it just absolutely blew me away, and so I had it laminated and it's in my office because

1371
01:54:49,733 --> 01:54:52,233
Well, I don't know because like what the hell do you make of that?

1372
01:54:52,266 --> 01:54:53,566
You know that's that's why

1373
01:54:54,766 --> 01:54:54,900
so

1374
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:08,200
Well, you sort of get the picture there.

1375
01:55:08,233 --> 01:55:10,733
You know the cathedrals the great cathedrals of Europe are

1376
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:18,200
They're like the forest in stone right and they try to represent the light coming through the leaves

1377
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:20,766
And so it's sort of our ancestral forest home

1378
01:55:20,966 --> 01:55:24,333
But it's it's transformed into these great sculptures of stone

1379
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:29,600
And you know they produce awe because of the combination of light and darkness and color

1380
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:38,666
But also I think for the same reason that huge trees produce awe in people you know and we don't want them cut down they seem sacred in some sense and perhaps they are

1381
01:55:39,666 --> 01:55:39,833
but

1382
01:55:41,966 --> 01:55:53,000
you know it also seemed to me this is an intuition that the The architects of these great cathedrals were trying to get, they're trying to express something that's deep and structural.

1383
01:55:53,066 --> 01:56:05,033
They're trying to express the idea that if being was constituted properly, then it would be organized from the subatomic level all the way up to the highest cosmic level perfectly.

1384
01:56:05,633 --> 01:56:09,000
So every layer stacked on top of each other without any contradictions.

1385
01:56:09,066 --> 01:56:15,000
That would be an ideal mode of being and everything would come together under those circumstances.

1386
01:56:15,066 --> 01:56:17,733
And that's what's being expressed in these cathedrals.

1387
01:56:17,866 --> 01:56:20,933
It's not all that's being expressed, because they're also shaped like a cross.

1388
01:56:21,066 --> 01:56:29,300
And, you know, the idea is that the center of the cross, which is the center of suffering, is also the place of the individual, the place where the transformation takes place.

1389
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:31,333
That's all built into the architecture as well.

1390
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:41,566
And so, then there's the tree-like structures that make us up.

1391
01:56:43,733 --> 01:56:49,133
It's stretched down to the tiniest realities,

1392
01:56:50,300 --> 01:57:04,266
microcosm and there's this this idea it's all represented in the same way again it's this idea especially the Mandela up in the top right it's the

1393
01:57:04,366 --> 01:57:12,600
idea of this perfection of crystalline structure and that's what the yogis are trying to attain when they organize their bodies they're trying to get every

1394
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:25,333
single layer of their being aligned properly and it's something like you can kind of see an echo of that in the I think that's a Tibetan sand painting if I remember correctly, on the bottom left.

1395
01:57:26,166 --> 01:57:37,333
The idea is that if you get yourself a line properly, then information can flow along that tree that's you, without without impediment, something like that.

1396
01:57:37,333 --> 01:57:40,000
And that would be like a state of optimal health.

1397
01:57:40,033 --> 01:57:44,566
And that both physical and spiritual exercises can put you in that state.

1398
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:49,700
And that's, well, those are all clouds of ideas that surround this idea of a ladder to heaven.

1399
01:57:51,966 --> 01:57:58,400
And so Jacob is talking to God, and God says, Behold, I am with thee, and I will keep thee

1400
01:57:58,533 --> 01:58:02,766
in all places where you go and bring you again into this land, for I won't leave you until

1401
01:58:02,966 --> 01:58:04,700
I have done that which I have spoken to you of.

1402
01:58:05,333 --> 01:58:10,933
And Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place, and

1403
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:11,600
I knew it not.

1404
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,033
And he was afraid and said, How dreadful is this place!

1405
01:58:14,966 --> 01:58:17,900
This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.

1406
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:25,466
And Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on top of it.

1407
01:58:25,966 --> 01:58:26,733
That's a sacrifice.

1408
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:32,000
And he called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was called Luz at the first.

1409
01:58:32,566 --> 01:58:36,700
And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that

1410
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:42,000
I go, and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my Father's

1411
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:44,333
house in peace, then shall the Lord be my God.

1412
01:58:45,033 --> 01:58:47,766
And this stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house.

1413
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:52,933
And of all of that, that is given to me, I will surely give the tenth unto thee.

1414
01:58:55,033 --> 01:58:56,766
And that's a pretty good place to stop.

1415
01:58:58,533 --> 01:58:59,733
So, now, I'll just...

1416
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:03,200
...conclude.

1417
01:59:03,233 --> 01:59:07,200
So, you have this very morally ambivalent character, right?

1418
01:59:07,366 --> 01:59:12,300
Who's, so far, pretty much everything he's done, that we're familiar with, is not good.

1419
01:59:13,066 --> 01:59:18,733
so he's he's betrayed his brother horribly twice badly enough so that he his brother wants to kill him and

1420
01:59:19,566 --> 01:59:21,433
Everyone can kind of sympathize with his brother

1421
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:30,400
so and then he runs away essentially because his mother tells him to which is not exactly a testament to his character and despite that

1422
01:59:31,766 --> 01:59:37,566
Strangely enough he has this experience you know and that's heartening.

1423
01:59:37,566 --> 01:59:39,533
I guess and that's the point is that

1424
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:44,500
that people are predisposed to terrible error.

1425
01:59:44,833 --> 01:59:46,000
There's no doubt about that.

1426
01:59:46,733 --> 01:59:52,266
And yet, when I was writing my latest book, I had a friend of mine.

1427
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:55,266
Norman Deutsch wrote the foreword.

1428
01:59:55,966 --> 01:59:58,900
And Norman's written a couple of great books, and he's Jewish.

1429
01:59:59,733 --> 02:00:06,366
And he read some of what I'd written, and he took me to task for making the God of the Old Testament,

1430
02:00:06,566 --> 02:00:10,200
know, from a Christian perspective, too harsh and unforgiving.

1431
02:00:10,233 --> 02:00:16,200
And I rewrote a fair bit of it because of his criticism and because of what I've learned doing these lectures.

1432
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:18,600
It's like, it's not exactly right, you know.

1433
02:00:18,633 --> 02:00:23,366
I mean, what happens in the Old Testament is if you screw up, especially if you know you do

1434
02:00:23,700 --> 02:00:26,733
and you decide that you're not going to do anything about it, so it's conscious

1435
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:29,933
and deliberate, then, like, look the hell out.

1436
02:00:29,933 --> 02:00:31,233
You are in serious trouble.

1437
02:00:31,266 --> 02:00:34,600
And I actually think that's also psychologically accurate.

1438
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:39,666
One of the Jung pointed out and this always struck me was that if you don't know what you're doing

1439
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:46,433
This is actually in the gospel of thomas as well interestingly enough as one of the gothic Gospels Christ tells his followers something like

1440
02:00:47,300 --> 02:00:50,633
If you make a mistake, and you don't know what you're doing, then you'll be forgiven for it

1441
02:00:51,300 --> 02:01:03,600
but if you make a mistake knowing what you're doing and you do it anyways then like good luck to you and and I think that's I think that's That's psychologically accurate I mean

1442
02:01:03,633 --> 02:01:16,066
I mean, one of the things that's very interesting about the judgmental God in the Old Testament, however, is that he can be bargained with,

1443
02:01:16,566 --> 02:01:27,500
and even if you make mistakes, especially if you're unconscious of them, if you haven't learned yet, let's say, then you always have the opportunity to return to the proper path.

1444
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:34,366
And that's- people get cynical about that, because there's, you know, this mostly Christian idea that you could live a terribly sinful life,

1445
02:01:34,566 --> 02:01:39,866
But if you repented on your deathbed, it's like heaven for you, and it's like oh, that's that sounds like a great deal, right?

1446
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:45,233
It's like you can do whatever the hell you want until just before you die of course you might not know when that is

1447
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:47,700
So that's a problem you then you can just say well

1448
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:48,233
I'm sorry

1449
02:01:48,433 --> 02:01:54,200
And you know everything's forgiven, but the problem with being cynical about that sort of thing is that it's no trivial matter to repent

1450
02:01:55,733 --> 02:02:04,500
you know because to repent means a a figure out what you actually did and the worst things that you did the more horrible it is to figure it out

1451
02:02:05,133 --> 02:02:11,733
It's no joke right and there's no genuine repentance without understanding of the depth of your depravity and so

1452
02:02:13,433 --> 02:02:17,500
If you've lived a particularly reprehensible life, and you come to understand it

1453
02:02:17,833 --> 02:02:27,200
I think that in and of itself could kill you you know it's a terrible thing to Wake up and see what you've done if what you've done is truly terrible

1454
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:30,866
So there's no easy out.

1455
02:02:30,866 --> 02:02:32,000
It's not an easy out.

1456
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:36,166
It's just pure cynicism to associate that idea with an easy out.

1457
02:02:36,166 --> 02:02:36,466
It's not.

1458
02:02:37,166 --> 02:02:45,466
But there is that positive idea that's continually represented is that the individual is the source of moral choice.

1459
02:02:46,233 --> 02:02:54,100
And the individual is prone to genuine error and temptation in a believable and realistic way.

1460
02:02:54,833 --> 02:03:01,200
That that doesn't sever the relationship between the individual and the divine and the possibility of further growth

1461
02:03:01,833 --> 02:03:02,633
And then I would say well

1462
02:03:02,700 --> 02:03:13,300
Thank God for that because without that like who would have a chance right who would have a chance and so The idea that the deity has presented the infinite

1463
02:03:13,433 --> 02:03:23,333
Let's say as presented in the old testament is merely judgmental is definitely wrong and and is in fact something that you can Contend with and bargain with I'll close with one thing

1464
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:29,366
one of the things that I learned while I was going through this was the meaning of the name Israel

1465
02:03:29,733 --> 02:03:35,133
because Jacob Eventually gets named Israel, and and I'm jumping ahead a little bit to the next lecture, but

1466
02:03:36,133 --> 02:03:45,300
Israel and so he's also the father of Israel and the father of the 12 sons who make up the 12 tribes of Israel, but what Israel means is he who struggles with God and

1467
02:03:46,566 --> 02:03:50,333
that's such an interesting idea because it's again a psychological idea and

1468
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:57,800
And that's why I said earlier that it isn't obvious in the Old Testament what it means to believe in God, because what Jacob does is struggle with God.

1469
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:04,233
And I think that that's a really good characterization of an ethical life, because if you're trying

1470
02:04:04,300 --> 02:04:07,633
to lead an ethical life, that's what you're doing, is you're struggling.

1471
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:13,233
Like blind belief isn't helpful, because you don't know what you're believing in, like it's just not that helpful.

1472
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:24,833
But if you're possessed by the desire to orient yourself properly, but also confused by the existential structure of the world, which we all are, then what you're doing

1473
02:04:24,966 --> 02:04:28,666
when you're trying to orient yourself properly in life is struggling ethically.

1474
02:04:29,866 --> 02:04:31,433
And Jacob actually gets quite hurt.

1475
02:04:31,533 --> 02:04:35,366
He wrestles with God, literally, and God dislocates his thigh.

1476
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:39,966
And so, you know, the idea there is, watch the hell out, right?

1477
02:04:40,033 --> 02:04:44,866
The thing that you're contending with is powerful, although you can contend with it.

1478
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,233
That's the thing that's so interesting.

1479
02:04:46,633 --> 02:04:50,500
But you know, you do it at some genuine peril, which I think is exactly right.

1480
02:04:50,933 --> 02:04:52,000
But the idea that Israel…

1481
02:04:52,266 --> 02:04:56,300
So there's Israel the state, let's say, and Israel the promised land, and all of that.

1482
02:04:56,433 --> 02:05:07,300
But there's this more important idea, which is again a psychological idea, which is the state of Israel, which is the promised land, is the state that everyone who wrestles with God exists in.

1483
02:05:08,533 --> 02:05:16,900
And that's not happy, naive belief in, you know, an eternally blessed afterlife.

1484
02:05:17,033 --> 02:05:17,700
It's not that.

1485
02:05:18,066 --> 02:05:19,133
It's not a wish fulfillment.

1486
02:05:20,433 --> 02:05:25,166
It's to be actively engaged in life, in the difficulties of life, right?

1487
02:05:25,566 --> 02:05:31,400
And trying to find the path, because that's what wrestling with God is, is trying to find the path.

1488
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:38,166
And that seems to me what belief means fundamentally in the Old Testament, and perhaps in the New testament as well is that

1489
02:05:38,833 --> 02:05:45,366
Belief is expressed in trying to find the path and that's an ethical struggle, and it's a real struggle

1490
02:05:45,433 --> 02:05:53,200
It's the struggle of life, so as long as you're willing to engage in that struggle then hypothetically you have the divine behind you and

1491
02:05:54,366 --> 02:06:04,900
so I believe that I think that's true because the other thing I see is that the people who set things right so that

1492
02:06:05,033 --> 02:06:12,166
that the horrible forces of cosmic destruction don't do us in, the people

1493
02:06:12,233 --> 02:06:15,333
who are trying to set things right are the ones that are struggling ethically.

1494
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:19,900
And so, and that, there is a redemptive element to that.

1495
02:06:19,900 --> 02:06:23,400
And I don't think there's any way of being cynical about that.

1496
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:26,733
So, well, so thank you, Will.

1497
02:06:26,766 --> 02:06:54,466
So remember to speak right into the mic, because there are all these other

1498
02:06:54,633 --> 02:07:02,833
people watching that will hear that will hear us so okay hi dr. Peterson so with

1499
02:07:02,866 --> 02:07:05,866
the story of Jacob today there was a theme of betrayal and you can see that

1500
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:09,333
from the beginning because he was very angry and jealous at his brother and I

1501
02:07:09,366 --> 02:07:13,100
was thinking are there any stories or what can say about betrayal that does

1502
02:07:13,233 --> 02:07:17,166
come from a loved one right where it's not from a place of so black and white

1503
02:07:17,366 --> 02:07:23,433
of anger resentment and bitter and how do the parties kind of recover from that

1504
02:07:23,633 --> 02:07:27,733
Or is there any way to rename that or is it as black and white as if you betray someone then there?

1505
02:07:27,933 --> 02:07:29,900
It's like Jacob where he was bitter.

1506
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:32,966
He was hatred no and in fact in this story.

1507
02:07:32,966 --> 02:07:36,900
It's not black and white because we know we're only halfway through it and

1508
02:07:38,666 --> 02:07:48,100
One of the things I've noticed as a clinician let's say is that and as an observer of people in general is that I've never ever seen anyone get away with anything and

1509
02:07:49,033 --> 02:07:51,633
Jacob doesn't get away with any of this and so

1510
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:59,866
So, you know, he's humbled by his eventual experiences, and he learns that he did it wrong.

1511
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:03,400
And there's reconciliation that happens throughout the story of Jacob.

1512
02:08:04,633 --> 02:08:09,400
And there's minor betrayals and major betrayals, you know, that some of them have tremendously

1513
02:08:09,533 --> 02:08:12,300
serious consequences, and some of them have lesser consequences.

1514
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:18,600
But there is an underlying idea that things can still be set right, even though it's – well,

1515
02:08:19,633 --> 02:08:24,266
I think it takes Jacob some 20 years, something like that, to set things right.

1516
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:26,033
And even then, it's like touch and go.

1517
02:08:26,966 --> 02:08:29,300
So did I answer your question?

1518
02:08:30,833 --> 02:08:30,933
Okay.

1519
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:31,133
Yeah.

1520
02:08:32,366 --> 02:08:32,566
Hey.

1521
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:39,866
You speak frequently in your lectures about, I guess, the war between good and evil, or

1522
02:08:40,100 --> 02:08:46,566
the struggle of life, really, is a struggle between good and evil being at the core of a conscious, lived existence.

1523
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:56,566
And I guess on that note, if you were 100% certain that there was no afterlife, would

1524
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:02,133
you still be able to preach that there's a positive meaning in life?

1525
02:09:03,200 --> 02:09:08,700
If you were 100% certain, some atheists seem to be 100% certain, and yet they still preach

1526
02:09:08,833 --> 02:09:11,600
that there's some positive meaning to life, would you be one of those?

1527
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:14,933
Or would you turn into Cain, you know, so cynical?

1528
02:09:16,033 --> 02:09:22,733
I think that, well, as far as I'm concerned, one of the things I learned from studying 20th century history is that

1529
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:28,866
like, even if the idea that, even if you take the most cynical of ideas, let's say, that life is

1530
02:09:29,633 --> 02:09:33,466
irredeemable suffering, and perhaps isn't even justified because of that,

1531
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:40,033
it still seems to me that you have an ethical duty, let's say,

1532
02:09:40,833 --> 02:09:45,333
to live in a manner that reduces that to the degree that that's possible.

1533
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:52,800
And so, and I think that that can be experienced as meaningful, in some sense, independently of the transcendent context.

1534
02:09:53,566 --> 02:09:56,833
Now, I don't exactly know how to strip off the transcendent context,

1535
02:09:57,133 --> 02:09:59,866
because one of the things I would say that's happened to me is,

1536
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:03,800
because I've spent so much time looking at the horrible things that people have done,

1537
02:10:03,900 --> 02:10:07,466
is that it's, like Jung said that, this is one of his famous quotes,

1538
02:10:08,233 --> 02:10:12,700
he said, no tree can reach up to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell.

1539
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:28,566
And so, as I've dug deeper into the depravity of human beings, my sense of the possibility of human beings has also grown, what would you say, in proportion, until I've become

1540
02:10:28,733 --> 02:10:34,533
convinced actually that good is a more powerful force than evil, even though evil is an unbelievably powerful force.

1541
02:10:35,333 --> 02:10:37,700
And so I can't really strip the transcendent away now.

1542
02:10:38,533 --> 02:10:45,500
bearing that has on eternity, say on an afterlife, I mean, I can't say anything about that.

1543
02:10:46,166 --> 02:10:55,966
The only thing I guess I can say is that there are many things about being that we don't understand in the least, and we don't understand the nature of consciousness or the nature of time.

1544
02:10:57,033 --> 02:11:06,700
So I wouldn't despair about that, but yes, I think that life can still be meaningful without there being a necessity of an afterlife.

1545
02:11:07,300 --> 02:11:10,633
Could you get through one lecture without using the word transcendence, though?

1546
02:11:10,733 --> 02:11:10,900
No, no.

1547
02:11:11,266 --> 02:11:11,366
No.

1548
02:11:17,566 --> 02:11:18,233
Hi, Dr. Peterson.

1549
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:20,633
So since studying your work, one of the things

1550
02:11:20,733 --> 02:11:26,500
that I find most fascinating is your analysis of the story of Cain and Abel.

1551
02:11:27,366 --> 02:11:32,566
And my question is, if Cain got to the point

1552
02:11:34,566 --> 02:11:43,700
The point that he did right before killing his brother, murdering his ideal, and decided that that was something he didn't want to do.

1553
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:49,166
What advice or guidance would you give a person that got to that point?

1554
02:11:53,800 --> 02:12:00,533
Well, there's a story I read called The Cocktail Party.

1555
02:12:00,933 --> 02:12:03,233
I've mentioned this before by T.S.

1556
02:12:03,266 --> 02:12:05,833
Elliot, and in The Cocktail Party there's a scene, it's a play,

1557
02:12:06,533 --> 02:12:11,666
where this woman approaches a psychiatrist and starts talking to him about her problems.

1558
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:14,366
And she says something that surprises him, she says,

1559
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:16,633
I hope that I'm the problem.

1560
02:12:17,233 --> 02:12:18,666
And he says, well why would you hope that?

1561
02:12:19,200 --> 02:12:23,533
And she says, well I've thought about it a lot, and if the world's the problem, then I'm done,

1562
02:12:23,666 --> 02:12:29,566
because I can't change the world, but if I'm the problem, then maybe there's something about myself I can change,

1563
02:12:29,900 --> 02:12:35,333
I can undo this terrible situation that I'm in and so I would say that's repentance

1564
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:46,100
fundamentally, it's like there if and I say this carefully because I understand that people are susceptible to bad fortune

1565
02:12:48,866 --> 02:12:55,633
Sin and ignorance can make that worse, but independently of that like good people suffer make no mistake about it

1566
02:12:56,800 --> 02:13:05,600
but if things aren't right for you, if you're resentful about being, because that's the right way of

1567
02:13:06,533 --> 02:13:08,400
Because that's the deepest way of thinking about it.

1568
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:11,733
If you read the writings of the people who do the mass killings for example

1569
02:13:12,133 --> 02:13:13,466
That's what you see over and over.

1570
02:13:13,466 --> 02:13:14,000
It's Cain.

1571
02:13:14,033 --> 02:13:23,700
It's like they're angry beyond comprehension at the Intolerability of being and they're angry at God, even if they don't say it exactly like that

1572
02:13:23,933 --> 02:13:27,900
They come so close to saying it like that that it's there's no difference

1573
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:34,600
you know what God says to Cain is look to yourself first before you criticize being and

1574
02:13:37,033 --> 02:13:39,633
That strikes me as right.

1575
02:13:39,666 --> 02:13:43,966
It's because to not do that is arrogant beyond belief that's satanic arrogance

1576
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:47,400
Literally if something like that can be literal.

1577
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:51,166
It's like don't make yourself the judge of being before you clean up your

1578
02:13:51,200 --> 02:13:52,466
Oh, your room, let's say.

1579
02:13:56,833 --> 02:14:02,366
Because the other thing too, this is something I learned in some part from Solzhenitsyn, when he was in the prison camps and trying

1580
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:09,233
to understand how these heroic people he saw could possibly manage it, one of the exercises he undertook, and he really viewed this within a

1581
02:14:09,633 --> 02:14:16,566
Christian Orthodox context of repentance and redemption, is he said he went over his life with a fine-toothed comb and tried to

1582
02:14:18,433 --> 02:14:25,566
imagine all of the ethical mistakes he made in his entire life that he knew were mistakes, right?

1583
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:33,400
It was a soul search, he wasn't relying on external standards of morality, except in so far as were inevitably influenced by those,

1584
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:40,266
and then his idea was, is there something I could do right now to put that right?

1585
02:14:40,266 --> 02:14:43,266
And that's the right question, like if things aren't going your way, and

1586
02:14:44,133 --> 02:14:47,900
And I think that means that you're resentful and arrogant and deceitful.

1587
02:14:47,933 --> 02:14:49,566
Those are the three things that clump together

1588
02:14:49,933 --> 02:14:56,800
I think that that constitute the core of evil at something like that, and so if you're possessed by that which is a hell

1589
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,466
Then it's repentance

1590
02:14:59,633 --> 02:15:03,466
That's the right answer and what that means is you have to figure out what you did wrong

1591
02:15:04,433 --> 02:15:10,200
And you have to pay for it, and then at least you could think well look I can try that with all of my soul

1592
02:15:10,733 --> 02:15:12,300
Let's say and see what happens

1593
02:15:13,400 --> 02:15:13,666
Right?

1594
02:15:13,666 --> 02:15:16,966
It can at least be an experiment, and then I would also say that that's an act of faith.

1595
02:15:17,433 --> 02:15:21,666
It's an act of faith to conduct that experiment, because you put yourself on the line, right?

1596
02:15:22,033 --> 02:15:23,433
And that's what an act of faith is.

1597
02:15:23,466 --> 02:15:24,266
You don't know the outcome,

1598
02:15:24,633 --> 02:15:26,600
but you don't know the outcome of your life.

1599
02:15:26,633 --> 02:15:28,500
So to live, in some sense, is an act of faith.

1600
02:15:29,133 --> 02:15:30,800
You're putting faith in something.

1601
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:32,333
That's why you're moving forward.

1602
02:15:32,333 --> 02:15:34,300
You couldn't move forward without an act of faith.

1603
02:15:35,500 --> 02:15:38,666
You know, and people say, well, I only move forward on the basis of the facts.

1604
02:15:38,833 --> 02:15:43,700
It's like yeah, but you select the facts and there's an infinity of facts, and they don't just tell you what to do

1605
02:15:43,900 --> 02:15:45,433
So it's not a credible answer

1606
02:15:46,666 --> 02:15:48,533
So if you're in that situation, it's like

1607
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:51,666
Look to yourself

1608
02:15:52,666 --> 02:15:56,600
You know and one of the things about Solzhenitsyn that's so bloody amazing is that's what he did

1609
02:15:56,600 --> 02:16:05,666
and then he wrote the Gulag Archipelago, and you know he took an axe to the intellectual and moral substructure of of the totalitarian communist states

1610
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:11,566
so while he was redeeming himself let's say he was simultaneously redeeming the world and

1611
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:15,966
You see something like that like you you got to wake up man.

1612
02:16:15,966 --> 02:16:16,200
That's

1613
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:18,866
That was really something

1614
02:16:19,733 --> 02:16:19,866
so

1615
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:29,433
Yeah, Dr.. Peterson

1616
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:38,733
I have a lot of questions that arise from your comments at the bell for 100 event your m103 video your recent discussion with Ayaan Hershey Ali and your comments on Islam in the west in general and

1617
02:16:39,433 --> 02:16:42,833
And in your comments there's this common theme that one of these things is not like the other.

1618
02:16:43,366 --> 02:16:46,866
You put the Judeo-Christian tradition on the one side and Islam on the other.

1619
02:16:47,900 --> 02:16:52,566
Specifically the quote complex problem of Islam and the quote as a quote totalizing system.

1620
02:16:53,500 --> 02:17:01,866
Before I go further let me state that if hypothetically a final analysis of Islam resulted in as total a denunciation as your analysis of postmodernism or neo-Marxism,

1621
02:17:02,433 --> 02:17:03,800
I wouldn't be personally offended at all.

1622
02:17:03,833 --> 02:17:05,900
This isn't a personal question.

1623
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:11,866
In your recent interview with Ayaan Hirsi Ali, she said Western values are superior to Islamic law and Islamic values.

1624
02:17:12,933 --> 02:17:16,866
I agree with that, basically, certainly in the context of, let's say, current global affairs.

1625
02:17:17,566 --> 02:17:19,866
I'll skip the quotes from her Reason magazine interview, but you should read them,

1626
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:23,866
because hers is a worldview which is very much the West versus Islam.

1627
02:17:24,633 --> 02:17:27,866
Not radical Islam, but Islam, including necessarily the military option.

1628
02:17:28,966 --> 02:17:32,866
So my question is, at the level of psychological significance of these stories, at the level of mythology and archetype,

1629
02:17:33,066 --> 02:17:36,533
and archetyped, how is Islam so different from the Judeo-Christian tradition?

1630
02:17:37,033 --> 02:17:42,300
You know, because Adam, Adam, Eve, Hava, Satan, Shaitan, so on and so forth, everything from the fall to the flood,

1631
02:17:43,866 --> 02:17:47,000
a lot of what you've discussed in this lecture series is necessarily part of Islam as well.

1632
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:51,500
And in fact, I think one of the strongest criticism of Islam is that it's perhaps pretty unoriginal.

1633
02:17:52,466 --> 02:17:57,800
You know, tonight you said that the moral presuppositions of a culture are instantiated in its stories.

1634
02:17:58,200 --> 02:17:59,566
I see a lot of the same stories.

1635
02:18:00,033 --> 02:18:01,166
So current global affairs aside,

1636
02:18:01,233 --> 02:18:05,933
I'm asking at the deepest levels how different are these stories and the moral presuppositions?

1637
02:18:06,833 --> 02:18:08,466
Okay, well that's that's a killer question

1638
02:18:11,300 --> 02:18:11,466
well

1639
02:18:12,566 --> 02:18:16,666
okay, so the first thing I would say is fundamentally, I don't know and

1640
02:18:18,066 --> 02:18:24,100
So part of the reason that I'm one of the things I'm planning to do is to have a series of discussions and plenty of people

1641
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:38,433
Have contacted me about discussing with Ayaan Hirsi Ali as you know she has as powerful and serious foes, and they're not happy with her black and white distinction.

1642
02:18:39,833 --> 02:18:43,600
And so, now I read Infidel, and I really liked that book.

1643
02:18:44,633 --> 02:18:47,066
My sense was that she was a heroine.

1644
02:18:48,200 --> 02:19:01,633
Now what that means in relationship to Islam, that's a different story, because she came out of a totalitarian, let's say, family structure in a relatively totalitarian society.

1645
02:19:02,266 --> 02:19:06,466
And you could make the case that there's a correspondence between that and Islam, and

1646
02:19:06,466 --> 02:19:09,933
you could make the case that there isn't, and of course that's the critical issue.

1647
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:20,066
And so, there's a couple of things that I can't wrap my head around with, wrap my head around easily in relationship to Islam.

1648
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:25,966
And so one is what I see as the failure to separate church from state.

1649
02:19:26,966 --> 02:19:28,933
And that's a problem.

1650
02:19:30,866 --> 02:19:39,300
Now it may not be a problem as such, but it's certainly a problem in relationship to the relation between Islam and the West, because we separate church from state.

1651
02:19:39,900 --> 02:19:45,766
Now there's fundamentalists in the United States, Christian fundamentalists, who think that that separation is a mistake.

1652
02:19:46,866 --> 02:19:53,066
So it's not only an idea that's rooted in Islam that those should be united.

1653
02:19:54,133 --> 02:19:59,466
But it's definitely a problem with regards to our co-existence, because that's a fundamentally different presumption.

1654
02:20:00,266 --> 02:20:01,733
So that's problem number one.

1655
02:20:03,100 --> 02:20:07,300
Problem number two for me, and again this may be a consequence of my ignorance which

1656
02:20:07,433 --> 02:20:11,000
I'm trying to rectify, Muhammad was a warlord.

1657
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:15,633
And I don't know what to do about that fact.

1658
02:20:17,166 --> 02:20:30,433
Like one thing you can say about Christ, hypothetically, let's say, I'm not talking about a historical reality necessarily, although I'm not denying it either, is that of all the things he was,

1659
02:20:30,766 --> 02:20:33,200
Warlord was definitely not one of them.

1660
02:20:34,766 --> 02:20:36,366
And I don't know what to do about that.

1661
02:20:38,433 --> 02:20:41,300
And so I don't know how to reconcile that.

1662
02:20:42,133 --> 02:20:48,466
And I don't know how to reconcile, like, not only was Muhammad a warlord, which I don't

1663
02:20:48,700 --> 02:21:00,100
think is an unreasonable thing to proclaim, the expansion that he initiated was unbelievably successful.

1664
02:21:00,266 --> 02:21:04,633
I mean, within 600 years, it was the biggest empire the world had ever seen.

1665
02:21:05,466 --> 02:21:10,433
And it demolished Byzantine Christianity, which is something that Western people don't even know.

1666
02:21:11,300 --> 02:21:21,333
You know I've read thinkers who said that the west was so traumatized culturally let's say by the demolition of Byzantine Christianity that we can't even study it now and

1667
02:21:22,733 --> 02:21:27,066
so I don't know if that's true, but I don't know that it's not true either and

1668
02:21:28,733 --> 02:21:36,866
The Buddhists were wiped out of Afghanistan and we saw that echoed in the Taliban's destruction of those great Buddhist monuments and

1669
02:21:37,566 --> 02:21:37,766
so

1670
02:21:40,733 --> 02:21:51,566
So what I'm hoping is that there's a bridge there better be a bridge and that's why I want to have these discussions because I'd like to

1671
02:21:52,200 --> 02:22:01,666
understand if there's a bridge and so lots of people have sent me people who I should talk to who they think represent Islam far better than Ayaan Hirzi Ali and

1672
02:22:02,433 --> 02:22:10,466
Perhaps they're correct and hopefully I'll get an opportunity to talk to them because I would like to know why I would like to know if what I think is wrong

1673
02:22:11,800 --> 02:22:14,266
Because if it's wrong, it's important that I know it's wrong

1674
02:22:15,566 --> 02:22:17,633
but At the moment.

1675
02:22:17,666 --> 02:22:28,366
I don't a I don't know it's wrong and B. I don't see I'm not sure what it signifies

1676
02:22:30,666 --> 02:22:36,566
So and I don't think anyone is sure right because we have this entangled

1677
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:44,533
Entangling of the civilizations you know when there's other things to like I'm not very happy with the saudi arabs and the wahhabis

1678
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:52,900
I Don't think there are allies I don't see how any western woman can possibly think that there are allies and

1679
02:22:54,000 --> 02:23:00,666
I'm not happy with the fact that the petrodollars that we send them are transformed in substantial part into

1680
02:23:02,266 --> 02:23:10,066
The kind of propaganda that's definitely a threat to the west, and I'm not very happy with the fact that our politicians appear

1681
02:23:11,333 --> 02:23:16,600
Stupidly blind to that now that may again be a consequence of my ignorance.

1682
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:20,000
It's certainly possible but those are the sorts of things that

1683
02:23:22,566 --> 02:23:24,500
That I can't reconcile and so

1684
02:23:29,566 --> 02:23:39,066
You know, I've seen, I've also seen parallels between the ideas that I'm presenting here and other religious traditions, Taoism, Buddhism, Hinduism.

1685
02:23:39,833 --> 02:23:43,166
It's harder for me to bridge the gap with Islam, and I'm not sure why that is.

1686
02:23:44,066 --> 02:23:46,500
I think it has something to do with the things that I just laid out.

1687
02:23:47,266 --> 02:23:53,500
Now, what I don't know about Islam would fill very many volumes, many of which I have sitting on my shelves at home right now,

1688
02:23:53,866 --> 02:23:57,433
because I want to do the reading, you know, as I progress through this.

1689
02:24:10,333 --> 02:24:11,633
Good evening, Dr. Pearson.

1690
02:24:11,633 --> 02:24:13,300
Thanks for continuing this series.

1691
02:24:14,133 --> 02:24:21,166
Even us atheists appreciate the interaction and the conversation.

1692
02:24:21,633 --> 02:24:33,700
I wanted to ask you something that is both emotional and analytical because oftentimes you're basically pegged as seeing things very analytically.

1693
02:24:34,366 --> 02:24:49,900
So you were talking earlier about, you were talking about the juxtaposition between happiness and honor, even though I don't think they're mutually exclusive personally,

1694
02:24:49,966 --> 02:24:56,600
but if there's a situation, let's say, where someone is truly in love with someone else,

1695
02:24:56,933 --> 02:25:00,666
and they love them for many years and decades, they have a whole history together,

1696
02:25:01,833 --> 02:25:09,333
and then someone, and then one of the people in this grouping, start falling in love with someone else.

1697
02:25:10,833 --> 02:25:27,333
So, it's not that there's less love for the original partner, how analytically and emotionally do you take care of a situation like that, when you feel that you want to stay honourable and be happy?

1698
02:25:28,700 --> 02:25:31,933
Okay, so the first thing I would say is the devil's always in the details.

1699
02:25:32,900 --> 02:25:40,433
Right, so one of the things that I'm not happy about with much modern moral theorizing is that

1700
02:25:41,366 --> 02:25:46,566
It takes a story like that, you know, and then tries to extract out a general moral principle.

1701
02:25:46,766 --> 02:25:52,500
And often that's impossible, because the particulars of the situation are very important.

1702
02:25:53,466 --> 02:25:54,566
But having said that...

1703
02:25:55,766 --> 02:25:57,466
Alright, so let me think about that for a minute.

1704
02:25:58,900 --> 02:26:06,033
I'm not sure that it's possible to be honorable in a situation like that, because I think that you've acted out the violation already.

1705
02:26:07,133 --> 02:26:13,100
And having acted out the violation, to confess it, might be the right thing to do, although perhaps not.

1706
02:26:14,133 --> 02:26:14,866
You know, because if you...

1707
02:26:15,733 --> 02:26:19,966
It isn't obvious to me that if you betray someone, then you get to have the right to tell them about it.

1708
02:26:20,400 --> 02:26:21,133
I'm not saying that.

1709
02:26:21,300 --> 02:26:23,500
I know, I know you're not, I understand that.

1710
02:26:23,633 --> 02:26:24,600
I'm not, I don't understand.

1711
02:26:24,633 --> 02:26:26,866
Yeah, yeah, I understand, I understand.

1712
02:26:31,033 --> 02:26:41,066
My observation has been that if There's a tight relationship, and if one party is betrayed by the other in that manner, that it's almost always irreconcilable.

1713
02:26:41,633 --> 02:26:42,233
It breaks it.

1714
02:26:43,633 --> 02:26:47,400
And, you know, I've helped people try to struggle through that.

1715
02:26:47,900 --> 02:26:51,766
On both sides of it, the person who was betrayed and the person who did the betrayal.

1716
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:58,200
I've seen people grow up and not do it again, and this was in situations where their partner didn't know.

1717
02:26:59,033 --> 02:27:06,466
And in a couple of those situations, it seemed to me that it might have even been a necessary learning experience for the person who did it.

1718
02:27:06,966 --> 02:27:09,666
You know, it helped them develop.

1719
02:27:09,666 --> 02:27:14,233
That doesn't mean I'm justifying it, but life is complicated.

1720
02:27:14,800 --> 02:27:25,300
But I think that society works better, all things considered, when you make a promise and you stick to it.

1721
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:30,133
And, one of the things I learned from reading Jung, which I really liked, was

1722
02:27:32,233 --> 02:27:33,400
You know, he believed that

1723
02:27:34,700 --> 02:27:38,600
And he had his affairs too, so you might think about it as somewhat hypocritical, but

1724
02:27:40,366 --> 02:27:44,966
But I think that people can make mistakes without having what they think necessarily be wrong

1725
02:27:46,033 --> 02:27:50,366
You know, he said that there are things in a marriage that you can't have unless you're all in

1726
02:27:51,700 --> 02:27:53,433
And I believe that, I believe that

1727
02:27:54,166 --> 02:27:59,133
So if there's a back door open or that like to begin with or a back door opens

1728
02:27:59,266 --> 02:28:05,566
Then I think that there's something about the relationship that is lacking at least and I think you pay a big price for that

1729
02:28:06,900 --> 02:28:15,133
so I mean it depends on whether you regard a marriage as a Practical arrangement or a spiritual arrangement now really it's both.

1730
02:28:15,133 --> 02:28:16,666
You know both are important

1731
02:28:18,033 --> 02:28:28,000
But if it's a spiritual arrangement or a psychological arrangement above all then I do think that you don't get the transformation without being all-in and

1732
02:28:28,433 --> 02:28:47,600
if you violate it then even if you can work it out with your partner there's something that you will never get as a consequence so last question okay I hope

1733
02:28:47,666 --> 02:28:52,266
I'll make this good thanks also for continuing the lecture series I haven't

1734
02:28:52,366 --> 02:29:00,433
listened to all of the lectures but it seems like you focus very much on the appeal of the biblical stories to the individual psychology.

1735
02:29:01,066 --> 02:29:07,700
Do you have any thoughts on the relative importance of crowd psychology to the appeal and staying power of the Bible and also the

1736
02:29:08,700 --> 02:29:15,766
reason why the Bible or the biblical stories took precedence over other ideologies which could have taken its place?

1737
02:29:17,100 --> 02:29:25,700
Okay, well let's go to the second one first.

1738
02:29:25,733 --> 02:29:28,533
I think it's the same thing that happens when someone

1739
02:29:28,700 --> 02:29:32,766
One both creates and edits a great movie

1740
02:29:35,033 --> 02:29:39,000
It's no one knows like imagine how many choices are there in a great movie

1741
02:29:39,100 --> 02:29:44,066
Let's say it's an animated movie because absolutely everything in an animated movie is constructed everything

1742
02:29:44,766 --> 02:29:48,933
There's God only knows how many choices like maybe there's millions of choices

1743
02:29:49,933 --> 02:29:58,533
you know and each choice is guided by some intuition of Narrative suitability or beauty or there's some higher ideal

1744
02:29:59,133 --> 02:30:02,300
Motivating it right the desire to produce a masterpiece

1745
02:30:02,500 --> 02:30:08,666
Maybe that's it that was certainly the case with the Disney movies for example and so that that aspiration then then

1746
02:30:11,066 --> 02:30:13,433
Makes the decisions and so I would say well

1747
02:30:14,733 --> 02:30:20,800
Something like that guided the writing and the selection of the stories in in the biblical Canon now

1748
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:24,633
Now, could have there been other stories included?

1749
02:30:24,733 --> 02:30:29,633
Well, the Catholics and the Protestants don't have the same biblical tradition, and neither do the Jews and the Christians.

1750
02:30:29,733 --> 02:30:33,733
And so, it isn't exactly clear what to make of that, you know?

1751
02:30:34,033 --> 02:30:39,066
I mean, that's akin in some sense to the discussion we just had about Islam and Christianity.

1752
02:30:42,733 --> 02:30:49,233
In some sense, I've left that aside, that specific question, except in so far as I've just answered.

1753
02:30:49,300 --> 02:30:56,233
because I'm trying to take what we have, which I know is at the root of our culture, and to figure out what it is that we have.

1754
02:30:57,400 --> 02:31:06,933
Why it is that we have it, well I made some attempt to explain that in the manner that I just described, but I don't have a final answer.

1755
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:08,600
Could it have been different?

1756
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,466
It could have been different at some levels, but the same at others.

1757
02:31:15,400 --> 02:31:25,233
You know, I mean, one of the things that scholars of comparative religion, who haven't been infected fatally with postmodernism, have definitely realized, so Jung, for example,

1758
02:31:25,333 --> 02:31:30,133
and Eliade, and people who are interested in grand narratives, one of the things they

1759
02:31:30,300 --> 02:31:40,100
pointed out quite clearly is that there's a set of common mythological themes across many cultures, and I tried to outline that in Maps of Meaning, and that worked out quite nicely,

1760
02:31:40,233 --> 02:31:44,800
for me at least, as far as I was concerned, because once I had the basic archetypal structure

1761
02:31:44,933 --> 02:31:48,466
Mapped out it opened up all sorts of stories to me from all sorts of different cultures

1762
02:31:49,133 --> 02:31:54,066
And that's been unbelievably useful like the mesopotamian story of it the anuma elish

1763
02:31:54,600 --> 02:32:03,066
When I figured out what that meant as far as I was concerned like I've never forgotten that it just seared itself into my memory and the same with the Egyptian stories

1764
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:08,866
And you know some buddhist writings that I've read in some the dow teaching is also very powerful

1765
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:13,466
So I think that things can be different on one level and the same at another

1766
02:32:13,900 --> 02:32:25,800
But that humanity kind of coalesces on what's the same over a reasonable period of time because there isn't that many ways that human beings can live properly as individuals and as groups together

1767
02:32:26,933 --> 02:32:31,666
And so there's this constant force that makes our ethical presuppositions converge

1768
02:32:32,233 --> 02:32:35,433
And then that's automatically expressed in the stories.

1769
02:32:35,466 --> 02:32:36,766
It's something like that now.

1770
02:32:36,800 --> 02:32:38,900
It's an imperfect process, and it's full of error

1771
02:32:39,933 --> 02:32:40,066
so

1772
02:32:42,533 --> 02:32:49,166
Yeah, so

1773
02:32:50,533 --> 02:32:52,000
Just one announcement

1774
02:32:52,666 --> 02:32:54,800
Well two announcements the next lecture.

1775
02:32:54,833 --> 02:32:55,766
I believe is November 14th

1776
02:32:56,300 --> 02:32:59,366
So I'll hopefully finish off the story of Jacob looks like it

1777
02:33:00,066 --> 02:33:05,200
And then I'm also appearing on a panel with Gad Saad and or an amity on

1778
02:33:05,800 --> 02:33:09,533
November 11th, and there's still quite a few tickets available for that

1779
02:33:09,766 --> 02:33:13,766
So if you're interested you could go to my website and pick up those tickets.

1780
02:33:13,800 --> 02:33:15,300
It should be well.

1781
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:16,433
Hopefully it'll be interesting

1782
02:33:16,500 --> 02:33:18,766
I think it will be and might be too interesting

1783
02:33:19,933 --> 02:33:21,033
That's one possibility

1784
02:33:22,266 --> 02:33:25,633
So we'll see but I'm going to do two more of these this year

1785
02:33:26,266 --> 02:33:28,600
And I hope I get through the story of Joseph

1786
02:33:28,700 --> 02:33:31,266
And then I can start in the new year with it with exodus

1787
02:33:31,466 --> 02:33:36,900
And that's a story that I know quite well and the exodus and leviticus, and what's the one after that?

1788
02:33:38,333 --> 02:33:39,066
Yes, thank you

1789
02:33:40,066 --> 02:33:43,900
so I'm very much looking forward to that because that is one killer story man, so and

1790
02:33:44,466 --> 02:33:47,266
And I've got some surprises for that as well, so

1791
02:33:47,933 --> 02:33:52,100
Anyways, thank you very much for coming, and hopefully we'll see you November 14th

1792
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,233
非常感谢

1793
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:36,566
非常感谢您再次出现

1794
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:39,366
看到大家都来了 真的很高兴

1795
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:51,366
因此 我意识到一个事情 那就是这些故事的影响 它们在多大程度上关于个体 这一点非常显著 我认为这很有意义

1796
00:00:51,466 --> 00:01:00,400
它们在多大程度上是关于个体的 这一点相当不同寻常 我认为这非常值得关注

1797
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,200
现在 我之所以更喜欢陀思妥耶夫斯基而不是托尔斯泰 是因为

1798
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:10,400
托尔斯泰更像是一个社会学家 他更感兴趣的是人群之间的关系

1799
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:14,333
这是一种简化的说法 因为显然托尔斯泰是一位伟大的作者 但是

1800
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:20,400
我更喜欢陀思妥耶夫斯基 因为他真的深入到个体的灵魂中 我认为这很了不起

1801
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:30,133
到目前为止 我们在《创世纪》中所覆盖的所有故事都在多大程度上是关于个体的

1802
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,733
它们相当现实 这也非常不同寻常

1803
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:42,266
它们并没有被过分浪漫化 因为所有被视为《创世纪》中的父权或母权人物

1804
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:49,666
他们都有不少的道德缺陷 也面临着生活中的不少困难

1805
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,366
而且这些困难是现实的

1806
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:59,400
它们是大问题  像家庭灾难、饥荒、战争、报复、仇恨等等

1807
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:06,366
这不是一本美丽的书 这也是它伟大的原因之一

1808
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:15,333
我的意思是 这是伟大文学的特征之一 对吧 它不会向你呈现一种粉饰的人性或存在观

1809
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,966
这确实是一种解脱

1810
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:20,766
我认为这是因为 如你们所知 因为你们活着

1811
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:30,700
这里没有对存在的粉饰 活着就意味着在道德和存在上遇到困苦

1812
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,033
我最近在读这本书

1813
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:37,366
稍后我会稍微谈谈它

1814
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,733
它的名字叫做《最好未曾存在》

1815
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,833
这本书是由一位在南非开普敦的哲学家本纳塔尔写的

1816
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:46,833
这是他的姓氏

1817
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,133
他基本上是在证明这一点

1818
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,900
我认为这是一个似是而非的论点 我认为它是人为构建的

1819
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,433
但他基本上是在证明这一点

1820
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,800
因为生活充满了苦难

1821
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,633
即使是好的生活也充满了苦难 以至于

1822
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:11,366
（会认为）把孩子带到这个世界上是错误的 因为苦难超过了好处 即使在好的生活中也是如此

1823
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:17,066
这实际上是错误的 出于完全相同的原因 最好不要存在

1824
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,000
我在读这本书时的感觉是 他先得出了结论 然后才写这本书来为其辩护

1825
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:28,400
实际上 这与你应该如何写书的方式相反 当你写书时 你应该...

1826
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:32,133
应该有一个问题 它应该是一个真正的问题 对吧

1827
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,900
它应该是你不知道答案的问题

1828
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,866
然后你应该像疯了一样地研究、写作并阅读你能够找到的所有东西

1829
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,733
看看你是否真的能够解决这个问题并得出某种解决方案

1830
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:49,166
你还应该让读者跟随你的思考过程 这样他们也能到达

1831
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:54,400
（他们）不一定得出相同的结论 但至少能够跟踪你在做什么 我认为他没有这样做

1832
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:59,166
我认为他是倒着写的 所以我想了很多 因为

1833
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,266
因为 这实际上是我在写作时一直在思考的问题

1834
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,233
例如 在歌德的《浮士德》中有魔鬼或撒旦人物

1835
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,600
还有在《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》中的伊万 他们基本上提出了同样的论点

1836
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:23,500
存在充满了艰难和苦难 如果根本不存在会更好

1837
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:27,600
我对此有问题 问题有很多

1838
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,566
但其中一个问题是 如果你开始这样思考 会发生什么

1839
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:36,966
因为 我观察到的是 开始这样思考的人并不会止步于此

1840
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,166
像 他们对存在感到愤怒 就像我们在该隐和亚伯故事中看到的那样

1841
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,900
然后 下一步是开始对存在进行报复 这种情况会逐渐升级 直至报复...

1842
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,266
嗯 我认为最好的理解方式是 因为存在的罪行 对上帝进行报复

1843
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,133
我认为 这是你可以怀有的最深层次的仇恨

1844
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,066
当你处于一种非常深刻的情感中 比如一个非常深刻的情感 就在情感的最底层

1845
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:05,100
你处于某种状态

1846
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,766
这就像一种准宗教状态 这在很大程度上与你是否相信某个超越的神祇无关

1847
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,733
我的意思是 你可以处于一种深刻的情感状态

1848
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:20,466
这种状态深刻至极 并且可以具有宗教意义 而这不必意味着任何关于超越存在的事情

1849
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:21,366
但是

1850
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,266
但后来我在思考 你看 这个论点的问题是你可以无限地调整它

1851
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,233
的 首先 你如何衡量苦难和幸福

1852
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,033
就像 你如何给它们分配权重

1853
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,866
根本就没有办法做到

1854
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,200
你必须武断地做这件事

1855
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:44,100
因此 你可以提出一个论点 认为苦难超过了幸福 你只是把苦难的权重放得比幸福的权重重

1856
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:46,933
就这样结束了  所以这是个问题

1857
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:57,266
但是 我认为还有一个更深层的问题 我之前也读了另一本书

1858
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:02,733
是那个负责人类基因组项目的人写的 我不完全记得它叫什么了

1859
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:06,766
但它的名字类似于一个科学家为上帝的辩护 或类似的东西

1860
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,200
他提到的其中一件事

1861
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:15,300
起初没有给我留下深刻印象 是他认为其中一个现象

1862
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:23,900
也就是人类的道德直觉 可以作为相信超越存在的理由

1863
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:31,133
我们有对“是非”的感觉  《创世记》中亚当和夏娃的故事就是

1864
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:38,733
宣布了对“是非”知识的到来 即善恶知识 这不是我们归因于动物的东西

1865
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,600
这是独特于人类的 动物可以是捕食者 它们可以是温柔的

1866
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:53,833
你可以与它们建立关系 但你永远不会认为有邪恶的猫 或者 即使它们是捕食性的 也不会是邪恶的狼

1867
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,533
但人类 我们有这个能力在善与恶、是与非之间做出判断

1868
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:08,133
这确实是我们存在的一个不可分割的部分 我认为你可以为此提出一个进化的案例 一个生物学的案例

1869
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:16,866
就像你可以为人类大多数相关特性提出生物学案例一样 因为我们是生物体 但是

1870
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,200
我们真的不理解这一点的重要性 比如《创世记》中亚当和夏娃的故事

1871
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,300
那是一个转变 即意识到善恶知识实际上被表现为具有宇宙意义 对吧

1872
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:33,200
它在存在的结构中造成了一个永久的裂缝

1873
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:41,133
如果你认为人类是无足轻重的 仅仅是在一个无限宇宙中的微小尘埃上的蚂蚁

1874
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:50,466
一个对我们不闻不问的宇宙 根本不在乎人类是否具有区分善恶的知识

1875
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:55,466
但如果你给意识在存在中赋予一个核心角色 你可以完全合理地提出这样的辩护

1876
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,533
因为就目前任何人能够确定的来说 没有意识就没有存在

1877
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,400
所以它可能比我们认为的更为核心 我真的认为没有反对这个观点的论证

1878
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,233
至少 没有一个坚固的论证

1879
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:16,500
你可以说意识是附带现象 世界根本上是唯物主义的 意识的存在不重要

1880
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:20,033
你可以这么说 但你也可以同样可信地提出相反的论点

1881
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:26,100
当然 我们的生活经验是意识至关重要 显然

1882
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:34,966
我们相互对待彼此 （以这样一种方式）就像大多数时间我们是有价值的有意识的存在 即使意识经常伴随着苦难 我们也不会放弃我们的意识

1883
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:42,933
所以我认为这本书的另一个问题是 它基于一种观念 即生活是为了幸福

1884
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:47,466
我不认为这是正确的 我不认为人们这样体验生活

1885
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:56,533
我可能错了 但在我看来 人们体验生活就像是一系列关键的道德决策

1886
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,133
就是这样

1887
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:11,233
我的意思是 也许我对此有点天真 但我无法想象 我无法想象另一个与我在大多数方面相似的存在

1888
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:19,766
（无法想象）他没有在一直在斗争 为下一步正确的行为而斗争

1889
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,300
这不是显而易见的 它并不显然 这并不意味着你会做正确的事

1890
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,966
因为你很多时候都不会 这一点 因为你的自我判断 因为你一直在犯错

1891
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,600
有时你不知道你在做什么 也许这是一个错误 也许不是 谁能说这不是...

1892
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,966
我在谈论的是 当你正在做的事情是错误的时候

1893
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,733
即便做某事是错误的 你还是会去做 人们总是这样做

1894
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:46,033
这也是极其特别的 你会认为 如果它是错误的

1895
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:50,766
并且你告诉自己那是错误的 那本应该足够让你不去做它

1896
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:54,700
但实际上你根本不是那样的  你可以50次告诉自己某事是错误的

1897
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:04,466
你可能第51次还是会做 然后你会感到 就像你应该感到的那样 但这并不能阻止你 所以

1898
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:15,033
所以我认为这种观点的另一个问题 即生活的苦难抵消了它的价值 是因为它基于这样一个观念

1899
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:25,233
即幸福 或者甚至是缺乏苦难 是评判生活的正确标准 我不认为我们实际上是这样体验生活的

1900
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:31,533
我认为我们实际上是让自己经历一系列痛苦的道德选择

1901
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:41,533
 圣经故事中一个非常重要的方面 我认为整个隐含的哲学

1902
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:49,666
嵌入在故事中的是 生活就是以这种方式呈现的 在故事中就是所有这些

1903
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,100
首先他们是个体 不是群体 其次他们一直在为他们的道德选择煎熬 一直都是 他们与上帝有关系 但那并不是全部

1904
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:12,166
这不是指令性的关系 即便是上帝直接对话的人们--我怀疑这并不是你特别希望发生的事--

1905
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,366
即使他们与上帝有直接的关系 也无法阻止他们不断被自己的道德选择所折磨

1906
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:28,233
因此 这个世界被呈现为一个道德景观

1907
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,466
不是一个幸福不证自明的地方

1908
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:39,466
它被呈现为一个道德景观 人们被呈现为穿越这个道德景观的生物

1909
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:44,266
通过做出伦理决定来决定世界的走向

1910
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,733
在我看来 这是正确的 这与幸福完全不同 根本就是两回事

1911
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:57,100
这是一种完全不同的存在范畴  然后我思考了很多

1912
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:06,566
我认为 我们确实在做选择 我们所做的就是与未来抗争  而未来似乎呈现为一种可能性的领域

1913
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:15,566
相比于“未来被呈现为一系列确定事物” 这是一种更准确的思考方式

1914
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:20,433
它呈现为一种可能性领域 在这个领域中有好的选择

1915
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:23,633
也有糟糕的选择 甚至是邪恶的选择

1916
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:29,800
我们不断地谈判 决定哪些选择我们将实现

1917
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,100
在我看来 这是无可争议的现象学事实 我们确实将彼此视为这样做

1918
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:40,533
因为我们对彼此的行为负责 当然也有一些例外

1919
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:50,766
我们在每一刻都在决定是让事情变得更好还是更糟 这在我看来是正确的

1920
00:12:51,966 --> 00:13:00,833
我认为这就是这些故事所描绘的 它们并不直接这样说 尽管我认为随着叙述的展开 这变得越来越明显

1921
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,100
但故事的现实主义部分就是

1922
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:11,433
被呈现的这些角色绝不是好人

1923
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,366
我的意思是 也许诺亚除外 诺亚看起来是个不错的家伙

1924
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:22,633
好吧 他确实喝醉了  最终裸体暴露在他儿子面前等等

1925
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:27,100
但他作为一个角色并没有被过多讨论

1926
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:33,400
这是一个相当简洁的故事 但亚伯拉罕 亚伯拉罕有很多问题 其中最大的问题之一就是他无法离开家

1927
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:39,900
然后 他对他的妻子撒谎 犯了各种错误 接下来我们要讲的雅各

1928
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:45,866
是一个道德上更加模棱两可的角色

1929
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,933
特别是在故事的开始

1930
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:55,266
他不是你会特别挑选出来的那种人

1931
00:13:56,633 --> 00:14:00,600
尤其是如果你是个平庸的作家 你不会把他选作故事的英雄

1932
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:07,200
他做了很多真的相当可恶的事情 他花了很长时间才学会变得更好

1933
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,333
然而他被推崇为以色列的十二个部落的父亲

1934
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:16,400
正是从这个有缺陷的人那里 那些人

1935
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:24,900
也许 你可以说 他们的故事构成了我们文化的基础

1936
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:29,866
正是从这个深度有缺陷的个体那里 那个群体出现了

1937
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:39,733
因此 你可能会认为这也是一种安慰 因为你不是一个穿着闪亮盔甲的骑士 拥有纯洁的道德过去

1938
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:44,633
我的意思是 人们不断犯下灾难性的错误

1939
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,900
这也意味着这些故事提出了某种接近希望的东西

1940
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:57,100
因为在他们的现实主义 他们的道德现实主义中 他们呈现了英雄

1941
00:14:57,266 --> 00:15:07,700
著名的英雄 对 古时候的族长 比如说 他们是现实的人 他们有情绪激动和愤怒发作的时刻 有时候甚至会因此杀人

1942
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:19,833
并且他们深深地卷入家族纷争中 并且他们有通奸事件 像 他们做了人们会做的所有可怕的事情

1943
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:24,000
奇怪的是 上帝仍然与他们同在 而且

1944
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:31,333
这并不明显 即它意味着什么 或者即使它意味着什么

1945
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:38,133
但据我所知 这是不可争议的 那就是我们有意识 而且

1946
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,700
意识是一种我们不理解的超越现象 我们穿越的景观是道德的 就像你看过的每一个故事

1947
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,433
在屏幕上或在剧院里看任何吸引你想象力的东西 任何吸引你的故事

1948
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,533
都是道德奋斗的故事

1949
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:56,700
否则就没意思

1950
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,700
对 人必须面对复杂的道德选择

1951
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:05,800
然后你看到结果  好人做得对 坏人做得不好

1952
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:12,200
事情对坏人通常不会那么顺利 如果更复杂的话 （那就是）好和坏会出现在同一个个体中

1953
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,766
这知道 这是一个更吸引人的故事

1954
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:15,800
但是

1955
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:26,833
因此我们可以说 那让我们可以假设 将世界视为一个--

1956
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:36,633
如同古典所思--作为善与恶力量不断争夺主导权的舞台可能是值得的 而我

1957
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:47,000
尤其是在我开始深入阅读20世纪的历史以及20世纪发生的所有可怕事情和人们彼此间做出的所有难以置信的可恶的事情后

1958
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:55,400
我就无法以其他任何现实的方式来看待事情

1959
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:06,200
因为我认为你不可能即熟知20世纪的历史 而又不得出恶是现实的结论 如果它是现实的

1960
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:11,100
这取决于你对现实的定义 但对我来说它足够基本的现实

1961
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,633
如果它是现实 那么我不明白你如何能逃避这样的结论

1962
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:21,866
至少我们所经历的宇宙 是一个道德奋斗的地方

1963
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,466
而 这正是雅各故事中真正描绘的内容之一 我觉得这相当惊人

1964
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:45,233
所以 上次 上一讲 我以撒拉的死结束了亚伯拉罕的故事 那是亚伯拉罕的妻子

1965
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,966
所以我们将从那里继续 记得亚伯拉罕有一个儿子以撒

1966
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:59,000
上帝要求他牺牲自己的儿子 我们已经深入讨论过

1967
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:06,100
我试图阐述的是 牺牲的概念是人类伟大的发现之一 因为

1968
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,733
这本质上意味着发现未来

1969
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:15,433
但这也意味着发现了未来是你可以与之交易的东西 你可以放弃一些东西

1970
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:22,066
现在的某些冲动 某种快乐 即使是瞬间的深刻快乐 你可以奋斗并且

1971
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,666
假设你可以与未来订立一个契约 一个交易 如果你的牺牲是可接受的

1972
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:37,500
这似乎意味着道德上可接受 你必须牺牲正确的东西 那将大大增加你不仅会成功的可能性

1973
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:44,866
比方说 而且你的后代也会如此 我认为这不是一个非理性的提议

1974
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:48,400
我的意思是 你必须稍微意识到 有时

1975
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:54,500
不管怎样你都可能被砍断膝盖 因为生活有其随意性元素 而且

1976
00:18:55,433 --> 00:19:01,700
这不能被忽视 但在考虑随意性元素时 你仍然想要思考

1977
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:08,500
在一定程度的随机性下 你的最佳选择是什么 我认为有意识的、自我意识的牺牲和

1978
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:14,766
恰当的道德努力是你的最佳选择 还有另一个想法

1979
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:32,233
当我向人们解释时 我总是用《匹诺曹》这部电影作为例子  当杰佩托试图将他的木偶变成一个有自我意识和自主道德的施动者的时候

1980
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,800
这是他最想要的 他朝着他能想象到的最高善去努力

1981
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:44,066
那就是他实质上祈祷的星星 并且希望转变 这里面也有某种难以言喻的深刻意义

1982
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:50,433
也许这在某种程度上独立于你必须相信上帝的想法

1983
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:58,500
我还会说 在旧约中相信上帝的意义绝不明确 这也是今晚我真正想要谈论的内容

1984
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:11,066
它的意义不明显 至少杰佩托所做的是朝着他能想象到的最高善去努力 而这实际上是关于上帝的哲学定义之一

1985
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,900
即上帝是你能想象到的最高善 而且

1986
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:28,166
这与超越存在的想法不同 但它与某些有趣的精神分析推测相符

1987
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:30,433
这是我真正喜欢卡尔·荣格的一点

1988
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:32,733
荣格是如此激进的思想家

1989
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:35,300
简直就是 我读过很多批评荣格的文章

1990
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:43,333
我总是从中得到乐趣 因为他们指责荣格的事情与荣格实际做过的事情相比是如此微不足道

1991
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:47,200
这就像指责一个杀人犯违反交规一样

1992
00:20:47,233 --> 00:20:50,000
因为荣格实在是太激进了

1993
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,033
比如 他的一个观点是 他认为这是必要的

1994
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:59,000
他相信心理治疗可以被最高道德努力所取代

1995
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,166
所以道德努力会是像朝着“善”的目标前进然后试图围绕那个整合自己

1996
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:16,566
而你所追求的善会是某种接近于 如果你展现了你的全部潜能 你会变成什么样子

1997
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:23,866
而你会对那个完整潜能有一个隐约的认识 那会是潜在的未来的你 他认为人是四维实体

1998
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:31,000
特别是基本上被拉伸在时间上的实体 而你作为一个整体跨越时间包括你的潜能

1999
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:36,066
也在此刻此地展现了自己 而你的潜能的一部分

2000
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,966
通过类似良知或直觉的声音展现出来

2001
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,833
这是惊人的想法

2002
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:51,300
这真是个惊人的想法 因为就像你未来的可能性在当下向你召唤并且帮助你区分善与恶

2003
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,133
这是一个令人难以置信的想法 我认为

2004
00:21:55,366 --> 00:22:06,633
这是一个你必须面对的想法 然后他比这更进一步 这也是一个了不起的想法

2005
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:17,733
他对基督的象征性表现感兴趣 我是说从心理学角度来看 他将基督视为理想潜能人的代表 有点像那样

2006
00:22:17,866 --> 00:22:26,333
所以这至少是象征性的 至少基督就是人类理想潜能的象征性表现 所以对荣格来说 没有区别

2007
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:39,700
在心理上 你未来可能成为的人对你的召唤 与当前的祈祷和与基督心理上的定位是同一回事

2008
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:45,700
那么 这是一个非常令人震惊的想法 真的 这是一个非常令人震惊的想法

2009
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:51,166
特别是当你加上心理学观点 其中之一是

2010
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:58,766
表征你理想未来自我的能力就是能够进行牺牲 对 而且越深入的牺牲越好 然后还能从中恢复

2011
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:02,566
从牺牲中恢复 对 那就是死亡和重生 所以你的一部分

2012
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:07,100
对你作为一个完全绽放的存在 最本质的是

2013
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:14,400
你放下事物的能力然后从中恢复 所以在某种意义上死去并为更高的善服务重生

2014
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:19,800
然后 那么下一部分是

2015
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,533
世界的方向取决于你这样做

2016
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:29,333
所以不仅是你自己的生活 还有你家人的生活 因为我们是如此紧密地相连

2017
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:36,866
 整个人类乃至宇宙的结构 你可能会想 嗯

2018
00:23:37,066 --> 00:23:40,000
不 但 事情并没有那么简单

2019
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,800
事情并没有那么简单

2020
00:23:42,766 --> 00:23:45,066
首先 一个人可以造成很大的破坏

2021
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,966
这是毫无疑问的 随着我们技术上变得更加强大

2022
00:23:50,966 --> 00:23:56,033
这变得更加相关、重要、并且至关重要 荣格说的其中一件事是我们必须觉醒

2023
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:03,933
因为我们在技术上太强大了 不能像现在这样道德上沉睡 这对我来说似乎是不言自明的

2024
00:24:03,966 --> 00:24:04,833
那是 当然

2025
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,500
那是真的

2026
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,266
我们持有核武器却半梦半醒

2027
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,533
这不是个好主意

2028
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,033
真的不是个好主意 而且

2029
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:12,966
所以

2030
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:24,733
那么 你可能也会问自己  一个完全发展的人的终极潜能是什么

2031
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:31,366
嗯 我们当然知道你对那些比较成熟的人而非较少成熟的人有一种钦佩

2032
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:37,566
这是自然发生的 或者是嫉妒 但那没关系 这是同一回事 不重要

2033
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:41,333
但并不是你不能识别他们 你可以识别他们

2034
00:24:41,766 --> 00:24:45,866
他们在戏剧和小说中不断地呈现给你

2035
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:48,400
所以 这是另一种形式的道德直觉

2036
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:51,866
你可以分辨出好坏 可以这么说

2037
00:24:52,966 --> 00:25:06,233
所以 我还在思考的另一件值得考虑的事是...

2038
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:10,533
也许这看起来小题大做 但我不这么认为

2039
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:14,766
有人前几天问我是否相信奇迹

2040
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,200
我不喜欢被问这样的问题

2041
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,300
并且

2042
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:25,600
人们也问我是否相信上帝 我不知道他们说这话时是什么意思

2043
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,966
所以我不知道该怎么回答 因为我不认为我们必然在谈论同一件事

2044
00:25:30,066 --> 00:25:35,700
但无论如何 我说是的 我有多种原因 但其中之一是

2045
00:25:38,566 --> 00:25:49,233
物理学家之间的共识是 我们可以追踪到宇宙的起源 大约在大爆炸之后的百万分之一百万秒

2046
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:55,700
这与大爆炸如此接近 以至于差别实际上是无穷小的

2047
00:25:56,433 --> 00:26:02,166
但共识是 在那之前 不管那是什么 物理定律本身就崩溃了

2048
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:09,900
那么 你怎么称呼一个存在于物理定律之外的事件呢

2049
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,333
按定义 那就是一个奇迹

2050
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,833
现在 这不一定意味着有一个超越的神造成了这个事件

2051
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,000
那是一个单独的问题

2052
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:27,966
但这确实暗示了某种障碍 我们无法越过 某种其他规则适用的地方

2053
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:31,566
所以 我也觉得这很有趣

2054
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:32,833
所以

2055
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:37,666
好的

2056
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:55,500
所以撒拉去世后 亚伯拉罕与赫梯人达成协议 为她购买了一个安葬之地 他们提出赠送 但他坚持要付费

2057
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:06,400
这是一个小故事 基本上表明了两件事 亚伯拉罕是那种你一见就相信的人 而且 即使某样东西被当作礼物提供给他

2058
00:27:06,533 --> 00:27:14,500
他还是会尽一切努力做到回报 所以这不是故事中极其重要的部分

2059
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:18,800
但这与同一叙事流程保持一致 所以

2060
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:24,200
赫梯人以弗仑提出赠送一个安葬之地 而亚伯拉罕说不

2061
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:29,333
你得让我付费 以弗仑说他愿意 结果非常好

2062
00:27:29,766 --> 00:27:33,533
于是他为他的妻子找到了一个好的安葬之地

2063
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:53,100
然后亚伯拉罕决定以撒需要一个妻子 所以他派他的长子仆人到美索不达米亚去为以撒寻找妻子 然后进行了一个奇怪的仪式

2064
00:27:53,100 --> 00:28:02,100
故事中说仆人将手放在亚伯拉罕的大腿下宣誓 但那并不是真正的意思

2065
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:04,266
意思是他将手放在...

2066
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,500
我不知道该怎么恰当地说这个

2067
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:09,333
好吧 发挥你的想象

2068
00:28:09,366 --> 00:28:10,000
怎么样

2069
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:16,266
据我所知 这个想法是他对未来宣誓

2070
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,633
他对未来的人们宣誓

2071
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,866
就是这样的意思

2072
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,833
所以这就是“作证”意味着的 对吧

2073
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,600
想想它的根源

2074
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:23,400
好吧 我不是在开玩笑

2075
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:25,066
我没有开玩笑

2076
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,166
这就是它...

2077
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:28,133
这就是它的来源 对吧

2078
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:36,733
是的 这是一个严肃的问题 所以那个仆人必须去为以撒找到一个好的妻子

2079
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:49,666
他希望为以撒找到一个愿意接受相同基本信仰体系的妻子 这大概就是相信一个统一而非多元的上帝的信念

2080
00:28:49,733 --> 00:29:04,000
荣格非常坚持的另一点是 多神教与心理混乱以及一神教与心理统一之间存在关系

2081
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:07,200
我也非常喜欢这个想法  那就是

2082
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:13,366
因为你是一个多元体 这是心理分析家们真正擅长的发现之一

2083
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:19,200
认为你是由子人格组成 它们都有自己的欲望、

2084
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:25,400
自己的观点、自己的思想、自己的感知 它们之间不断地进行着战斗

2085
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:31,733
也许甚至是一场达尔文式的战争 某些神经科学家就这样描述

2086
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:37,966
这被某些神经科学家描绘成一种方式

2087
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:51,633
其中生活的目标之一是将所有这些多元 整合到一个层级伦理结构中 其中有某种典范伦理处于其顶点 对吗

2088
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:57,900
我们已经稍微谈过这个话题 什么应该处于顶点并不明显 但我们可以猜测它

2089
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,133
那就是我们所钦佩的（东西）

2090
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,433
这是一种思考方式

2091
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,266
那是描述在一系列游戏中公平竞争的东西

2092
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,866
这是另一种好的思考方式

2093
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,366
那是英雄理想

2094
00:30:10,366 --> 00:30:11,766
那是另一种思考方式

2095
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:18,866
但它结合了慷慨 因为神话中的英雄前往未知领域 击败龙 获得黄金

2096
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,366
然后返回社会 分享所得

2097
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,366
所以这是勇气加上慷慨

2098
00:30:27,266 --> 00:30:36,500
所以你所有的内在斗争都是尝试用挑战来与世界碰撞

2099
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:43,366
不断地像锤打铁一样把一切凝聚在一起 以此来治愈它

2100
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,733
可以这么说 所以

2101
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:48,033
你不会是内在的矛盾

2102
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:55,733
你不会是一群相互争斗的神 因为那样心理上太有压力也让其他人难以忍受 而且

2103
00:30:56,133 --> 00:31:01,400
如果你一会儿是一种人 另一会儿是另一种人 别人就无法和你相处 所以

2104
00:31:03,633 --> 00:31:11,566
所以无论如何 亚伯拉罕坚持要以撒从可能延续一神教传统的人中找到妻子

2105
00:31:11,966 --> 00:31:18,966
我不确定一神教传统实际上是否与个人主义传统不可分割

2106
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,666
我认为它们可能在不同的分析层面上是相同的

2107
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,933
因为个体在某种意义上意味着不可分割 对吧

2108
00:31:28,966 --> 00:31:41,133
成为一个个体意味着成为一件事 而另一件抵制将生活视为幸福的观点的事情是 我并不明显认为是幸福塑造和形成你的东西

2109
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,233
它更像是自愿承担的最佳挑战

2110
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,200
就是这样的东西

2111
00:31:46,733 --> 00:31:46,833
对吧

2112
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:56,400
我认为这在“每个人都有道德义务承担自己的十字架”这一观点中有所体现 某种程度上 接受自己的死亡事实

2113
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,766
我相信情况确实如此

2114
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,266
我确实认为这是适当心理发展的先决条件 因为

2115
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:09,266
如果你不愿意自愿面对你的死亡 比如如果你在不断地抗拒和对抗

2116
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:16,233
--而你有充分的理由这么做 别误会我的意思--那么你就无法在世界上坦率地行动

2117
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:25,866
你会感到害怕 当你感到害怕时 你就无法自愿接受挑战 如果你不能自愿接受挑战 那么你就无法发展

2118
00:32:26,133 --> 00:32:34,800
所以再次 生活似乎是某种程度上 如果是恰当的生活 就是自愿接受重大挑战

2119
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:39,033
也许这比幸福更好 它肯定更高尚

2120
00:32:39,066 --> 00:32:40,433
“高尚”这个词

2121
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:45,066
我们现在很少使用了 因为我们太迷恋幸福了

2122
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:48,966
但我认为幸福是 如果它降临 那太好了

2123
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:55,200
太棒了 不要轻视它或认为理所当然 因为它是短暂的

2124
00:32:55,833 --> 00:33:00,600
但认为那是你应该追求的 从某种意义上说 我觉得……

2125
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,966
如果那是生活的目的 那也许它不应该是

2126
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:04,800
也许这是对的

2127
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,866
因为那不是生活的本质

2128
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:10,733
但它也不明显……我不确定那是生活应该是的

2129
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:15,466
我的意思是 如果你真的爱某个人 比如说你的儿子

2130
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:22,066
你会说我希望他有一个幸福的生活 还是你会说我希望他取得伟大成就

2131
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,966
在我看来 取得伟大成就更好

2132
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:32,466
因为那是值得钦佩的  一个快乐的人是快乐的 但是

2133
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,866
一个高尚的人是一个值得钦佩的人 那更好 伙计

2134
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:40,366
所以也许有比幸福更好的东西

2135
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,033
所以你不能根据痛苦与快乐的比例来判断存在

2136
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:49,266
我不认为我们会这样做

2137
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:54,233
我不相信我们会这样做 我的意思是 喜剧演员是快乐的 对 但并不是每个人都渴望成为喜剧演员

2138
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:59,333
即使你看喜剧时几乎不停地笑 如果喜剧演员很有趣的话

2139
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,033
但 你想要投入到某些事情中 我也这么认为

2140
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:04,966
这是其中一个原因

2141
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,866
我喜欢存在主义哲学是因为

2142
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,700
存在主义者相信这是一种原罪的观念

2143
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:17,200
他们认为我们带着一种伦理负担进入这个世界 类似这样

2144
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:22,766
我们有一种感觉 认为我们有必要为我们的存在进行辩护 而如果我们不做到这一点

2145
00:34:22,933 --> 00:34:24,966
那我们就不忠实于自己

2146
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:27,166
我们没有朝向个性化前进

2147
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,633
我们没有维护社会

2148
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:38,000
我们没有适当地生活 这个想法深深植根于人们作为他们普通经验的一部分 这在我看来也是准确的

2149
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:48,600
我在我的临床实践中处理过很多人 他们通常会说我希望我不那么不快乐

2150
00:34:49,566 --> 00:34:52,200
但他们通常不会说我希望我更快乐

2151
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,300
这两种情感不是一样的 然后当你与遇到困难的人交谈时

2152
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,366
他们想要理清事情 弄清楚如何正确做事 类似这样 这是他们的主要目标

2153
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,133
这是他们的主要目标

2154
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:25,866
所以无论如何 亚伯拉罕派他的长子仆人去他被赐予的地方找妻子

2155
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:33,566
有趣的是 应许之地的边界与当前以色列的边界非常相似

2156
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:38,766
这些都是基于圣经的估计 显然这不是巧合

2157
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:46,000
看到这些古老故事与当今世界的一致性很有趣

2158
00:35:47,133 --> 00:35:49,500
所以 我觉得这非常有趣

2159
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,500
这再次显示 过去...

2160
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:54,133
你以为过去就是过去 但并非如此

2161
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,466
它仍然在这里

2162
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,366
它嵌入在现在

2163
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,433
就像未来在某种程度上被折叠在现在里 等待展开

2164
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,166
过去也被折叠在现在里

2165
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:29,233
所以无论如何 仆人去了他被指派的地方 他试图弄清楚他怎么可能为以撒找到一个好妻子

2166
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,933
我的意思是 他不认识当地人 所以他进行了一种以祷告形式呈现的小对话

2167
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,166
他想 我将去取水的地方 那里人们取水 给动物饮水

2168
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:49,366
因为那是每个人都会聚集的地方 所以那是找人的好地方

2169
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:57,733
那不是一个有趣轻松和冲动的地方 它是一个维系生命的地方 然后他想 那么

2170
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:02,366
一个好女孩在取水处会做什么呢

2171
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:11,200
他想 也许她会主动给陌生人一些水 并且也提供给骆驼饮水

2172
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:16,933
因为这样做既勇敢 因为要接近陌生人 然后又慷慨

2173
00:37:17,466 --> 00:37:24,266
还表明了愿意付出努力的意愿 当 我想他带了十只骆驼

2174
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:30,766
反正是不少的骆驼 不止一只 一只骆驼可以喝20加仑的水

2175
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,266
丽贝卡正从井里汲水 丽贝卡在汲水

2176
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,266
这很不容易 因为水很重 你必须提起来

2177
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:44,033
而且是十只骆驼 所以那就像200加仑的水

2178
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:49,333
所以 她必须付出相当大的努力才能让这个陌生人高兴 所以

2179
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,933
事情就是这样发生的 然后

2180
00:37:55,366 --> 00:38:00,000
仆人带来了礼物等等 总之长话短说

2181
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:09,300
丽贝卡同意和仆人一起回去 嫁给以撒 所以

2182
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:19,166
然后她怀孕了 生了双胞胎 这很有趣 双胞胎在她肚子里就开始打架

2183
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:24,500
她能感觉到他们不和 这是一种呼应 对 这是该隐和亚伯的呼应

2184
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:30,733
有一种神话主题 荣格学派称之为敌对的兄弟

2185
00:38:30,866 --> 00:38:38,766
你总能看到他们 蝙蝠侠和小丑是敌对的兄弟 雷神索尔和洛基是敌对的兄弟 这是一个极其常见的主题

2186
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,666
最终的敌对兄弟是基督和撒旦 那就是他们

2187
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:50,500
这是敌对兄弟的原型表现 最终的善与最终的恶

2188
00:38:51,633 --> 00:38:53,400
这是该隐和亚伯故事的呼应

2189
00:38:54,500 --> 00:39:05,933
虽然从文学角度来看 这更复杂一些 因为哪个兄弟是该隐 哪个是亚伯并不明显 他们各自都有一部分

2190
00:39:06,566 --> 00:39:12,033
所以以扫 其中一个兄弟 雅各是另一个

2191
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:21,166
都有他们的可敬的品质和缺点 无论如何 以扫先出生 但雅各抓住了他的脚跟

2192
00:39:22,066 --> 00:39:26,633
所以在子宫里就有一场战斗 看看谁会先出来

2193
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:35,566
这很重要 因为长子在许多社区 尤其是农业社区 有特殊的地位

2194
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:39,033
这些人更多是牧民

2195
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,333
但如果你将财产平均分配给所有孩子 那么像三代以后

2196
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:48,266
每个人只有一只山羊 每个人都会饿死 或者土地也是一样的情况

2197
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:55,466
所以传统社区解决这个问题的一种方式就是几乎所有东西都给长子

2198
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,166
其他人都知道 你去尽你所能 这有点随意和不公平

2199
00:40:00,366 --> 00:40:07,100
但 至少这是可预测的随意和不公平 而不是注定了四代而亡

2200
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,766
所以成为长子实际上很重要 而且上帝通常偏爱长子 而

2201
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,066
然后你可能会想 首先出生有什么特别之处

2202
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:24,366
除了文化习俗中更丰厚的遗产之外

2203
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,833
首先出生某种意义上是家庭领袖的典范 因为如果长子有很多兄弟姐妹的话

2204
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,433
应该至少在某种程度上照顾兄弟姐妹 但也应该为他们做榜样

2205
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:49,400
所以这是一种天然的领导地位 但这些故事中有一个心理化的首先出生的想法 因为上帝经常越过长子 偏爱后出生的孩子

2206
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:54,133
他似乎基于道德品质做出选择 本质上是这样

2207
00:40:54,566 --> 00:41:00,133
因此有这样一个观念 领导力是一种自然的倾向

2208
00:41:00,233 --> 00:41:07,900
这就是一个生物学事实 与做长子有关 但有一种性格发展的要素超越了这个

2209
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:14,033
因此 精神上成为长子 比起生物学上成为长子来说更重要

2210
00:41:14,466 --> 00:41:19,800
上帝在这些故事中不断地认识到这一点 并颠覆自然秩序

2211
00:41:19,966 --> 00:41:25,766
偏爱那些在性格发展上做了更多工作的晚生子女

2212
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,300
这也是很有趣的

2213
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:30,466
我和许多商业人士谈过领导力

2214
00:41:30,966 --> 00:41:34,133
关于领导力有文献 但那不是好文献

2215
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:35,233
它相当肤浅

2216
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:40,100
因为定义领导力并不容易 部分原因是有不同的

2217
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,833
人们有不同的性格 不同性格的人都可以成为领导者

2218
00:41:45,866 --> 00:41:47,600
他们只是以不同的方式做到这一点

2219
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,733
但关于成为领导者还是有共同之处的

2220
00:41:49,866 --> 00:41:53,966
我会说 首先 如果你是真正的领导者 你实际上知道你要去哪里

2221
00:41:54,566 --> 00:41:57,366
对吧 因为你要带领人们围着圈子转吗

2222
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,166
就像 也许他们会跟随你 但你不是领导者

2223
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:01,666
你只是个骗子 所以你必须知道你要去哪里

2224
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:06,100
然后你必须能够传达这一点 然后人们必须信任你

2225
00:42:06,366 --> 00:42:11,633
所以你实际上必须诚实 因为人们不是那么愚蠢 至少不会长时间那么愚蠢 然后

2226
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:16,833
你要去的地方必须有一些价值 否则为什么有人会愿意跟随你呢

2227
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:21,933
那么 你可能会说 那么 是什么属性使你成为一个领导者呢

2228
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:33,000
我会说 那根本是性格上的 这不是天真的乐观或随便的道德说教 与那些无关

2229
00:42:33,033 --> 00:42:40,433
例如 我们知道责任心这个性格特质

2230
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,766
是大多数职业中长期成功的一个好预测器 不是所有 但大多数 其中一个相关的事项是

2231
00:42:44,866 --> 00:42:52,366
负责任的人会守信用 他们值得信赖 这当然是领导者的一个要素 特别是在任何合理的时间段内

2232
00:42:52,766 --> 00:42:54,233
你必须能够信任这个人

2233
00:42:54,566 --> 00:43:03,066
他们甚至可以是严厉的 对 这没关系 因为你可以看到严厉的领导者和和善的领导者 但只要他们做到他们说他们会做的 那你就可以跟随

2234
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:08,266
未来的回报是安全的 类似这样

2235
00:43:09,266 --> 00:43:15,166
所以性格发展对于领导力比长子继承权更重要的观念

2236
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:19,633
我认为这是正确的词 无论如何是长子

2237
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:26,833
这是一个非常关键的心理认识 性格发展使你受到上帝的青睐

2238
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:38,700
我确实认为我们在很多方面忘记了这一点 因为我们的教育体系中很少强调性格发展 这对我来说非常令人惊讶

2239
00:43:38,766 --> 00:43:42,066
我认为这也许部分是因为在我们这个分裂的社会里

2240
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:50,400
我们无法就什么构成一个合理的性格发展目标达成一致 所以我们只能摊开双手 不对孩子进行任何程度的教育

2241
00:43:50,466 --> 00:43:59,433
尤其是在学校里 我们不教孩子们什么是值得钦佩的人 甚至不让他们知道 也许你实际上应该尝试成为其中之一

2242
00:43:59,566 --> 00:44:04,100
那实际上是你能学到的最重要的事情 对吧

2243
00:44:10,866 --> 00:44:21,266
所以我也认为 我认为这在圣经故事中也被非常彻底地展现出来 那就是如果有足够多的值得钦佩的人 事情就会顺利进行

2244
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,500
如果没有 那么情况就会很糟糕

2245
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,033
你会被消灭

2246
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:38,666
你记得 当亚伯拉罕在与上帝谈判 关于所多玛和蛾摩拉时 他请求上帝 如果城市里有40个值得钦佩的人 上帝就救城市 对吗

2247
00:44:39,233 --> 00:44:40,000
值得尊敬的

2248
00:44:40,233 --> 00:44:41,066
但我们说值得钦佩 对吗

2249
00:44:41,266 --> 00:44:45,966
我不想说好 因为好在某种意义上被随意使用腐化了

2250
00:44:46,933 --> 00:44:49,033
我的意思是值得钦佩 高尚的人 对吗

2251
00:44:50,033 --> 00:44:55,533
亚伯拉罕最终将上帝讨价还价到如果城市里有10个这样的人 城市就不会被毁灭

2252
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,400
而城市里这样的人并不多

2253
00:44:57,633 --> 00:44:59,300
所以这里有一个有趣的观点

2254
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:04,100
那就是一个群体中不一定需要很多人去行动

2255
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:11,500
但零是错误的数字 如果是零 那么我们确实有麻烦了 而且

2256
00:45:12,466 --> 00:45:16,433
我认为这与经济学中的帕累托原则也有关

2257
00:45:16,566 --> 00:45:21,400
即在任何给定领域 大部分生产性工作都是由少数人完成的 但是

2258
00:45:22,266 --> 00:45:30,433
所以 少数行为得当的人可能对保持一切正常运转有足够的影响 这可能实际上是真的

2259
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,833
但它不能低于某个关键水平

2260
00:45:33,466 --> 00:45:37,633
我确实认为我们有让它降到某个关键水平以下的危险 因为

2261
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:45,566
我们的社会在某种程度上似乎正在与个体及其个性的概念作战

2262
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:54,800
我认为这绝对是灾难性的 这也是我进行这些圣经讲座的部分原因

2263
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,033
因为我认为

2264
00:45:57,233 --> 00:45:58,400
我长期以来就知道

2265
00:45:59,433 --> 00:46:04,266
文化的道德前提是通过它的故事体现出来的

2266
00:46:05,066 --> 00:46:07,333
它们不是在其明确的哲学中体现出来的

2267
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:12,566
可能有一层明确的哲学 当然 在西方有一层明确的法律

2268
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:20,133
但在那下面有故事 除了行为之外 没有什么在故事下面了 那是如此隐含

2269
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:28,766
它甚至实际上不算 不是一个认知操作 所以这些就是我们文化底下的故事 所以

2270
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:32,300
这些故事最好有些价值

2271
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:34,366
这是我们的希望 但更重要的是

2272
00:46:35,066 --> 00:46:39,766
也许我们在不知道它们的意义的情况下不应该轻易丢弃它们 因为如果我们丢弃了它们

2273
00:46:40,033 --> 00:46:45,766
那我们也同样丢弃了我们所依赖的一切 据我所知 我们将为此付出代价

2274
00:46:46,266 --> 00:46:50,833
我们将个人付出代价 因为我们会变得软弱  因为如果你对自己的信念不坚定

2275
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:58,033
那么任何一个信念坚定的人都可以立即操纵你 然后你也会成为自己怀疑的傀儡

2276
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:00,500
对吧 因为除非你有信念

2277
00:47:01,433 --> 00:47:05,166
否则你会产生疯狂的怀疑 因为每个人都会这样 然后怀疑获胜

2278
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:10,700
你会因为怀疑而瘫痪 因为你会50%向前移动 50%僵硬不动

2279
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,933
这就足以让你原地不动 所以

2280
00:47:19,866 --> 00:47:26,300
好吧 所以有一个对领导力观念的心理学化 这非常重要 然后它与性格发展的观念相关

2281
00:47:26,366 --> 00:47:32,566
与挣扎而不是幸福的观念相关 也与这种亚伯拉罕的观念相关

2282
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:38,300
我真的很喜欢 这对我来说 因为进行这些讲座是非常有用的 因为

2283
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,233
记得在亚伯拉罕故事的开头 亚伯拉罕就像是个宅男 对吧

2284
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,033
他就像是那个40岁还住在他母亲地下室的人

2285
00:47:47,466 --> 00:47:49,366
上帝说 从那里出来

2286
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,933
出去到你属于的世界去做些事情

2287
00:47:52,766 --> 00:47:58,033
做一些困难的事情 因为你现在所做的是不可接受的 他第一件事就是去了一个地方

2288
00:47:58,066 --> 00:47:59,966
那里有可怕的饥荒 然后他又去了一个地方

2289
00:48:00,033 --> 00:48:03,066
那里有暴政 所以 这很有趣

2290
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:09,400
他遵循了上帝的召唤 并不是立即就是甜美和光明的天堂 根本不是那样

2291
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:12,066
这是立即的战斗

2292
00:48:12,066 --> 00:48:22,400
最困难的那种战斗 但是亚伯拉罕确实遵循了那种冲动 这也很有趣

2293
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:27,900
我的意思是 我不知道 这也让我成为了心理分析思想的真正倡导者

2294
00:48:29,166 --> 00:48:33,366
这种事情开始让我对人类心灵的实际情况感到恐惧

2295
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:40,266
我开始理解 我们不仅仅是相对自治的子人格的混合体

2296
00:48:40,433 --> 00:48:43,200
每一个都有获得控制的可能性

2297
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,400
而且我们还是受害者 可以这么说

2298
00:48:48,733 --> 00:48:54,300
或者是冲动的受益者 这些冲动超出了我们的意识形态或

2299
00:48:55,333 --> 00:49:00,400
或者理解或抗拒的能力 这里有个有趣的故事

2300
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:04,333
所以这周我在网上和我的一个Patreon支持者谈话

2301
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,366
他说他是一个坚定的无神论者 这很好

2302
00:49:08,566 --> 00:49:12,733
许多无神论者都是非常诚实的人 他们之所以是无神论者 是因为

2303
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:20,166
他们不知道如何与传统主张调和 他们不愿意只是将它们混在一起

2304
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,700
可能还有怀疑主义 也有这些

2305
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:27,866
但他说他被这些圣经讲座迷住了

2306
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:35,333
这很奇怪 他说如果一年前有人告诉他他会对一系列圣经讲座着迷

2307
00:49:35,366 --> 00:49:37,100
他会告诉他们他们疯了

2308
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:47,033
所以我们有一些讨论 因为这很有趣 他提到了这一点 他说这就像不是你选择你的兴趣

2309
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,733
而是它们选择你 这也值得好好思考 伙计

2310
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:56,400
因为 对你不感兴趣的东西感兴趣真的很难 即使这样做有好处

2311
00:49:56,633 --> 00:49:59,233
你为考试而学习 发现材料无聊

2312
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:06,800
任何东西都会比学习更有趣 即使那是你需要做的 你也做不到

2313
00:50:07,066 --> 00:50:12,500
比如说 自发地抓住自己的颈背 摇晃自己并说坐下来集中注意力

2314
00:50:13,233 --> 00:50:20,300
你的思维将四处游移 但如果你对某事感兴趣 即使是你不应该感兴趣的东西 因为这种情况一直都在发生

2315
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,166
你会专注力惊人

2316
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:24,466
你可以永远保持注意

2317
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,933
你可以工作直到精疲力尽

2318
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,433
你甚至不会察觉 而且你会记住一切

2319
00:50:28,433 --> 00:50:33,266
就好像 如果你无法控制你的兴趣 那什么能呢

2320
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,466
哥们 我告诉你 你可以思考这个很长时间

2321
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,266
所以荣格谈到了灵魂墨丘利

2322
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,866
水星是神的翼使者 这就是他从心理学角度如何概念化它的

2323
00:50:45,966 --> 00:50:48,133
他认为这是古人

2324
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:55,233
那些将水星视为神的翼使者的人 试图从心理学角度说明的 你的兴趣四处飘移

2325
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:59,833
就好像有什么东西捕捉了它 然后把你的兴趣从一个地方移动到另一个地方

2326
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,133
比如当你走进一家书店 你会对某本特定的书产生兴趣

2327
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:08,333
就好像那本书吸引了你 因为你不知道为什么你会对那本书感兴趣 你可能会（知道）

2328
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,866
但往往你不知道为什么你对那本书感兴趣

2329
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:18,066
你的兴趣在四处飘移 所以那就是墨丘利 使你的兴趣四处闪烁的是墨丘利 神的翼使者

2330
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:25,266
墨丘利是神的使者 因为它是在幕后心理上操纵你注意力的东西

2331
00:51:25,966 --> 00:51:29,033
对于荣格来说 这些在某种意义上等同于失落的神

2332
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:39,166
因此 对于荣格来说 你的兴趣是被幕后的看不见的力量所操纵 这些力量与你随时间发展的性格特征有关

2333
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:41,000
那是自我显现的表现

2334
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,733
所以自我是这个……可能的你 比方说

2335
00:51:46,366 --> 00:51:50,433
它在现在的操作方式是 通过抓住你的兴趣并将其引向某处

2336
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,366
这是自我实现本能的一部分

2337
00:51:54,033 --> 00:51:55,733
这是一个令人难以置信的想法 伙计

2338
00:51:55,733 --> 00:51:56,133
真的 这是……

2339
00:51:56,966 --> 00:51:58,100
我认为这是正确的

2340
00:51:58,133 --> 00:51:59,600
我看不出它怎么可能不正确

2341
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:04,233
这并不意味着我完全理解它 但它肯定在现象学上是正确的 而且……

2342
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:10,100
我的意思是 你所拥有的潜能必须以某种方式在此时此刻显现出来

2343
00:52:10,666 --> 00:52:14,266
它必须 还有什么比通过引导你的注意力更好的方式呢

2344
00:52:14,466 --> 00:52:18,566
这就像是对你可能有用的东西 或许你会被这个人吸引

2345
00:52:18,966 --> 00:52:21,400
也许你会钦佩这个人 这在孩子们身上很常见

2346
00:52:21,566 --> 00:52:27,633
他们会钦佩某人然后模仿他们 你可以看到这显然是他们发展过程的一部分 对吧

2347
00:52:27,766 --> 00:52:35,000
这是一种英雄崇拜的形式 但孩子们非常善于模仿 他们一下子就会英雄崇拜

2348
00:52:35,133 --> 00:52:42,633
因此他们被下一个发展阶段所吸引 如果他们看到某人体现了那个 特别是在相近发展区内的

2349
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:49,300
这是他们稍微有点努力就能够实现的东西 他们找到了一个体现下一个发展阶段的人

2350
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,733
然后他们开始模仿他们 像他们那样行动

2351
00:52:52,733 --> 00:52:54,333
我们成年人也没什么不同

2352
00:52:54,366 --> 00:52:54,966
我们没有什么不同

2353
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,866
我们只是 我们做的可能在一个更抽象和复杂的层面上

2354
00:53:01,933 --> 00:53:05,833
所以雅各和以扫是敌对的兄弟

2355
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:09,400
他们像该隐和亚伯一样 只是该隐和亚伯的混合体 他们非常不同

2356
00:53:10,866 --> 00:53:12,533
以扫浑身是红色 满是毛发

2357
00:53:12,533 --> 00:53:15,666
他是一个猎人 是田野之人 所以他就像是一个标准的硬汉 对吧

2358
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,633
他是外向的

2359
00:53:16,666 --> 00:53:17,266
他是开朗的

2360
00:53:17,266 --> 00:53:18,400
他非常坚韧

2361
00:53:18,433 --> 00:53:20,500
他像是极度阳刚之气

2362
00:53:20,766 --> 00:53:27,733
他狩猎 他是他父亲的真正宠儿 所以 而雅各不是 他是居住在帐篷里的

2363
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,666
是的 确切地说

2364
00:53:31,233 --> 00:53:36,766
完全正确 而且它说以撒爱以扫 但利百加爱雅各 现在

2365
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,900
这是一个问题 对吧 这是一个大问题

2366
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:42,966
这里有一种弗洛伊德元素 就像这个家庭现在因为

2367
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:50,000
一个孩子是母亲的宠儿 那是雅各 一个孩子是父亲的宠儿

2368
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:54,300
所以雅各有点像是妈妈的孩子 我想用一个相当古老的短语来说 而且

2369
00:53:54,700 --> 00:54:07,133
而且 从他父亲的角度来看 他肯定不如以扫那样令人钦佩 以扫是个硬汉 带着弓箭出去 在平原上漫游 带回家动物 他很强悍

2370
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:07,900
他是个硬汉

2371
00:54:08,833 --> 00:54:24,000
但家里有这样的不和 因为父母中的一位偏爱这个孩子 另一位偏爱另一个 从故事中很明显 父母之间没有就此进行沟通 因为他们确实站队了 因此家庭中出现了裂痕

2372
00:54:24,533 --> 00:54:30,533
我认为这非常现实 因为你如果有一个家庭 当然你们大多数人都有

2373
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:38,900
但如果你也思考家庭的话 就会知道家庭内部很频繁地存在深刻的分歧 这些是永远不会有人谈及的

2374
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:46,933
甚至经常因为想到这些太痛苦了而不去思考的 连弗洛伊德自己都说过 显然他是母亲的宠儿

2375
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:52,566
而他的家庭牺牲了很多 包括其他孩子的一些潜在抱负

2376
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:57,166
为的是把西格蒙德·弗洛伊德捧上高台 推进他的教育

2377
00:54:57,233 --> 00:54:58,000
而这成功了

2378
00:54:58,033 --> 00:55:02,200
我的意思是  他成为了一位伟大的人物 但这对他的兄弟姐妹来说是有代价的

2379
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,400
弗洛伊德本人说 作为母亲的宠儿

2380
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:11,466
会给一个人带来终生的额外自信

2381
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:14,766
关于这一点有些东西值得说

2382
00:55:14,866 --> 00:55:21,000
即使是像埃里克·埃里克森这样的人 他非常关注儿童发展 首次与母亲的联系是建立信任的地方

2383
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:30,600
也许甚至是建立对存在善意的信任的地方 所以无论如何 雅各是拉结最喜爱的

2384
00:55:34,066 --> 00:55:35,300
以扫是以撒最喜爱的

2385
00:55:40,466 --> 00:55:42,933
现在以扫 作为一个外向的人

2386
00:55:42,966 --> 00:55:47,500
可以说也有点冲动 也许他不是一个行动的人

2387
00:55:47,533 --> 00:55:48,900
他不是一个前瞻性思考者

2388
00:55:49,866 --> 00:55:53,800
但他也在做艰苦的工作 所以 他外出打猎 他累坏了

2389
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,433
他回到家 饿得要昏过去

2390
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:00,266
雅各在家里做饭

2391
00:56:00,266 --> 00:56:02,600
他正在煮红扁豆

2392
00:56:03,366 --> 00:56:08,600
以扫从打猎回来 饿得半死 他坐在那里

2393
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:11,800
这些红扁豆的香味飘到他那里

2394
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:14,700
他筋疲力尽

2395
00:56:16,366 --> 00:56:24,133
他告诉雅各他想要一些这个汤 雅各本质上是个代表着痛苦的存在

2396
00:56:24,366 --> 00:56:24,900
基本上

2397
00:56:25,533 --> 00:56:26,900
他直接说不

2398
00:56:27,366 --> 00:56:32,933
这里有一种戏弄的事情发生 不给他任何东西

2399
00:56:33,733 --> 00:56:39,466
你必须想象这一点 因为故事中没有明确说明 但存在一些争议

2400
00:56:40,466 --> 00:56:46,766
关于是否以扫能吃午餐 雅各最终说 我会给你一些 但你必须给我你的长子权利

2401
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:53,066
你会想 以扫 他一定会说类似于的 去他的

2402
00:56:53,466 --> 00:56:53,966
拿去吧

2403
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,900
你这个混蛋 拿去吧

2404
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,233
就给我来点该死的汤吧

2405
00:56:58,533 --> 00:57:00,933
就是这么回事 所以事情就这样发生了

2406
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:04,900
但 对这些古老的人来说 一旦你这样说了 那你就完了

2407
00:57:05,133 --> 00:57:17,466
就这样 因此以扫卖掉了他的长子权利 这事变得极为重要 本森 一位撰写圣经评论的人说 哦

2408
00:57:18,866 --> 00:57:24,600
这事有点曲折 因此以扫吃了红扁豆 从那时起他的名字就变成了红色

2409
00:57:25,933 --> 00:57:27,700
你得发挥一点想象

2410
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,300
我的意思是 人们取笑他 对 那就是为什么他们叫他红色

2411
00:57:31,466 --> 00:57:37,500
我的意思是 他本来就是红色的 因为我们已经确定了 但在这之前没人叫他红色 所以在他余下的生命中

2412
00:57:38,366 --> 00:57:43,933
每次他在朋友和家人中出现时 他们都叫他红色 并且暗笑

2413
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:50,633
因为他就是那个半饿死的傻瓜 为了一碗扁豆汤卖掉了他的长子权利 所以这其实并不好笑

2414
00:57:51,066 --> 00:57:56,633
实际上 因此以扫对此并不开心 这实际上意味着什么呢

2415
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,700
这意味着不要为了当下的欲望而出卖未来 不要对你所拥有的漫不经心

2416
00:58:02,233 --> 00:58:09,133
然后这里还有一个原型元素 本森说 对于以扫卖掉的这个长子权利是什么 意见有很多种

2417
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,633
但最可能的是 它不仅仅是关于献祭的权利

2418
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:18,233
也就是决定什么时候应该献祭什么 成为家族的祭司

2419
00:58:18,866 --> 00:58:25,233
它包括了对亚伯拉罕的后裔所许下的特别祝福 那就是成为弥赛亚的祖先

2420
00:58:25,533 --> 00:58:29,300
以及 特别的是 上帝对基督王国的应许的继承人

2421
00:58:29,866 --> 00:58:35,333
至少是典型的精神特权 那些记载在天上的长子特权

2422
00:58:37,166 --> 00:58:43,066
嗯 这比开始时看起来要严峻得多

2423
00:58:43,233 --> 00:58:49,200
因此 这里有一个非常有趣、深刻的道德故事

2424
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:54,200
这有点像 以扫做了一种与牺牲相反的事

2425
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,300
就是反过来 对吧

2426
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,366
他为了当下牺牲了未来

2427
00:58:58,466 --> 00:59:02,300
所以这个故事基本上是说 按照它在各种故事中的布局

2428
00:59:02,566 --> 00:59:08,133
如果你是那种为了当下牺牲未来的人

2429
00:59:08,466 --> 00:59:15,400
那么你带来最尊贵存在的可能性就会被消灭

2430
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,333
这就是它的意思

2431
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:18,000
再一次

2432
00:59:18,033 --> 00:59:21,466
这是圣经故事的心理意义

2433
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:26,300
所以 如果你想实现你的潜能 那么做这样的事是不好的

2434
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:28,400
我们说你不做逆向牺牲

2435
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:40,133
这是一个非常糟糕的主意 因此以扫因为太依附于当下而没有对未来的愿景而真正害了自己 他太专注于当下了

2436
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,233
他为此付出了沉重的代价

2437
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:47,866
我的意思是 首先他失去了他的长子权利和双份遗产

2438
00:59:48,033 --> 00:59:50,833
所以这有一个实际的后果 然后有一个精神的后果

2439
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:55,733
然后他 他被他的兄弟雅各愚弄了 雅各的意思是

2440
00:59:56,966 --> 00:59:58,000
替代者 顺便说一下

2441
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:05,333
这就是这个名字的意思 雅各总是试图篡夺以扫的位置 正如我们所见 所以雅各在他身上占了上风

2442
01:00:05,433 --> 01:00:09,766
当一个弟弟占了哥哥的便宜时 这并不会让一个哥哥感到开心

2443
01:00:09,866 --> 01:00:13,966
这是肯定的 然后他失去了成为弥赛亚祖先的机会

2444
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:18,066
这就像他可能没有准确意识到这一点 但看起来似乎是这样

2445
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,266
这种情况有点严酷 所以

2446
01:00:23,466 --> 01:00:32,733
然后马太福音16:26中有一句话 人若赚得全世界 赔上自己的灵魂 算什么益处呢

2447
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:34,600
这是同一个想法的呼应

2448
01:00:34,633 --> 01:00:40,833
当你思考灵魂的这个概念是什么意思 它不是指智力

2449
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:44,066
而是像是意识联合了品格

2450
01:00:44,366 --> 01:00:48,800
我认为 我认为它之所以如此珍贵 是因为你必须问自己

2451
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,066
好吧 当归结到底 你真正拥有什么

2452
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:53,600
生活是一场苦难 我们可以说

2453
01:00:54,233 --> 01:01:01,266
你可以堆积世俗的财富 而旧约中的上帝似乎并不真的反对这一点 对 他所青睐的人

2454
01:01:01,766 --> 01:01:07,466
在世界上似乎过得相当不错 但他们也必须做出选择

2455
01:01:08,033 --> 01:01:17,066
在是否要根本维持他们的品格或者在世上繁荣之间做出选择 而当事情变得紧要时 这个想法一直是

2456
01:01:18,166 --> 01:01:24,000
你在世上真正拥有的 允许你最好地防御固有于存在的苦难的 就是你的品格

2457
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:24,933
那就是你所拥有的

2458
01:01:25,666 --> 01:01:26,566
就这些

2459
01:01:26,566 --> 01:01:29,733
我认为没有什么比这在心理上更真实了

2460
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,433
因为其他一切 首先你与他人的关系取决于你的品格

2461
01:01:36,066 --> 01:01:38,400
当然 这是诺亚方舟故事的一部分

2462
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,000
因为他的世代是完美的 所以我们有一个非常紧密的家庭安排

2463
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:48,733
每个人都信任彼此 这在你生命中遇到困难时是非常重要的 对吧

2464
01:01:49,266 --> 01:01:58,366
并且它是品格决定的 如果你慷慨且诚实等等 人们知道他们可以依靠你 假设他们不怀有怨恨

2465
01:01:58,366 --> 01:01:59,866
那是另一个完全不同的故事

2466
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,666
然后 当需要时 他们会来帮助你

2467
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,166
他们会与你团结一致

2468
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:09,766
当人们因为某种原因真的追捕你 并且指控你各种事情

2469
01:02:10,333 --> 01:02:15,000
而你有罪 因为你有一个充满品格错误的过去

2470
01:02:15,466 --> 01:02:20,733
那么人们很容易击倒你 因为他们会不断挑战 直到他们触及你有罪的地方

2471
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,966
然后你就完了 因为你会用你自己的判断来自我毁灭

2472
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:28,600
所以 以扫犯了一个非常大的错误

2473
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:41,333
这里也有一个牺牲的观念 就是 时不时你会面临这样的情况 这是你真正想要的东西 或者你的品格

2474
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:43,200
也许你必须对某事撒谎

2475
01:02:44,733 --> 01:02:46,266
你会想 这有什么区别呢

2476
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:47,466
我就撒谎好了

2477
01:02:48,666 --> 01:02:49,766
雅各就是这么做的

2478
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,766
但问题是 有很多问题

2479
01:02:51,800 --> 01:03:00,433
一是 现在你很清楚 如果有闪亮的东西在你面前晃来晃去 你实际上是那种会在现实本质上欺骗自己的人

2480
01:03:00,933 --> 01:03:03,466
这不好 因为它破坏了你对自己的信念

2481
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:08,533
当你真正遇到麻烦时 那被称为灵魂的黑夜 当你真正遇到麻烦时

2482
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,433
你拥有的是你是否能够信任自己

2483
01:03:12,566 --> 01:03:15,700
就是这个 当事情真的很艰难时

2484
01:03:16,133 --> 01:03:22,333
所以 如果你以这种方式背叛了自己 那么你在最糟糕的情况下削弱了自己

2485
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,266
这真的不是一件好事

2486
01:03:25,466 --> 01:03:25,600
所以

2487
01:03:26,733 --> 01:03:28,233
这是非常实用的建议

2488
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,633
这不是随便的道德说教

2489
01:03:31,633 --> 01:03:33,833
这些故事中很少有随便的道德训诫

2490
01:03:36,066 --> 01:03:40,133
在故事的下一个部分 有一些与亚伯拉罕相似的情节 这是故事叙述中内置的

2491
01:03:40,133 --> 01:03:48,566
我认为这是因为以撒是亚伯拉罕的后代 所以我们必须保持叙述向之前呼应

2492
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:54,133
否则它会失去其连贯性

2493
01:03:54,300 --> 01:04:00,400
以撒所在的土地上有一场饥荒 上帝告诉他无论如何都要坚持下去

2494
01:04:00,766 --> 01:04:09,000
重复他对亚伯拉罕的承诺 虽然以撒也去见了亚比米勒 告诉国王和人们利百加是他的妹妹

2495
01:04:09,066 --> 01:04:12,900
这正是亚伯拉罕去埃及时所做的 所以这里有相同的呼应

2496
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:20,866
就好像故事的底层被第二次讲述 这应该提醒你之前的故事

2497
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:27,400
但在疏忽之下 国王看到利百加和以撒在一起亲密

2498
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,600
幸运的是 他没有将他们处死

2499
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:41,633
他只是告诉王国里的每个人要离他们远点 然后以撒在那片土地上就像亚伯拉罕在埃及时一样繁荣起来 直到非利士人请他离开

2500
01:04:41,633 --> 01:04:43,300
他变得太富有和强大了

2501
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:48,000
事情对他来说太顺利了 所以他被请离

2502
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,033
与此同时 以扫结婚了 这是一个有趣的小故事

2503
01:04:53,033 --> 01:05:03,366
他说他娶了两个给以撒和利百加带来烦恼的女人 所以无论以扫娶了谁 她们都不受他的姻亲欢迎 一点也不

2504
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,566
这实际上稍后变得相关 因为

2505
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:10,266
他们让利百加几乎发狂 我对此感到好笑 因为这很常见

2506
01:05:10,266 --> 01:05:16,666
要将新人融入你的家庭 并希望这会顺利进行

2507
01:05:16,866 --> 01:05:19,900
实际上是生活中的一大灾难 对吧 你有个孩子

2508
01:05:20,433 --> 01:05:22,600
也许你和他们相处得来 也许不行

2509
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:27,433
但假设你们相处得来 但然后他们娶了一个你不喜欢的人 或者

2510
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,133
也许你认为不适合他们

2511
01:05:30,166 --> 01:05:31,066
我的意思是 这真的很艰难

2512
01:05:31,366 --> 01:05:36,500
那你该怎么办呢  因为你基本上两头受困

2513
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:42,133
如果你让你爱的人在身边 那么你不得不忍受他们联合的那个可怕生物

2514
01:05:42,666 --> 01:05:46,400
而如果你完全摆脱他们 那么 你就再也没有你的孩子了

2515
01:05:46,733 --> 01:05:51,766
所以这是一个非常非常困难的位置 因此这是现实主义的另一个例子

2516
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:56,266
我认为现在的故事中以撒在临终之床上请求以扫去打猎

2517
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:02,733
因为他喜欢鹿肉 他很高兴他的儿子是个猎人 利百加偷听到了这个

2518
01:06:03,933 --> 01:06:10,066
于是她与雅各密谋屠杀两只小山羊

2519
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:16,200
给他的父亲做些炖肉 因为他想让以扫用鹿肉做炖肉

2520
01:06:16,866 --> 01:06:23,300
并且利百加正在 我会说 让我们说轻微的欺骗或者可怕的谎言将会更准确

2521
01:06:24,866 --> 01:06:35,233
她与雅各密谋 所以雅各杀了两只小山羊羔并煮了炖肉 然后他穿上了山羊皮 因为以扫是个多毛的人

2522
01:06:36,233 --> 01:06:45,966
利百加用以扫的衣服打扮以撒 因为这时以撒的视力已经不好了 所以雅各带着炖肉进去见他的父亲

2523
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,033
他试图伪装他的声音 但并不太成功

2524
01:06:50,966 --> 01:06:56,100
所以以撒要求他靠近 雅各伸出穿着山羊皮的手臂

2525
01:06:56,266 --> 01:07:06,066
以撒也闻了闻他 闻起来像以扫 这可能不是最好的事情 感觉像他

2526
01:07:07,033 --> 01:07:08,733
因为以撒认为他即将死亡

2527
01:07:10,466 --> 01:07:15,533
所以他决定给予这个伪装的以扫以祝福

2528
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:23,133
但是是雅各...所以这也是个大问题 因为祝福实际上正如我之前所说 对这些古人来说

2529
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:27,000
似乎一旦你说了些什么你就不能收回

2530
01:07:27,433 --> 01:07:31,333
你不能说 看看你欺骗了我 所以这不算数

2531
01:07:32,366 --> 01:07:34,833
就像我他们可能不像...

2532
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,966
嗯 一种思考方式可能是他们软弱

2533
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,900
但另一种方式是他们可能没有那么关注来龙去脉

2534
01:07:43,066 --> 01:07:47,166
因为如果我和你达成一个协议 然后结果你背叛了我

2535
01:07:47,266 --> 01:07:49,900
我可能会觉得这个协议不再有效

2536
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:55,233
因为协议的假设是你一开始就诚实 而现在你违反了整个精神

2537
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:59,266
但这不是这些人的想法 他们说一旦你承诺了 你就承诺了 就是这样

2538
01:08:00,266 --> 01:08:03,300
所以以撒给雅各祝福 他说

2539
01:08:04,366 --> 01:08:08,066
愿上帝赐给你天上的露水和地上的肥沃 以及丰富的谷物和酒

2540
01:08:08,533 --> 01:08:11,166
愿人们服侍你 国家向你鞠躬

2541
01:08:11,166 --> 01:08:11,933
成为你兄弟的主宰

2542
01:08:12,966 --> 01:08:14,133
这对以扫来说会很艰难

2543
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,400
让你母亲的儿子们向你下拜吧

2544
01:08:16,433 --> 01:08:20,166
诅咒那些诅咒你的人 祝福那些祝福你的人

2545
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,833
所以这有一幅相当卓越的画

2546
01:08:24,833 --> 01:08:25,766
所以这里有利百加

2547
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:26,766
她看起来相当老

2548
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:29,833
以撒看起来相当盲目

2549
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:37,566
雅各布正在听从他母亲的指示 我们可能会说 他可能很大了 无法从他母亲那里接受道德教训

2550
01:08:37,566 --> 01:08:43,000
特别是考虑到她的表现 所以这整体上是一个相当丑陋的场面 尤其是我们也知道

2551
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:52,766
雅各已经欺骗了以扫的长子权 所以现在他像是拿走了长子权 又拿走了祝福 所以正如我所说

2552
01:08:54,133 --> 01:08:56,633
雅各他最终成为以色列的父亲

2553
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,800
就像他是一个应受谴责的角色

2554
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,800
这些是重大的背叛 他所从事的并不是小事

2555
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,133
他真的

2556
01:09:03,933 --> 01:09:04,300
真的

2557
01:09:05,166 --> 01:09:07,633
从他兄弟脚下抽走了地毯 你可能会说

2558
01:09:07,733 --> 01:09:12,733
以扫可能没有他应有的那么警醒 他有点野蛮 公平地说

2559
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:19,633
但在我看来 主要的道德错误在于雅各身上

2560
01:09:19,633 --> 01:09:21,633
他所做的是非常危险的行为

2561
01:09:23,066 --> 01:09:29,533
然后以扫出现了 他为他父亲带来了一头美丽的鹿 那时候已经太晚了

2562
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:34,533
他说他的兄弟被恰当地命名为雅各 意味着篡夺者

2563
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:41,666
因为他被欺骗了两次 以撒回答 他在询问很有趣

2564
01:09:41,666 --> 01:09:41,866
是的

2565
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:44,900
我从根本上问 还有什么东西留给他

2566
01:09:46,066 --> 01:09:50,400
以撒不能给他相同的祝福 因为那已经被赐予了 所以他必须想出别的东西

2567
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:55,933
以撒说 看哪 我已经让他成为你的主宰 他的所有兄弟

2568
01:09:56,066 --> 01:10:02,366
我已经让他们成为他的仆人 包括你 以谷物和酒我已经供养了他

2569
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:08,733
我现在还能为我的儿子做什么 以扫对他父亲说 请你给我哪怕一份祝福吧 我的父亲 也祝福我

2570
01:10:09,633 --> 01:10:15,266
以扫扬起声来哭泣 我们已经知道以扫表面上是个相当强硬的家伙

2571
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:24,700
他自己在外面打猎和露营 他不是个容易对付的人 他的落泪表明了背叛的严重程度

2572
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:31,700
以撒说 看哪 你的住所将是地上的肥沃和天上的露水

2573
01:10:31,866 --> 01:10:36,800
你将靠剑生活 你将服侍你的兄弟 当你掌权时

2574
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:43,700
你将把他的轭从你颈上挣脱 以扫因为他父亲所给的祝福而恨雅各

2575
01:10:44,433 --> 01:10:50,000
以扫心里说 我父亲哀悼的日子近了 到那时我要杀了我的兄弟雅各

2576
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:56,500
所以从根本上说 如果以撒去世 或者当他去世时 我们会为他哀悼

2577
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:06,033
然后雅各最好小心了 因为这是严肃的死亡正向他走来 有一个观点

2578
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:09,500
他在但丁的地狱中

2579
01:11:09,533 --> 01:11:12,433
我想我曾经提到过这一点 所以但丁的地狱

2580
01:11:12,466 --> 01:11:13,600
这是一个非常有趣的故事

2581
01:11:13,766 --> 01:11:15,266
这是一次下降到地狱的旅程 而且

2582
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:22,433
我们对地狱的流行概念实际上部分基于但丁的想象 基于他的作品

2583
01:11:22,933 --> 01:11:29,266
但丁试图探索邪恶的层级结构

2584
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:33,633
你可能认为善有层级结构 有些事物比其他事物更好

2585
01:11:34,266 --> 01:11:41,933
但邪恶也有层级结构 有些邪恶比其他邪恶更大 他把背叛放在了地狱的最底层

2586
01:11:42,633 --> 01:11:48,000
对 所以如果你背叛了人们 你自己就在撒旦旁边 所以 我认为这很好

2587
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,400
这非常聪明

2588
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,066
毕竟但丁是个天才

2589
01:11:52,866 --> 01:11:56,600
我认为原因是 你看 如果有人信任你

2590
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,900
他们就把他们的脆弱性向你敞开了

2591
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:00,800
他们可能只是天真

2592
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:07,300
我们说 假设你只是个孩子 如果你天真 你仍然可以被背叛

2593
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:11,500
但如果你是成年人并且信任 通常是因为你 如果你是真正的成年人

2594
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:17,266
你会自愿地敞开自己 知道你可能会受到伤害 对 因为你不再天真

2595
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:20,666
所以你决定信任并且说我会敞开自己

2596
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:26,266
我知道我把自己暴露给你 如果你选择利用这种力量

2597
01:12:26,866 --> 01:12:31,600
然后这是一件好事 如果你小时候受到伤害 或者作为一个天真的人受到伤害 你可能会说

2598
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,033
那我为什么还要再次信任呢

2599
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,466
这是一个非常好的问题

2600
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:39,000
而答案是 你再次信任的原因--在你成年之后--是因为你勇敢

2601
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,133
你勇敢

2602
01:12:41,166 --> 01:12:42,966
信任是一种勇气的行为

2603
01:12:43,466 --> 01:12:51,833
之所以有用 是因为如果你信任某人 你就打开了互惠、协商和合作的大门

2604
01:12:52,466 --> 01:12:55,300
你吸引出那个人最好的一部分

2605
01:12:55,966 --> 01:12:57,766
所以这是一个勇敢的行为

2606
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:03,366
但如果你背叛了某人 那么你所做的就是你拿走了他们最好的一部分

2607
01:13:03,533 --> 01:13:10,733
那就是会勇敢地信任你的那部分 明明白白地 并且你在那里插了一刀

2608
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:17,233
所以你故意伤害了他们最好的那部分 所以这就是为什么这是如此严重的过错

2609
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,266
通常人们不会从这种事情中恢复过来 如果你足够严重地背叛某人

2610
01:13:23,366 --> 01:13:27,533
你可以伤害他们 你给他们造成创伤后应激障碍

2611
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,566
如果你真的全身心的相信而后被背叛

2612
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:37,633
那不仅仅是一种心理障碍 如果你有创伤后应激障碍 它会产生永久的神经学变化

2613
01:13:38,566 --> 01:13:43,666
使你更神经质 对负面情绪更敏感 真的是你的一生 你可以从中恢复到某种程度

2614
01:13:44,733 --> 01:13:54,833
但压力会倾向于重新激发PTSD 所以你伤害了某人 并不仅仅是心理上的 不

2615
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:05,366
不是说心理上是次要的 但这不仅仅是心理上的 对吧 这是基本的生理伤害 所以不管怎样雅各聪明地离开了那里

2616
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:16,133
这也并不真的证明他的正直 对吧 我的意思是他为了追求权力做了这些可怕的事情 因为他的母亲的要求

2617
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:26,033
而且他想要得到它 而它不是他应得的 然后 他最终做得太过分了 他逃到了另一个家庭成员那里

2618
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:37,633
去了他母亲的兄弟那里 所以这并不是世界上最英勇的故事 这是肯定的 所以现在这里有一个插曲

2619
01:14:37,833 --> 01:14:48,066
这是一个真正有趣的插曲 这是雅各的梯子的故事 所以他去拜访拉班 或者拉班 他母亲的兄弟

2620
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:51,466
在路上 他睡着了

2621
01:14:51,466 --> 01:14:54,000
他来到一个地方 因为日落了 就在那里过夜

2622
01:14:54,733 --> 01:14:58,466
他拿那个地方的石头做枕头

2623
01:14:59,266 --> 01:15:04,833
这似乎表明他计划得很糟糕 在那个地方睡下

2624
01:15:04,866 --> 01:15:13,000
他做梦 看见一个梯子立在地上 顶端达到天堂 看见上帝的天使在其上升降

2625
01:15:13,033 --> 01:15:14,766
看哪 主站在其上说

2626
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,766
我是你父亲亚伯拉罕的上帝耶和华 以撒的上帝

2627
01:15:18,766 --> 01:15:20,566
你所躺卧的地 我要赐给你和你的后裔

2628
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,400
所以雅各梯子的故事真的俘获了西方的想象

2629
01:15:24,066 --> 01:15:29,966
这是因为它是一个原型故事 因为通向天堂的梯子的想法是人类最古老的想法之一

2630
01:15:29,966 --> 01:15:30,900
这是有原因的

2631
01:15:31,266 --> 01:15:37,100
在萨满文化中 例如 你会发现它广泛分布 这是迷幻体验的标志

2632
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:44,066
这是另一种思考方式

2633
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,866
这是一件非常奇特的事情 所以有一个梯子的表现 你看上帝在顶部那里

2634
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:54,600
从云中探出头来

2635
01:15:55,533 --> 01:16:03,266
这是我们得到上帝在天堂 然后天堂在天空中的想法的来源 这是一个容易被嘲笑的故事

2636
01:16:04,033 --> 01:16:14,300
因为我们已经上月球了 那里没有上帝 但这并不是一个合理的方式

2637
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,933
来对这些体验是关于什么的进行概念化 这些体验是开放的

2638
01:16:20,033 --> 01:16:27,533
那更像是通往另一个维度的开口 这是一种更好的思考方式 这是超越的 从犹太-基督教视角来看

2639
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,633
你必须理解的一点是 上帝超越了空间和时间

2640
01:16:31,666 --> 01:16:33,333
他不在宇宙中

2641
01:16:33,333 --> 01:16:35,066
他以某种方式在宇宙之外

2642
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:48,066
所以 如果你有一个关于上帝的体验 而且是向上的... 向上是人类想象力所能做到的最好的 实际上是一种超维度体验的形式

2643
01:16:48,066 --> 01:16:50,500
或者这是最好的概念化方式

2644
01:16:50,533 --> 01:16:53,100
而且这些体验并不罕见

2645
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,466
它们构成了萨满传统的核心

2646
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:59,266
所以 古老的萨满传统

2647
01:16:59,333 --> 01:17:04,500
这有成千上万年的历史 此时进入了圣经故事

2648
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:12,533
为什么雅各有一个基本上是萨满的体验是很难说的 因为我们不知道这些古人在干什么 对吧

2649
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:20,800
我们不知道多少古老的宗教传统在那个时候还存在

2650
01:17:20,933 --> 01:17:23,800
但我们确实知道我们的古老祖先

2651
01:17:25,033 --> 01:17:29,900
我们的祖先不断使用迷幻物质 比如红斑蝇伞菇

2652
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,933
在它们在印度灭绝之前被广泛使用

2653
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:40,433
这是理论上的 似乎是化学物质苏摩的基础 关于此有很多论述

2654
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:45,500
我们听说这是一个梦境或视觉 也许就是这样

2655
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:51,366
但也许并非如此 也许这是通过萨满人一直以来诱发这些体验的相同过程诱导的体验

2656
01:17:53,366 --> 01:17:58,900
所以我们将稍微探讨一下这个

2657
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,333
天堂与地球之间打开了一个连接

2658
01:18:01,266 --> 01:18:04,733
这就是那个视觉

2659
01:18:05,166 --> 01:18:06,033
有信使在上下移动

2660
01:18:08,533 --> 01:18:09,966
我们可以从心理学角度来概念化这一点 正如我们已经讨论的

2661
01:18:10,266 --> 01:18:14,000
你内在有活跃且生动的力量

2662
01:18:14,433 --> 01:18:19,566
你可以在某种意义上将它们视为更高自我的信使

2663
01:18:20,166 --> 01:18:24,033
所以你可以将这看作是心理现实的一个图像

2664
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,933
但是...

2665
01:18:28,533 --> 01:18:28,700
所以我们可以坚持这一点 但是...

2666
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,966
但是...

2667
01:18:31,966 --> 01:18:32,166
但是...

2668
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,500
以下是一些已做出的阐述

2669
01:18:36,966 --> 01:18:38,433
我真的很喜欢右边的那个

2670
01:18:39,366 --> 01:18:40,266
那是威廉·布莱克

2671
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:42,666
我喜欢螺旋的想法

2672
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:44,166
我不认为那是...

2673
01:18:45,066 --> 01:18:45,733
那是巧合

2674
01:18:45,766 --> 01:18:48,533
有螺旋和双螺旋以及各种图像

2675
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:54,066
非常古老和非常现代的图像 与治疗和这种愿景相关

2676
01:18:55,133 --> 01:19:04,933
所以你在布莱克的阐述中看到 上帝与太阳和光相关联 你也可以看到左边的这个

2677
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:10,200
上帝所在之处就是光所在之处 所以这对我来说也是一个非常有趣的想法

2678
01:19:11,433 --> 01:19:12,833
还有一些其他的阐述

2679
01:19:17,133 --> 01:19:17,833
一个是夏加尔的

2680
01:19:23,633 --> 01:19:31,033
所以现在有这样一个想法 即打开人类心灵与超越神圣之间沟通的可能性

2681
01:19:32,533 --> 01:19:42,733
有一个基督作为全能创造者、世界创造者的的伟大形象 是最早的马赛克之一 如果我记得正确的话 我希望我记得它在哪里 但我不记得了

2682
01:19:43,133 --> 01:19:44,533
但这是一个非常有趣的形象

2683
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,933
我现在正在请我的一个朋友为我制作一件雕刻

2684
01:19:49,866 --> 01:19:58,300
你看到基督的面孔以中世纪的方式被描绘 他手持一本书 所以它象征了书籍的重要性

2685
01:19:58,433 --> 01:20:03,466
作为传递智慧的一种手段 他的面孔非常不对称

2686
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:12,700
眼睛一边和另一边不同 面孔的一半代表人性的一面 而另一边代表神性的一面

2687
01:20:12,866 --> 01:20:18,200
我也从心理学的角度考虑这个 因为我确实认为

2688
01:20:19,133 --> 01:20:29,966
那是概念化人类的正确方式 我们有一部分是凡人和有限的 但我们也有一部分是超越的和神圣的 某种意义上说这是潜在的

2689
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:34,700
但有时候它会显现出来 这不是猜测

2690
01:20:35,933 --> 01:20:39,133
这是人类最古老的经验

2691
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:43,866
这不一定是容易体验到的 但它无处不在

2692
01:20:44,266 --> 01:20:50,033
并且可以像我们之前讨论的那样通过化学手段可靠地诱导 我不知道这到底意味着什么

2693
01:20:50,466 --> 01:20:53,133
我们已经稍微讨论了一下颇洛西宾蘑菇 例如

2694
01:20:53,233 --> 01:21:08,233
你可以说约翰霍普金斯最新实验中引发的神秘体验是精神错乱或精神病态的形式 因为它们与精神病态体验有一些相似性

2695
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:15,000
所以 60年代给精神病患者服用了LSD 他们总是说那和他们的体验不同

2696
01:21:15,433 --> 01:21:18,700
如果给精神病患者服用安非他命 你可以使他们的病情恶化

2697
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,633
所以它们在生化上是分开的 我们知道这一点

2698
01:21:22,233 --> 01:21:28,600
但是 关于颇洛西宾体验的有趣之处在于 它们可靠地产生神秘体验

2699
01:21:28,733 --> 01:21:31,833
那些人将其评为他们一生中最重要的体验之一

2700
01:21:32,566 --> 01:21:38,366
而且 那些有过迷幻体验的人 会发生积极的事情

2701
01:21:38,766 --> 01:21:41,566
所以这有点搅乱了整个精神病理论 对吧

2702
01:21:41,633 --> 01:21:42,633
因为 你要怎么办

2703
01:21:42,666 --> 01:21:46,800
你要声称你给某人一颗药丸 他们有了精神病性发作 然后他们变得更健康

2704
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,233
就像 不是

2705
01:21:48,266 --> 01:21:49,833
那不是精神病性发作的工作方式

2706
01:21:50,333 --> 01:21:51,800
你在经历了一次之后不会更健康

2707
01:21:52,333 --> 01:21:55,700
你就像 你是个破碎的蛋 把你重新拼凑起来并不容易

2708
01:21:56,500 --> 01:22:02,866
所以 我们知道全世界的人们发现了各种各样你可能想象得到的迷幻物质

2709
01:22:03,766 --> 01:22:08,866
好吧 你想象有很多饥饿的人在地球上漫游很长时间 他们吃了他们能够得到的每一样东西

2710
01:22:09,433 --> 01:22:12,800
偶尔因此发生了一些非常奇特的事情

2711
01:22:13,733 --> 01:22:23,600
所以 所以我要告诉你一些关于萨满传统的事情 因为它与雅各的梯子有关

2712
01:22:24,533 --> 01:22:33,166
根据米尔恰·伊利亚德 他是宗教的伟大历史学家 荣格的同胞 他们相互影响颇深

2713
01:22:33,533 --> 01:22:40,766
伊利亚德认为使用迷幻药物的萨满教是从最初更纯粹的萨满教退化而来的

2714
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:53,366
但我认为后来的学术研究已经表明这是不正确的 萨满仪式本身是使用、发现和仪式性使用迷幻物质的直接后果

2715
01:22:53,433 --> 01:23:07,066
但无论如何 伊利亚德确定了通向萨满教的三条路径 萨满教在部落中 比普通人更受教育 词汇量更大

2716
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,266
并且是口头传统的储藏库

2717
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,466
因此 学会了所有透过口口相传的故事

2718
01:23:15,633 --> 01:23:21,566
顺便说一下 人们非常非常能够在几代人之间非常准确地讲述相同的故事

2719
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,200
这已经得到了相当好的文献记录

2720
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:29,000
所以那些不会阅读的人真的能记住 因为他们还能做什么呢

2721
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:34,933
他们的记忆力远超现代人 因为我们可以忘记一切 因为我们可以随时查找

2722
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:40,266
但他们记住事情是因为他们别无选择 我父亲认识一个人是文盲

2723
01:23:41,233 --> 01:23:47,366
而且也不会使用数字 当他在萨斯喀彻温省长大的时候

2724
01:23:48,133 --> 01:23:53,966
六十年前 他有绵羊 如果我没记错的话 尽管他不会数数

2725
01:23:54,166 --> 01:23:57,166
他知道如果他的一只羊失踪了--因为他认识所有的羊--

2726
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:02,466
所以他一看就能知道是否有一只羊失踪了 但他本身不会数数

2727
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:08,133
那么 没有我们特定技能的人 首先他们不傻 其次

2728
01:24:08,233 --> 01:24:14,766
他们有我们不理解的其他技能来填补空白 所以Eliade确定了自发的召唤

2729
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:19,900
就是你有萨满的精神 比如说你在开放性方面可能非常高

2730
01:24:20,033 --> 01:24:23,066
从现代的角度来说是遗传的

2731
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:30,833
所以你的父亲是萨满 你的祖父是萨满 等等 你被引入那个过程或个人追求

2732
01:24:33,233 --> 01:24:39,966
在西伯利亚 这是来自Eliana 被召做萨满的青年会因其奇怪的行为引人注意

2733
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:46,966
例如 他寻求孤独 变得心不在焉 喜欢在树林或人迹罕至的地方漫游 有幻觉并在睡梦中唱歌

2734
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:57,000
如果你把某人放在一个感官剥夺的地方 正常人很快就会产生幻觉

2735
01:24:58,366 --> 01:25:05,000
所以似乎如果你减少感官输入 那么你开始意识到你心智的背景过程

2736
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:05,966
就像那样

2737
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,266
就像信号与噪声比例

2738
01:25:08,266 --> 01:25:09,200
我得弄清楚这点

2739
01:25:10,533 --> 01:25:19,833
随着噪声减少 一些噪声变成了信号 背景噪声变成了信号 你开始意识到你自己的内在心理过程

2740
01:25:19,866 --> 01:25:20,733
就是这样

2741
01:25:21,466 --> 01:25:23,666
他在睡梦中有幻觉并唱歌

2742
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:27,966
在某些情况下 这种孵化期被相当严重的症状标记 例如在雅库特人中

2743
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:34,233
这个年轻人有时会发作狂怒 并容易失去意识 藏匿在森林中 以树皮为食

2744
01:25:34,733 --> 01:25:37,933
跳入水中和火中 并用刀子割伤自己

2745
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:45,300
大约一年前 我们去了北温哥华岛上的一个potlatch

2746
01:25:45,433 --> 01:25:48,166
他们表演了一种舞蹈 是夸库瓦卡瓦克人的原住民

2747
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:53,066
他们有这个有趣的舞蹈 是野人的舞蹈 所以

2748
01:25:53,966 --> 01:25:56,766
邀请我们的人就是野人 他穿着树枝等装束

2749
01:25:57,966 --> 01:26:01,733
他就是那个在丛林中待得太久的人

2750
01:26:01,833 --> 01:26:09,566
他以食人族的身份出现 这些人不久前还有真正的食人族仪式

2751
01:26:09,733 --> 01:26:14,966
他以食人族的身份出现 每个人都必须戴上这种雪松头饰 因为如果你戴上雪松头饰

2752
01:26:15,366 --> 01:26:16,833
食人族就不会咬你一口

2753
01:26:16,933 --> 01:26:19,033
他们实际上相当认真地对待这个

2754
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:23,266
所以你应该戴上你的雪松头饰 所以他环视人群

2755
01:26:23,433 --> 01:26:26,833
这个地方有大约400人 他的表演也非常到位

2756
01:26:27,033 --> 01:26:30,966
所以他表演这个野人舞蹈 然后所有的女性都站起来

2757
01:26:31,733 --> 01:26:37,366
并开始原地跳舞并唱歌 她们在驯服他 这真的很酷

2758
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:42,733
看到这个真的很有趣 因为这些人大约有13000年的未中断文化

2759
01:26:43,566 --> 01:26:51,700
那就是他们在那个岛上的时间 看到这种男性被女性驯化的戏剧化表现非常有趣

2760
01:26:51,833 --> 01:26:54,266
在那个舞蹈中以这种方式展现出来的女性

2761
01:26:54,900 --> 01:27:00,733
但这也与萨满传统有关 因为他以野人的身份出现 对吧 他必须以某种方式被重新文明化 被重新带回地面

2762
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,833
所以

2763
01:27:06,166 --> 01:27:06,300
所以

2764
01:27:07,433 --> 01:27:14,466
但无论通过什么方法 只有在接受了两种教育方式之后 他才被认可为萨满

2765
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:22,566
第一种是狂喜的梦境、恍惚、幻象 这个人告诉我的另一件事--我没有理由怀疑他--

2766
01:27:24,133 --> 01:27:25,700
他也是一个不识字的人

2767
01:27:26,733 --> 01:27:27,700
所以记忆力很好

2768
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:29,666
他做传统雕刻

2769
01:27:30,166 --> 01:27:31,200
而且他做得很好

2770
01:27:31,733 --> 01:27:37,266
他雕刻了一根53英尺的图腾柱 现在在蒙特利尔市中心的艺术博物馆前面

2771
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:39,333
所以如果你去那里 你可以去看看

2772
01:27:39,966 --> 01:27:41,700
它不会永远在那里 但现在在那里

2773
01:27:43,033 --> 01:27:45,700
而且 呃 他是由他的祖父母教他雕刻的

2774
01:27:45,866 --> 01:27:54,400
他说 他做梦时 海达图像是什么样的 所以夸库瓦卡瓦克人有点像海达人 有同样的图像

2775
01:27:54,866 --> 01:28:00,133
他告诉我 他在那些图像中做梦 所以当他做梦时 那就是他所梦到的事物所采取的形式

2776
01:28:00,766 --> 01:28:09,166
他还说他会在梦中与祖父母交谈 所以如果他在雕刻一块木头并试图弄清楚如何雕刻它 并且

2777
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:17,233
遇到了特别困难的问题 他会做梦 并与祖父母进行对话 他们会帮助他弄清楚如何解决问题 然后他醒来就能去雕刻...

2778
01:28:17,633 --> 01:28:24,066
他跟我说这些事的时候 是挺真实的 就像的 我的意思是 不像是...

2779
01:28:25,066 --> 01:28:27,800
虽然他确实跟我提到了一些奇怪的事情

2780
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,266
在某种程度上 他确实这么做了

2781
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:34,500
我问了他很多关于他雕刻了什么以及这一切意味着什么的问题

2782
01:28:35,766 --> 01:28:38,033
那只是他解释他是怎么做的一部分

2783
01:28:38,166 --> 01:28:41,633
他为我雕刻了几扇我家里的门

2784
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:44,600
其中一扇非常有趣

2785
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,366
嗯 这两扇门合起来是一个面板

2786
01:28:48,266 --> 01:28:54,333
它们是一个水下场景 在水下有很多的神话怪物 其中一些是虎鲸

2787
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,800
我记得下面还有一只章鱼 雕刻成这种特别的风格

2788
01:28:57,866 --> 01:29:03,100
他说 他梦到的另一件事是他会下到水底去 那里有

2789
01:29:03,233 --> 01:29:09,266
这些神话生物 他从它们那里获得灵感 所以我觉得这也极其有趣

2790
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:14,333
我们不知道一个没有过度文明化的心智

2791
01:29:14,333 --> 01:29:14,666
比方说

2792
01:29:15,933 --> 01:29:20,166
过度文化 像我们的心智一样 因为我们被外部刺激所轰炸

2793
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:25,866
我们真的不知道自然心智是什么样的 所以听他说这些也很有趣

2794
01:29:26,833 --> 01:29:31,066
听他讲述这些 同时也看到了后果 因为他确实是一个很棒的

2795
01:29:31,066 --> 01:29:31,966
他确实是一个非常伟大的雕刻家

2796
01:29:33,033 --> 01:29:40,166
所以第一个是狂喜的梦境、幻觉、视觉 第二个是传统的萨满技巧 精神的名字和功能

2797
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:48,433
部落的神话和谱系 一种秘密语言 这双重教学由精神和老萨满传授 构成了入门

2798
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:57,833
所以 现代人在这方面有问题 因为我们真的没有被启蒙 但我想说

2799
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:03,266
假设我们每个人都在进行某种探索

2800
01:30:03,666 --> 01:30:07,200
我认为 如果你不是这样的话 你不会在这里 因为你还有什么其他理由在这里呢

2801
01:30:08,933 --> 01:30:13,500
所以你在进行某种探索 试图理解生命的意义

2802
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:15,400
比方说

2803
01:30:15,466 --> 01:30:20,933
你不想独自做这件事 因为你只能活大约70年 靠自己好运去弄明白吧

2804
01:30:21,433 --> 01:30:22,366
这根本不可能发生

2805
01:30:22,466 --> 01:30:23,266
这太复杂了

2806
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,366
而且你会感到太孤立 对吧

2807
01:30:25,833 --> 01:30:27,933
如果只有你自己 那就是疯狂

2808
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:29,433
没人能忍受那样

2809
01:30:29,933 --> 01:30:34,166
所以你希望其他人有东西可以告诉你 你的文化有东西可以告诉你

2810
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:39,433
所以你在进行一次探索 可能不像萨满的入门者那样强烈

2811
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:40,933
但 让我们给你一些赞誉

2812
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:47,566
然后你也在试图理解过去的智慧 这是第二部分

2813
01:30:48,033 --> 01:30:50,500
就像 好吧 你是一个人类 人类一直在讲故事

2814
01:30:50,633 --> 01:30:55,400
很长一段时间 试图弄明白发生了什么 试图理解如何在世界中定位自己

2815
01:30:55,500 --> 01:31:04,800
所以 你在这里做的部分事情 正是萨满入门者在过程的第二部分所做的

2816
01:31:04,933 --> 01:31:12,100
那就是尽可能让自己接触到精神的名字和功能、部落的神话和谱系、以及秘密语言

2817
01:31:12,933 --> 01:31:17,800
这双重教学 由精神和老萨满传授 构成了入门

2818
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:20,600
所以这是一种重生 对吧

2819
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:22,933
这就是入门的意义

2820
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:28,433
这是再次出生 这是精神而非身体的出生

2821
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:31,833
就是这样 因此这是一个综合心理的重生

2822
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:40,766
这是一种思考方式 一个既是个体的心理 但也植根于共同的人性 共同人性的智慧中

2823
01:31:41,366 --> 01:31:45,566
这会让你变强 或至少让你更强壮 因为力量是有限的

2824
01:31:45,633 --> 01:31:49,500
但只有上帝知道那个限度在哪里

2825
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,066
人们可以难以置信地坚韧

2826
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:53,633
难以置信的坚韧

2827
01:31:53,666 --> 01:31:59,800
我认为 人类之所以令人钦佩的坚韧 因为我们非常清楚我们可以被伤害

2828
01:32:00,433 --> 01:32:07,666
我们非常清楚那种伤害会导致什么  你的家人可能会被带走 你可以被摧毁

2829
01:32:07,866 --> 01:32:13,400
而事实上 你能在面对这一切时保持勇敢 这是完全难以置信的 对吧

2830
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:17,933
我认为 人们应该得到更多的赞赏 比人们给自己的要多

2831
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:27,966
因为事实上 我们在生死之间的条件下 在痛苦中 可以保持尊严 这是对人类精神的证明

2832
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:34,766
我认为 我们的文化中存在一种深刻的反人类情绪

2833
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:38,800
认为人类是地球上的癌症 之类的

2834
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:40,533
认为我们的人数应该更少

2835
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:46,300
这是和写《最好未曾存在》这本书的人有相同动机的精神

2836
01:32:47,066 --> 01:32:50,866
我不这么看 我的意思是 我认为鉴于

2837
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:55,433
鉴于人们一只腿被熊陷阱夹住 头被老虎钳夹住的情况下

2838
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:59,700
他们实际上做得相当好 因为生活真的很艰难

2839
01:33:00,233 --> 01:33:09,433
我们并没有一直绝对残酷和凶残 鉴于我们实际上必须面对的 这真的很了不起 我们可以努力诚实、慷慨和利他

2840
01:33:10,133 --> 01:33:18,766
并在难以置信的恶劣环境下彼此关怀 有时在最艰难的条件下表现得高尚

2841
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,066
在索尔仁尼琴的《古拉格群岛》中

2842
01:33:21,166 --> 01:33:30,066
他讲述了一个又一个人表现得极其恶劣的故事 但也有在最糟糕的威胁下 从未牺牲自己品格的人

2843
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:32,100
阅读关于这方面的故事真的是……

2844
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:37,000
嗯 这真的让人深思

2845
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:37,600
就是这样

2846
01:33:38,733 --> 01:33:44,100
逼近成熟期的东乡族未来萨满 会经历一场歇斯底里或近乎歇斯底里的危机

2847
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,933
但有时他们的职业表现会在更早的年龄显现

2848
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:49,966
这个男孩逃到山里 在那里待上一周或更久

2849
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:52,766
以自己的牙齿撕裂动物为食

2850
01:33:54,700 --> 01:34:01,066
他回到村庄时 浑身肮脏 血迹斑斑 过了十天或更久之后 他才开始含糊其辞地说话

2851
01:34:02,533 --> 01:34:06,066
未来萨满的奇怪行为引起了学者们的注意

2852
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:11,066
从上个世纪中叶开始 已经有几次尝试将这种现象解释为一种精神疾病

2853
01:34:11,966 --> 01:34:21,100
但问题提得不对 因为一方面 并非所有萨满都是或必须是神经病患者 精神错乱的

2854
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:28,100
另一方面 这才是关键问题 那些曾经病过的人之所以成为萨满 正是因为他们成功地治愈了自己

2855
01:34:29,233 --> 01:34:40,066
所以 不是沉入这种奇异的地下心理状态构成了变化 使得一个人成为萨满 而是从那种状态中重新浮现 爬出

2856
01:34:40,133 --> 01:34:43,500
那是一次到冥界的旅行 和一次重生 对吗

2857
01:34:43,533 --> 01:34:45,300
所以 还有这本伟大的书

2858
01:34:45,833 --> 01:34:56,233
这是一本伟大的书 作者叫亨利·艾伦·伯格 他是一位存在主义精神分析家和哲学家 他写了一本名为《发现无意识》的书 我强烈推荐

2859
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:58,333
它在我的推荐阅读列表上

2860
01:34:58,366 --> 01:34:59,733
这是一本伟大的书

2861
01:34:59,733 --> 01:35:02,800
如果你想了解精神分析传统

2862
01:35:04,433 --> 01:35:11,266
这是最好的入门书籍 他讨论了阿德勒、荣格和弗洛伊德 并且非常可信地完成了这三部分

2863
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:19,333
但也将精神分析思想的历史追溯到弗洛伊德之前三四百年 所以它是非常吸引人的阅读材料

2864
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:24,366
非常有趣 艾伦·伯格清楚地指出

2865
01:35:25,133 --> 01:35:36,866
明确地 他在某种程度上将这与萨满传统联系起来 弗洛伊德和尤其是荣格经历了非常激烈的心理障碍时期 可以这么说

2866
01:35:36,866 --> 01:35:46,766
我想说的是 因为他们在最基本的层面上质疑他们的公理 他们在干扰他们的认知和感知结构 对吗

2867
01:35:46,766 --> 01:35:52,800
荣格还在尝试使用想象技巧 有关视觉的技巧 他做了很多

2868
01:35:52,833 --> 01:35:59,566
在他生命中的一个时期 他持续经历着一连串的幻象 他在一本书中写下了这些

2869
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:07,833
叫做《红书》 但同时他还在作为一个精神病医生在世界上正常发挥作用

2870
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:11,366
所以 有的建议说 人应该经历了一次精神崩溃 但那是荒谬的

2871
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:18,333
因为不是这样的 如果你正在经历精神崩溃 你不可能成为一个有效的精神病医生

2872
01:36:18,433 --> 01:36:21,933
这些事情不可能同时发生 特别是不可能长时间这样

2873
01:36:22,333 --> 01:36:29,300
所以存在没有精神病、精神病理的极端经历的可能性

2874
01:36:30,266 --> 01:36:30,433
而且

2875
01:36:31,033 --> 01:36:39,166
艾伦·伯格也对弗洛伊德和查尔斯·达尔文有相似的看法 他也经历了一段可怕的心理障碍期

2876
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:48,100
我会说这是由于他提出进化论理论的后果 这对他来说真的很难 因为他是个坚定的基督徒

2877
01:36:48,433 --> 01:36:54,466
他知道他的理论含义是什么 他不知道该怎么办

2878
01:36:54,633 --> 01:36:56,166
所以这对他来说非常非常困难

2879
01:36:56,266 --> 01:37:02,533
所以 天才人物经历激烈的心理危机是相当常见的

2880
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:06,566
但解决它 天才在于解决方案 对吗

2881
01:37:06,866 --> 01:37:12,033
天才的前提在某种意义上是分解 因为你必须对问题着迷

2882
01:37:12,066 --> 01:37:15,333
问题必须完全吸引你 你才会专注于它

2883
01:37:15,433 --> 01:37:28,666
如此执着地 你可能会想出解决方案 提出解决方案的人是先知和萨满等等 这不是只有古代文化才有的特征

2884
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:32,100
我们只是没有正确识别我们自己文化中的这一点

2885
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:33,600
那是个问题

2886
01:37:34,533 --> 01:37:35,433
嗯 有时候我们确实做到了

2887
01:37:37,533 --> 01:37:41,166
对 你记得《狮子王》里 对吗 拉菲奇出现了

2888
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:48,466
他是萨满 他带领辛巴走过那条黑暗的隧道 那是心灵的黑夜

2889
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:53,033
他让辛巴在水池中反思自己 当他深入反思自己时

2890
01:37:53,066 --> 01:37:59,600
他看到了他父亲的倒影 那成为了一个宇宙级重要的事情 他的父亲出现在天空中

2891
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:09,633
就像上帝对雅各出现一样 基本上告诉他是时候成长起来 回到被毁灭的王国 去纠正它

2892
01:38:10,633 --> 01:38:12,933
所以 那是对的

2893
01:38:12,966 --> 01:38:13,833
那完全正确

2894
01:38:13,833 --> 01:38:15,600
我的意思是 我们生活在一个被摧毁的王国里

2895
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:21,866
这是一个永恒的真理 个人的责任是成长起来并且纠正它

2896
01:38:22,733 --> 01:38:27,566
因为当它被摧毁 当事物不在其位时 每个人都会受苦太多

2897
01:38:28,366 --> 01:38:33,200
那不好 没有借口不做些什么来改变它 因为你没有更好的事情要做

2898
01:38:34,333 --> 01:38:34,466
所以

2899
01:38:36,033 --> 01:38:39,166
甚至连儿童电影都告诉你这一点

2900
01:38:40,066 --> 01:38:44,433
所以 这是个有趣的话题

2901
01:38:45,433 --> 01:38:48,600
这来自Eadwine Salter 9到12世纪的

2902
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:57,166
那是亚当和夏娃 但有猜测说他们吃的那个果实 你看 是魔蘑菇

2903
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:01,166
因为它们是唯一一种那样生长的蘑菇

2904
01:39:02,466 --> 01:39:04,933
所以你可能会说 这相当疯狂

2905
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:10,533
然后 这是 我认为它被称为Banisteria Vine 如果我没记错的话

2906
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:15,866
它是制作死藤水的原料 它有这种双螺旋形状 非常非常有趣

2907
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:24,366
当地人 没有人能弄清楚他们是如何制作这种死藤水的 这种死藤水在精神上能强烈地迷幻人们

2908
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:29,100
这上面建立了一个完整的宗教 像一个现代宗教以及古老的宗教

2909
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:33,866
要制作这种东西 他们必须使用两种彼此不在附近生长的植物

2910
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:40,366
亚马逊有大概一百万种植物 那你怎么找出来 没人知道 然后你得煮它们

2911
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:45,566
用一种非常特别的方式煮一定的时间才能制作出这种东西

2912
01:39:45,666 --> 01:39:47,500
所以其中一种植物含有DMT

2913
01:39:47,633 --> 01:39:53,366
这是一种非常强烈的迷幻药物 但它作用时间很短 而另一种含有MAO抑制剂

2914
01:39:53,533 --> 01:39:56,100
所以如果你服用DMT和MAO抑制剂

2915
01:39:56,533 --> 01:39:59,766
那么DMT的旅程会持续更长时间

2916
01:40:00,266 --> 01:40:03,200
所以这是这些亚马逊土著人弄清楚的 而且没有人知道他们是如何做到的

2917
01:40:03,733 --> 01:40:06,733
如果你问他们 他们会告诉你是植物 告诉你他们怎么做的

2918
01:40:07,033 --> 01:40:10,200
对现代人来说 这几乎不算是一个解释

2919
01:40:10,366 --> 01:40:16,700
但当现代人服用死藤水 可以说植物开始和他们交谈时

2920
01:40:17,033 --> 01:40:22,766
他们对整个理论 即植物与此有关的理论 就不那么怀疑了 这些事情

2921
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:27,800
关于这些我不太愿意讨论 因为我不是药物使用的倡导者

2922
01:40:28,433 --> 01:40:31,666
但同样 你不能忽视实证数据

2923
01:40:31,666 --> 01:40:32,500
这是不合理的

2924
01:40:33,433 --> 01:40:40,000
而且实证数据显示迷幻药物可以产生神秘体验 这些体验通常具有转变性效果

2925
01:40:40,133 --> 01:40:44,066
我的意思是 最新的研究显示 如果你对患有癌症晚期的人

2926
01:40:44,233 --> 01:40:52,033
使用足够剂量的魔蘑菇产生神秘体验 你可以显著减少他们的死亡恐惧

2927
01:40:53,133 --> 01:40:53,400
就像

2928
01:40:54,866 --> 01:40:56,233
你得思考这个问题 伙计

2929
01:40:56,266 --> 01:40:56,400
那是

2930
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:59,833
那是艰难的 这是个艰难的实验

2931
01:40:59,866 --> 01:41:04,133
你只是不会想到 你让一个人变得疯狂混乱

2932
01:41:04,933 --> 01:41:09,933
但当他们回来时 他们虽然将死 却不那么害怕死亡了

2933
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:17,866
当你看到这样的事情时 你得醒来闻闻玫瑰的味道（注意并欣赏他们周围的美好事物或现实生活中正在发生的事情） 而且进行这项研究的人是非常可靠的人

2934
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:21,766
还有毒蝇伞菌

2935
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:23,133
有这样一个古老的想法

2936
01:41:23,133 --> 01:41:24,933
这是一个相当有趣的想法 蘑菇

2937
01:41:24,933 --> 01:41:31,733
所以 苍蝇喜欢毒蝇伞 还有一些 这很荒谬 有些证据表明

2938
01:41:31,866 --> 01:41:36,700
实际上它们喜欢被迷醉 因为动物会吃这些

2939
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:41,000
比如驯鹿也会吃这些东西 它们也会被这些东西弄得相当迷糊 所以我有这本书

2940
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:48,233
关于动物之间的迷幻药物使用 这是一本小书 但是 所以 有这样一个想法

2941
01:41:48,533 --> 01:42:01,266
蟾蜍常围绕毒蝇伞坐着 等待被迷醉的苍蝇笨拙地在它们周围飞来飞去 然后一把抓住它们 所以我觉得这很有趣

2942
01:42:02,033 --> 01:42:08,733
美国有些蘑菇是地球上最古老的生物 嘿 有一种蘑菇

2943
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:14,700
我不记得它在哪里了 但它覆盖的面积大约 哦天哪 我不知道 像数百平方英里那么大

2944
01:42:14,966 --> 01:42:19,933
它是如此巨大 因为它全部在地下 对吧 它们有这些非常复杂的网络

2945
01:42:21,133 --> 01:42:26,266
被称为菌丝体 他们认为这东西大概有一百五十万年历史 类似这样的

2946
01:42:27,233 --> 01:42:30,533
有很多关于世界的事情我们不知道 这是肯定的

2947
01:42:32,133 --> 01:42:37,400
这是经典迷幻药物的化学结构 你看它们都有相同的基本结构

2948
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:38,866
这是血清素

2949
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:41,433
那是大脑的主要神经递质之一

2950
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:53,433
所以迷幻药物发挥作用的方式是 它们通过改变大脑对血清素的神经化学利用

2951
01:42:53,633 --> 01:42:56,333
改变血清素系统的工作方式

2952
01:42:56,533 --> 01:42:59,733
血清素系统是一个非常基本的系统

2953
01:42:59,766 --> 01:43:02,466
因为当你是一个胚胎 你的大脑在发育时

2954
01:43:02,533 --> 01:43:06,700
是血清素投射基本上指挥你的大脑发展

2955
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:10,766
所以它们是 而且它们是非常古老的电路 非常非常古老的电路

2956
01:43:11,466 --> 01:43:11,600
所以

2957
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,633
这是文章 我想我从这里偷来的

2958
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:25,833
格里菲斯的魔蘑菇 他做了很多这方面的研究 魔蘑菇可以引发具有重大且持久个人意义和精神意义的神秘体验

2959
01:43:26,966 --> 01:43:27,100
所以

2960
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:28,566
为什么

2961
01:43:30,233 --> 01:43:33,533
这是个好问题 对吧 所以这里有个问题给你

2962
01:43:33,933 --> 01:43:37,333
毫无疑问 人类能够体验宗教经验

2963
01:43:38,933 --> 01:43:39,133
为什么

2964
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:44,366
这到底是为什么呢 你可以将其与精神病关联

2965
01:43:44,733 --> 01:43:48,866
但那行不通 因为这理论站不住脚 理论无法成立

2966
01:43:48,866 --> 01:43:49,666
这不是同一回事

2967
01:43:50,633 --> 01:43:52,166
那究竟是为什么呢

2968
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:56,566
这不是一件容易弄清楚的事 就像我一直在试图弄明白的

2969
01:43:56,766 --> 01:43:59,600
我总是在尝试为一切找到一个生物学上的解释 因为

2970
01:44:00,233 --> 01:44:03,833
如果你想找到一个可以依靠的东西 你要确保它能抵抗挑战

2971
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:10,133
所以如果我能找到一个可以还原且物质的、生物学的解释 我就会选择那个

2972
01:44:10,733 --> 01:44:11,433
那是个难题

2973
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,600
意识是个难题 道德感是个难题

2974
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:18,300
这些不是容易破解的东西 大爆炸也是个难题

2975
01:44:19,366 --> 01:44:19,500
所以

2976
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,833
我的意思是 一个愤世嫉俗的人可能会说也许

2977
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:34,666
有时人们接近自杀时会有一次神秘体验 也许你会说 嗯

2978
01:44:34,766 --> 01:44:44,000
这是你的大脑最后一搏 试图欺骗你认为你的生活有某种意义 这是一个合理的理论

2979
01:44:45,233 --> 01:44:48,233
但我认为它无法解释现象的普遍性

2980
01:44:49,266 --> 01:44:49,400
所以

2981
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:52,200
所以我不接受它

2982
01:44:57,033 --> 01:44:58,133
在萨满教中发生了什么

2983
01:45:00,433 --> 01:45:05,633
萨满的经历首先是体验到自己被化为骨架

2984
01:45:05,666 --> 01:45:12,666
所以 一次非常真实的死亡体验 然后接下来发生的是

2985
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:18,933
他发现自己处于一个地方 在那里他与他的祖先灵魂沟通 然后

2986
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:33,300
之后就是爬升某种梯子 比如说雅各的梯子 和上帝进行面对面的邂逅 这是非常广泛的

2987
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:43,400
那是世界树 我对此思考了很多 试图弄明白这代表什么

2988
01:45:43,833 --> 01:45:50,100
根据一位来自西伯利亚的雅库特通报者的说法 灵魂将未来的萨满带到地狱 并将他关在一间屋子里三年

2989
01:45:50,633 --> 01:45:52,066
在这里他经历了他的启蒙

2990
01:45:52,300 --> 01:46:02,433
灵魂切下他的头颅 放在一边 因为新手必须亲眼看着自己被肢解 某种意义上解体成基本元素 并且

2991
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:06,333
将他的身体切成碎片 这些碎片后来分给了各种疾病的灵魂

2992
01:46:07,133 --> 01:46:10,366
只有在这个条件下 未来的萨满才能获得治愈的力量

2993
01:46:10,900 --> 01:46:14,933
他的骨头然后被新肉覆盖 在某些情况下他还会被赋予新血

2994
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:18,966
所以这是一种与萨满仪式相关的死而复生的体验

2995
01:46:24,066 --> 01:46:27,800
我们在这里面对一个非常古老的宗教观念 它属于狩猎文化

2996
01:46:28,733 --> 01:46:32,766
它象征着动物生命的最终根源 肉体不断涌现的模具

2997
01:46:34,166 --> 01:46:36,700
人和动物从骨头中重生

2998
01:46:36,833 --> 01:46:44,533
他们在肉体存在中暂时地维持自己 然后他们死去 他们的生命被减少到集中在骨骼中的精髓 从中他们将再次诞生

2999
01:46:49,366 --> 01:46:51,800
这是对经验的一个很好的图形表示

3000
01:46:55,066 --> 01:46:58,366
那是一幅古老的画作 我想是希罗尼穆斯·博斯画的 如果我没记错的话

3001
01:46:59,133 --> 01:47:05,466
我真的很喜欢那幅画 因为它让人想起你听人们描述的濒死体验 它们也相当普遍

3002
01:47:06,233 --> 01:47:11,933
我曾有过一次非常奇怪的经历 我想我还没告诉过你们这个故事

3003
01:47:11,933 --> 01:47:17,333
我在评估一个经历了车祸 头部穿透挡风玻璃的人 他非常抑郁

3004
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:28,166
这已经发生很久了 但他非常抑郁 因为他抑郁了这么长时间 保险公司指控他装病 认为他已经痊愈了

3005
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:32,033
但如果你的左半球受损 特别是你左半球的前部

3006
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:39,266
那么你可能会处于一种慢性抑郁状态 因为左半球通常来说负责正面情绪

3007
01:47:39,333 --> 01:47:42,066
所以如果它不在那里 那就像对你来说全是负面情绪

3008
01:47:42,833 --> 01:47:45,400
所以我去评估他 我给他做了这个

3009
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:56,766
我想是叫做MMPI 明尼苏达多项人格清单 这是一种标准的一半是人格测试 一半是精神病理测试

3010
01:47:58,433 --> 01:47:59,433
他在填写它

3011
01:47:59,466 --> 01:48:01,733
他是个非常严肃的人 中年男子

3012
01:48:01,766 --> 01:48:04,666
他一点也不新时代（New Agey）

3013
01:48:04,866 --> 01:48:06,066
他就像一个会计

3014
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:07,266
我想事实上

3015
01:48:07,266 --> 01:48:08,633
如果我没记错的话 他是个会计

3016
01:48:09,733 --> 01:48:09,866
而且

3017
01:48:11,133 --> 01:48:15,900
有一个问题 它说我的灵魂已经离开我的身体

3018
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:17,833
我认为这是对的

3019
01:48:17,833 --> 01:48:22,300
非常接近 他停下来问我

3020
01:48:22,333 --> 01:48:23,966
他说他不确定如何回答这个问题 然后

3021
01:48:25,533 --> 01:48:28,766
所以我说为什么 他说因为在他经历车祸穿越挡风玻璃后

3022
01:48:28,933 --> 01:48:33,000
他昏迷了三周左右 像那样 他说他死了

3023
01:48:33,033 --> 01:48:34,833
我认为他说他死了三次 然后

3024
01:48:35,833 --> 01:48:37,366
他说他能记得

3025
01:48:38,633 --> 01:48:41,900
在那段时间他什么都记不起来 他也记不起车祸

3026
01:48:41,933 --> 01:48:42,900
那是逆行性遗忘症

3027
01:48:43,033 --> 01:48:53,800
这在头部受伤时非常常见 他说在那些经历中的一次 这也是他从医院记得的所有事情 是他离开了自己的身体然后

3028
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:59,833
走下了长长的光之隧道 你们听过这些濒死体验 然后看到了他的家人在那里 还有

3029
01:49:00,733 --> 01:49:05,733
看到了天堂之光 然后意识到不是他的时间 就回到了自己的身体

3030
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:12,166
现在这个人有趣的地方在于 首先我没有问他这个问题 对吧

3031
01:49:12,366 --> 01:49:18,333
他基本上是自愿讲述这个故事的 这是由这个问题引发的 而且

3032
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:25,933
他不知道其他人是否也有过这样的经历 因为我问他是否听说过这样的事

3033
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:31,633
他说没有 那很有趣 但真正有趣的是他怎么会记得那个

3034
01:49:33,066 --> 01:49:36,033
对吧 因为他在那整段时间都有遗忘症

3035
01:49:36,066 --> 01:49:36,900
他处于昏迷状态

3036
01:49:37,366 --> 01:49:39,433
就像他什么都不记得

3037
01:49:39,466 --> 01:49:40,200
他记得那个

3038
01:49:41,366 --> 01:49:41,633
所以

3039
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:47,000
这些体验比你想象的更常见

3040
01:49:47,033 --> 01:49:48,800
然后有一幅画 是其中一种

3041
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,300
挺有趣的 那就像通往天堂的隧道

3042
01:49:52,333 --> 01:49:53,366
基本思想是相同的

3043
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:58,366
这幅画中有一点更多的苦难 我认为 但这很典型地符合希罗尼穆斯·博斯的风格

3044
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:00,366
我的意思是 我不知道那家伙怎么了 但

3045
01:50:01,333 --> 01:50:06,933
他是一个很奇怪的角色 现在斯堪的纳维亚人有这样一个观点

3046
01:50:07,466 --> 01:50:12,833
世界是一棵树 我对此思考了很多 我认为

3047
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:19,533
树的概念 树是一种扎根于物质中的东西 可以说

3048
01:50:19,566 --> 01:50:22,666
并且向天堂伸展 在斯堪的纳维亚的树的底部--

3049
01:50:22,733 --> 01:50:26,666
有一个很酷的想法--那棵树不断地被蛇咬

3050
01:50:26,866 --> 01:50:35,333
你可以在底部看到蛇 同时它被水浇灌 水使得树以蛇咬其根部的相同速率生长

3051
01:50:35,900 --> 01:50:37,300
所以这就像一个阴阳的概念

3052
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:43,066
那里持续的混乱破坏和替代是这个过程的基础

3053
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:46,433
但树在我看来代表的不仅仅是

3054
01:50:47,333 --> 01:50:50,100
它像是一个不同维度的空间

3055
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:54,600
那就是所尝试表现的 所以想象你的结构

3056
01:50:55,700 --> 01:51:02,633
如果你按照10的幂次放大 比如说人类大约位于最小的事物和最大的事物的中间

3057
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:04,566
如果你按照10的幂次进行

3058
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:09,633
那么 你有一个亚原子级别和一个原子级别以及一个分子级别

3059
01:51:09,633 --> 01:51:14,400
然后 然后是一个器官的级别

3060
01:51:14,633 --> 01:51:16,533
然后有你 然后有你的家庭

3061
01:51:16,633 --> 01:51:20,433
以此类推 一直向上延伸到树的顶端

3062
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:26,466
所以我认为这棵树代表的 这就是萨满上下移动的东西

3063
01:51:26,933 --> 01:51:28,433
我认为这就是它的代表

3064
01:51:28,433 --> 01:51:30,000
这是一种不同的视角

3065
01:51:31,533 --> 01:51:32,500
它的维度性

3066
01:51:32,533 --> 01:51:33,200
就是这样的

3067
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:38,233
我认为在迷幻体验中发生的是 意识可以沿着那个结构上下移动

3068
01:51:38,766 --> 01:51:42,600
就是这样的 也许不仅仅是上下移动 也许还能穿越它

3069
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:45,500
我知道这是一个激进的说法

3070
01:51:45,533 --> 01:51:47,833
这是一个非常激进的说法 它可能是错误的

3071
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:52,933
但它可能是错误的 因为大多数激进的说法都是错误的 但是

3072
01:51:54,633 --> 01:52:02,100
但我不太确定它是错误的

3073
01:52:04,866 --> 01:52:05,633
这里有些很酷的东西

3074
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:10,466
所以那是斯堪的纳维亚世界树 是一位拜访亚马孙使用死藤水的部落的人类学家绘制的

3075
01:52:11,666 --> 01:52:15,533
由一位访问使用死藤水的亚马孙部落的人类学家绘制

3076
01:52:21,333 --> 01:52:23,533
现在你看到它是一条蛇

3077
01:52:23,533 --> 01:52:24,266
它是一棵有蛇的树

3078
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:35,533
这让人想起亚当和夏娃的故事 显然 但它也让人想起我们的灵长类动物的栖息地 对吧 因为那基本上是我们的祖先家园——一棵树

3079
01:52:36,566 --> 01:52:40,500
它被蛇包围 而蛇喜欢吃我们 这是很久以前的事了

3080
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,600
这大概是500亿年前

3081
01:52:44,166 --> 01:52:49,966
真的是很久以前的事了 所以我们不确切知道这些图像从何而来

3082
01:52:50,533 --> 01:52:59,833
但我确实怀疑我们用我们发展出来用来侦测蛇的电路来代表未知本身

3083
01:52:59,933 --> 01:53:08,666
因为像蛇是从未知中出现的东西 就像我们进化一样 我们都是从一个动物结构进化而来的

3084
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:14,566
所以我们必须从某处获得我们的生物学认知结构 而且

3085
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,166
我们有思考绝对未知和其中的恐怖 涉及到的恐惧

3086
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:26,433
我们不理解的事情可以从中涌现出来的恐怖 完全合乎情理地 我们会使用已经预先发展好的电路

3087
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:29,566
这是对世界存在结构的合理代表

3088
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:42,533
我想我以前可能给你们展示过这个 但它总是让我感到惊奇 这个图片

3089
01:53:42,733 --> 01:53:49,700
所以我儿子在他九岁的时候画的 所以右边你可以看到蘑菇房子 而且

3090
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:56,666
它们上面有他所有朋友的名字 所以那是秩序 然后在左边

3091
01:53:57,300 --> 01:54:03,066
你可以看到那里的混乱 那个小橙色的东西是个虫子 然后中间有条河

3092
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:09,733
就像阴阳符号 中间有分隔 这非常酷 然后就是它了

3093
01:54:09,766 --> 01:54:10,533
那是雅各的梯子

3094
01:54:11,666 --> 01:54:16,400
就像杰克和豆茎 顺便说一下 这也是同一个萨满故事的另一个变种 而且

3095
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:23,033
有虫子在上下爬 它们从天堂带来消息 然后在天堂上面

3096
01:54:24,033 --> 01:54:28,400
有太阳 还有圣彼得 我不知道他从哪里得到这些

3097
01:54:28,633 --> 01:54:30,733
他并没有接受很多宗教教育

3098
01:54:30,766 --> 01:54:32,466
我的意思是 真的 尽管是我

3099
01:54:34,433 --> 01:54:35,966
天堂的大门在上面

3100
01:54:36,066 --> 01:54:39,766
然后那是他所认为的世界 他有一个非常有序的心理

3101
01:54:40,033 --> 01:54:48,433
我会说 而且还是有的 但当他画这个的时候 它真的让我震惊了 所以我把它做成了塑封 放在我的办公室里 因为

3102
01:54:49,733 --> 01:54:52,233
嗯 我不知道 因为那你怎么解释那个呢

3103
01:54:52,266 --> 01:54:53,566
那就是原因

3104
01:54:54,766 --> 01:54:54,900
所以

3105
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:08,200
嗯 你差不多明白了

3106
01:55:08,233 --> 01:55:10,733
欧洲的伟大教堂是

3107
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:18,200
它们就像是用石头建造的森林 试图表现阳光透过树叶的样子

3108
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:20,766
所以它有点像我们祖先的森林家园

3109
01:55:20,966 --> 01:55:24,333
但它被转化成了这些伟大的石雕

3110
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:29,600
而且 它们因为光和暗、颜色的结合而产生敬畏

3111
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:38,666
但我也认为出于同样的原因 巨大的树在人们心中产生敬畏 我们不想让它们被砍倒 它们在某种意义上看起来是神圣的 也许它们就是

3112
01:55:39,666 --> 01:55:53,000
但 这也是我的直觉 这些伟大教堂的建筑师们试图传达 他们试图表达一些深层和结构性的东西

3113
01:55:53,066 --> 01:56:05,033
他们试图表达这样一个观点：如果存在被适当构建 那么它将从亚原子级别一直到最高的宇宙级别完美地组织起来

3114
01:56:05,633 --> 01:56:09,000
所以每一层都堆叠在彼此之上 没有任何矛盾

3115
01:56:09,066 --> 01:56:15,000
那将是一种理想的存在模式 一切都将在这种情况下汇聚在一起

3116
01:56:15,066 --> 01:56:17,733
这就是这些教堂所表达的

3117
01:56:17,866 --> 01:56:20,933
这并不是所有它们所表达的 因为它们也呈十字形

3118
01:56:21,066 --> 01:56:29,300
而且 观点是 十字架的中心 也就是苦难的中心 也是个体的地方 是变革发生的地方

3119
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:31,333
这也构建在建筑中

3120
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:41,566
然后 就是构成我们的类树结构

3121
01:56:43,733 --> 01:57:04,233
它延伸到最微小的现实 微观宇宙 这个想法都以相同的方式表现出来 尤其是右上角的曼陀罗

3122
01:57:04,366 --> 01:57:12,600
就是这种完美的晶体结构的观念 这就是瑜伽士在整理他们的身体时试图达到的 他们试图

3123
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:25,333
让他们的每一个存在的层次都正确对齐 这有点像你可以在我认为是藏族沙画中看到的那个回音 如果我没记错的话 就在左下角

3124
01:57:26,166 --> 01:57:37,333
这个想法是 如果你正确地排列自己 那么信息就可以沿着那个代表你的树流动 没有任何阻碍 就是这样

3125
01:57:37,333 --> 01:57:40,000
那将是一种最佳健康状态

3126
01:57:40,033 --> 01:57:44,566
身体和精神的锻炼都可以使你处于那种状态

3127
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:49,700
那是 嗯 这些都是围绕着通往天堂的梯子这个想法的思想云团

3128
01:57:51,966 --> 01:57:58,400
于是雅各对上帝说 上帝说 看哪 我与你同在 我会保护你

3129
01:57:58,533 --> 01:58:04,700
在你所去的所有地方 并且会把你带回这片土地 因为我不会离开你直到我完成了我对你所说的

3130
01:58:05,333 --> 01:58:11,600
雅各从睡梦中醒来 他说 确实主在这个地方 而我却不知道

3131
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,033
他感到害怕并说 这个地方何其可怕！

3132
01:58:14,966 --> 01:58:17,900
这不是别的 正是上帝的家 这是天堂的门

3133
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:25,466
雅各一大早起来 拿起他作枕头的石头 立为柱子 并在其顶上倒油

3134
01:58:25,966 --> 01:58:26,733
那是一种牺牲

3135
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:32,000
他将那地方的名字叫做伯特利 但那城市起初被称为路斯

3136
01:58:32,566 --> 01:58:36,700
雅各许愿说 如果上帝与我同在 并在这条道路上保佑我

3137
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:44,333
我所走的路 给我食物吃和衣服穿 以致我平安返回我父亲的家 那么主将是我的上帝

3138
01:58:45,033 --> 01:58:47,766
我所立为柱子的这块石头将是上帝的家

3139
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:52,933
凡赐给我的 我必定将十分之一献给你

3140
01:58:55,033 --> 01:58:56,766
这是一个很好的停止点

3141
01:58:58,533 --> 01:58:59,733
那么 现在 我就...

3142
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:03,200
...总结一下

3143
01:59:03,233 --> 01:59:07,200
所以 你看到这个道德上模棱两可的角色 对吧

3144
01:59:07,366 --> 01:59:12,300
到目前为止 我们所知道的 他所做的几乎全都不好

3145
01:59:13,066 --> 01:59:18,733
所以他非常可怕地背叛了他的兄弟两次 严重到他的兄弟想杀了他 而且

3146
01:59:19,566 --> 01:59:21,433
每个人都能在某种程度上同情他的兄弟

3147
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:30,400
所以然后他基本上是因为他母亲告诉他就逃跑了 这并不确切地证明他的品格 尽管如此

3148
01:59:31,766 --> 01:59:37,566
奇怪的是他有了这样的经历 那是振奋人心的

3149
01:59:37,566 --> 01:59:39,533
我想那就是重点 那就是

3150
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:44,500
人们天生倾向于犯下可怕的错误

3151
01:59:44,833 --> 01:59:46,000
对此毫无疑问

3152
01:59:46,733 --> 01:59:52,266
而且 当我在写我的最新书时 我有一个朋友

3153
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:55,266
诺曼·杜伊奇写了前言

3154
01:59:55,966 --> 01:59:58,900
诺曼写过几本很棒的书 他是犹太人

3155
01:59:59,733 --> 02:00:06,366
他读了我写的一些东西 并批评我 使得旧约中的上帝

3156
02:00:06,566 --> 02:00:10,200
从基督教的角度来看 太过严厉和不宽恕

3157
02:00:10,233 --> 02:00:16,200
因为他的批评和我在做这些讲座中学到的东西 我重写了相当一部分

3158
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:18,600
就像 这并不完全正确

3159
02:00:18,633 --> 02:00:23,366
我的意思是 旧约中发生的事情是如果你犯错了 特别是如果你知道自己犯错了

3160
02:00:23,700 --> 02:00:29,900
而你决定不去做任何事情 所以这是有意识的和蓄意的 那么 看着吧 地狱在等着你

3161
02:00:29,933 --> 02:00:31,233
你将面临严重的麻烦

3162
02:00:31,266 --> 02:00:34,600
而且我实际上认为这也在心理上是准确的

3163
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:39,666
荣格指出的一点 这总是让我印象深刻 是如果你不知道你在做什么

3164
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:46,433
这实际上也出现在托马斯福音中 有趣的是作为其中一个歌特福音 基督告诉他的追随者类似于

3165
02:00:47,300 --> 02:00:50,633
如果你犯了错误 而且你不知道你在做什么 那么你将会被原谅

3166
02:00:51,300 --> 02:01:03,600
但如果你在做什么并且还是这么做了 那么祝你好运 我认为这是心理上准确的 我的意思是

3167
02:01:03,633 --> 02:01:16,066
我的意思是 关于旧约中的审判性上帝非常有趣的一点是 可以与他讨价还价

3168
02:01:16,566 --> 02:01:27,500
即使你犯了错误 特别是如果你对它们一无所知 如果你还没有学到 比方说 你总是有机会回到正确的道路上

3169
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:34,366
这一点人们会变得愤世嫉俗 因为有这种大多是基督教的观念 你可以过着极其罪恶的生活

3170
02:01:34,566 --> 02:01:39,866
但如果你在临终前悔改 就像天堂等着你一样 这听起来像是一个很好的交易 对吧

3171
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:45,233
就像你可以做任何你想做的事情 直到你快死的时候 当然你可能不知道那是什么时候

3172
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:47,700
所以那是个问题 然后你只能说好吧

3173
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:48,233
我很抱歉

3174
02:01:48,433 --> 02:01:54,200
而且 一切都被原谅了 但对这种事情持愤世嫉俗态度的问题是 悔改不是小事

3175
02:01:55,733 --> 02:02:04,500
因为悔改意味着要搞清楚你实际上做了什么 你做的最坏的事情 搞清楚它们有多可怕

3176
02:02:05,133 --> 02:02:11,733
这可不是开玩笑的 而且没有对你的堕落深度的理解就没有真正的悔改 所以

3177
02:02:13,433 --> 02:02:17,500
如果你过着特别可鄙的生活 并且你开始理解它

3178
02:02:17,833 --> 02:02:27,200
我认为 仅仅是这个认识本身就可能会杀了你 醒来看到你所做的事情是多么可怕 如果你所做的真的很可怕的话

3179
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:30,866
所以没有简单的出路

3180
02:02:30,866 --> 02:02:32,000
这不是一个简单的出路

3181
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:36,166
把这个观念与简单的出路联系起来纯属愤世嫉俗

3182
02:02:36,166 --> 02:02:36,466
这不是

3183
02:02:37,166 --> 02:02:45,466
但有一个积极的观点不断被提出 那就是个体是道德选择的源泉

3184
02:02:46,233 --> 02:02:54,100
个体容易在可信和现实的方式下犯真正的错误和面对诱惑

3185
02:02:54,833 --> 02:03:01,200
这并不会切断个体与神圣之间的关系 以及进一步成长的可能性

3186
02:03:01,833 --> 02:03:02,633
然后我会说 好吧

3187
02:03:02,700 --> 02:03:13,300
感谢上帝 因为没有这点 像谁会有机会呢 谁会有机会呢 所以神明提出的无限

3188
02:03:13,433 --> 02:03:23,333
比如说在旧约中呈现的 仅仅是审判性的 这绝对是错误的 而且实际上是你可以与之争辩和讨价还价的东西 我将以一件事结束

3189
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:29,366
我在经历这过程中学到的东西之一是以色列这个名字的意义

3190
02:03:29,733 --> 02:03:35,133
因为雅各最终被命名为以色列 我有点提前到下一讲了 但是

3191
02:03:36,133 --> 02:03:45,300
以色列 所以他也是以色列的父亲 是构成以色列十二支派的十二个儿子的父亲 但以色列的意思是与上帝搏斗的人

3192
02:03:46,566 --> 02:03:50,333
这是一个非常有趣的观念 因为它再次是一个心理学的观念

3193
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:57,800
这就是为什么我之前说 在旧约中相信上帝的意义并不明显 因为雅各所做的就是与上帝搏斗

3194
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:07,633
我认为这是伦理生活的一个非常好的描述 因为如果你试图过一种伦理生活 那你所做的就是在挣扎

3195
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:13,233
盲目的信仰并不有帮助 因为你不知道你在相信什么 就是不那么有帮助

3196
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:24,833
但如果你渴望正确定位自己 但也对世界的存在结构（我们都是如此）感到困惑

3197
02:04:24,966 --> 02:04:28,666
那么你正在做的就是在伦理上挣扎

3198
02:04:29,866 --> 02:04:31,433
雅各实际上受了相当重的伤

3199
02:04:31,533 --> 02:04:35,366
他字面上与上帝摔跤 上帝使他的大腿脱臼

3200
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:39,966
所以 那里的想法是 小心点 对吧

3201
02:04:40,033 --> 02:04:44,866
你所抗衡的东西虽然强大 但你可以与之抗衡

3202
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,233
这就是让人感兴趣的地方

3203
02:04:46,633 --> 02:04:50,500
但 这样做确实存在一些真正的风险 我认为这完全正确

3204
02:04:50,933 --> 02:04:52,000
但以色列的观念…

3205
02:04:52,266 --> 02:04:56,300
所以有以色列国 可以说 和以色列的应许之地 以及所有这些

3206
02:04:56,433 --> 02:05:07,300
但有一个更重要的观念 这又是一个心理学的观念 那就是以色列的状态 即应许之地的状态 是每一个与上帝搏斗的人所处的状态

3207
02:05:08,533 --> 02:05:16,900
这并不是对于永恒祝福后生活的幼稚的快乐信仰

3208
02:05:17,033 --> 02:05:17,700
不是那样

3209
02:05:18,066 --> 02:05:19,133
这不是一种愿望的满足

3210
02:05:20,433 --> 02:05:25,166
这是积极参与生活 参与生活的困难 对吗

3211
02:05:25,566 --> 02:05:31,400
并试图找到道路 因为这就是与上帝搏斗的意义 就是试图找到道路

3212
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:38,166
在我看来 这似乎是旧约中信仰的基本含义 也许新约亦是如此

3213
02:05:38,833 --> 02:05:45,366
信仰是通过试图找到道路来表达的 这是一场伦理斗争 也是一场真实的斗争

3214
02:05:45,433 --> 02:05:53,200
这是生命的斗争 只要你愿意参与这场斗争 那么从理论上讲 你就有神的支持

3215
02:05:53,233 --> 02:06:05,033
所以我相信 我认为这是真的 因为我看到的另一件事是 那些将事情设置正确的人 以便

3216
02:06:05,033 --> 02:06:12,166
宇宙毁灭的可怕力量不会毁灭我们

3217
02:06:12,233 --> 02:06:15,333
那些试图纠正事情的人是那些在道德伦理上挣扎的人

3218
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:19,900
所以 那有一种救赎的元素在其中

3219
02:06:19,900 --> 02:06:23,400
我不认为有任何方式可以对此持愤世嫉俗的态度

3220
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:26,733
所以 好吧 所以谢谢你

3221
02:06:26,766 --> 02:07:02,833
所以记得要对着麦克风说话 因为还有很多其他的在观看的人将会听到我们的声音 所以好的 嗨 彼得森博士

3222
02:07:02,866 --> 02:07:05,866
关于今天的雅各故事 有一个背叛的主题

3223
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:09,333
从一开始就可以看到 因为他对他的兄弟感到非常愤怒和嫉妒

3224
02:07:09,366 --> 02:07:13,100
我在想是否有任何关于背叛的故事或看法

3225
02:07:13,233 --> 02:07:23,400
是来自于所爱之人的 对吗 不是那种非黑即白的愤怒、怨恨和苦涩 这些人是如何从中恢复的

3226
02:07:23,633 --> 02:07:27,733
或者有没有其他方式来重新定义它 或者它就是像如果你背叛了某人那样的黑白分明吗

3227
02:07:27,933 --> 02:07:29,900
就像雅各那样 他是痛苦的

3228
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:32,966
他并不是由恨而驱动的 事实上 在这个故事中

3229
02:07:32,966 --> 02:07:36,900
这不是非黑即白的 因为我们知道我们只讲到了故事的一半

3230
02:07:38,666 --> 02:07:48,100
作为一名临床医生 可以这么说 作为人们的观察者 我从未见过任何人能逃脱他们所做的事情

3231
02:07:49,033 --> 02:07:51,633
雅各也没能逃脱这一切

3232
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:59,866
所以 他的最终经历使他变得谦卑 他意识到自己做错了

3233
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:03,400
在雅各的故事中发生了和解

3234
02:08:04,633 --> 02:08:12,300
有小的背叛和重大的背叛 有些带来了极大的严重后果 而有些后果较轻

3235
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:18,600
但有一个潜在的观念 即使情况复杂 事情仍可以被纠正

3236
02:08:19,633 --> 02:08:24,266
我认为雅各花了大约20年的时间 差不多 来纠正事情

3237
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:26,033
即便那样 情况还是岌岌可危的

3238
02:08:26,966 --> 02:08:29,300
那么 我回答了你的问题吗

3239
02:08:30,833 --> 02:08:30,933
好的

3240
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:31,133
是的

3241
02:08:32,366 --> 02:08:32,566
嘿

3242
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:39,866
您在讲座中经常谈到 我猜 是善与恶之间的战争 或者

3243
02:08:40,100 --> 02:08:46,566
生命的真正斗争 是意识存在的核心是善与恶的斗争

3244
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:56,566
那么在这个前提下 如果您百分之百确定没有来生

3245
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:02,133
您是否会仍然能宣称生命中有积极的意义吗

3246
02:09:03,200 --> 02:09:08,700
如果您百分之百确定 某些无神论者似乎是百分之百确定的 但他们仍然宣称

3247
02:09:08,833 --> 02:09:11,600
生命中有一些积极的意义 您会成为那样的人吗

3248
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:14,933
或者您会变成该隐 变得如此愤世嫉俗吗

3249
02:09:16,033 --> 02:09:22,733
我认为 至少对我来说 从研究20世纪历史中我学到的一件事是

3250
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:28,866
即使是最为愤世嫉俗的观点 比如

3251
02:09:29,633 --> 02:09:33,466
生活就是无可救药的苦难 甚至因此而无法自证其正当性

3252
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:40,033
我仍然认为你有一种道德义务 可以说

3253
02:09:40,833 --> 02:09:45,333
以某种方式生活 以减少这种苦难 尽可能地减少

3254
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:52,800
因此 我认为 这种生活方式在某种意义上可以被视为有意义的 独立于超验的背景之外

3255
02:09:53,566 --> 02:09:56,833
现在 我不完全知道如何去除超验的背景

3256
02:09:57,133 --> 02:09:59,866
因为我会说发生在我身上的一件事是

3257
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:03,800
因为我花了很多时间关注人们所做的可怕事情

3258
02:10:03,900 --> 02:10:07,466
就像荣格说的 这是他的一个著名引言

3259
02:10:08,233 --> 02:10:12,700
他说 没有哪棵树能够接触到天堂 除非它的根扎到了地狱

3260
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:28,566
因此 随着我更深入地挖掘人类的堕落 我对人类可能性的感知也以相应的比例增长

3261
02:10:28,733 --> 02:10:34,533
直到我实际上确信善良是一种比邪恶更有力的力量 尽管邪恶是一种难以置信的强大力量

3262
02:10:35,333 --> 02:10:37,700
因此 现在我无法真正剥离掉那种超验

3263
02:10:38,533 --> 02:10:45,500
考虑到它对永恒的影响 比如对来世的影响 我的意思是 我无法对此说什么

3264
02:10:46,166 --> 02:10:55,966
我唯一能说的是 关于存在的许多事情我们一无所知 我们不了解意识的本质或时间的本质

3265
02:10:57,033 --> 02:11:06,700
所以我不会因此而绝望 但是 是的 我认为生活可以在没有来世的必要性下仍然充满意义

3266
02:11:07,300 --> 02:11:10,633
你能在一次讲座中不使用“超验”这个词吗

3267
02:11:10,733 --> 02:11:10,900
不 不行

3268
02:11:11,266 --> 02:11:11,366
不

3269
02:11:17,566 --> 02:11:18,233
你好 彼得森博士

3270
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:20,633
自从研究了您的作品以来 我发现最吸引人的一点是

3271
02:11:20,733 --> 02:11:26,500
您对该隐和亚伯故事的分析

3272
02:11:27,366 --> 02:11:32,566
我的问题是 如果该隐在杀死他的兄弟、毁灭他的理想之前到达了那个点

3273
02:11:34,566 --> 02:11:43,700
并决定那是他不想做的事情

3274
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:49,166
您会给到达那个点的人什么建议或指导

3275
02:11:53,800 --> 02:12:00,533
有一个故事我读过叫《鸡尾酒会》

3276
02:12:00,933 --> 02:12:05,800
我之前提到过 由T.S.艾略特写的 而在《鸡尾酒会》中有一个场景 是一出戏剧

3277
02:12:06,533 --> 02:12:11,666
一个女人走近一个精神病医生并开始向他谈论她的问题

3278
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:14,366
她说了一些令他惊讶的话 她说

3279
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:16,633
我希望问题出在我身上

3280
02:12:17,233 --> 02:12:18,666
他问 你为什么会希望是这样呢

3281
02:12:19,200 --> 02:12:23,533
她说 我想了很多 如果世界是问题所在 那我就无能为力了

3282
02:12:23,666 --> 02:12:29,566
因为我无法改变世界 但如果我是问题所在 那或许我可以改变自己的一些东西

3283
02:12:29,900 --> 02:12:35,333
我可以解开我所处的这种可怕情境 所以我会说这就是悔改

3284
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:46,100
从根本上来说 就是如果 我要小心地说这个 因为我知道人们容易遭受不幸

3285
02:12:48,866 --> 02:12:55,633
罪恶和无知会让情况变得更糟 但除此之外 好人也会遭受苦难 毫无疑问

3286
02:12:56,800 --> 02:13:08,400
但如果事情对你来说不对劲 如果你因为存在而怀有怨恨 那是正确的方式 因为这是思考它的最深刻的方式

3287
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:11,733
如果你阅读那些进行大规模杀戮的人的文章

3288
02:13:12,133 --> 02:13:13,466
你会一次又一次地看到这一点

3289
02:13:13,466 --> 02:13:14,000
这是该隐

3290
02:13:14,033 --> 02:13:23,700
就像他们对存在的无法忍受感到无比愤怒 他们对上帝感到愤怒 即使他们没有明确这么说

3291
02:13:23,933 --> 02:13:27,900
他们几乎就是这么说的 差别无异

3292
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:34,600
上帝对该隐说的是 先审视自己再批评存在

3293
02:13:37,033 --> 02:13:39,633
这在我看来是正确的

3294
02:13:39,666 --> 02:13:43,966
因为不这么做是难以置信的傲慢 那是撒旦式的傲慢

3295
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:47,400
如果这样的事情可以是字面意义的话

3296
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:51,166
就像在你整理你的

3297
02:13:51,200 --> 02:13:52,466
哦 你的房间 比如说之前 不要使自己成为存在的裁判

3298
02:13:56,833 --> 02:14:02,366
因为另一件事情也是 这是我从索尔仁尼琴那里学到的一部分 当他在劳改营里

3299
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:09,233
试图理解他所见到的那些英雄般的人如何可能做到这一点 他进行的一个练习

3300
02:14:09,633 --> 02:14:16,566
他真的是在基督教东正教的悔改和救赎背景下看待这个问题 他说他用梳子细致地检查了自己的一生

3301
02:14:18,433 --> 02:14:25,566
试图想象他一生中所犯的所有道德错误 他知道这些是错误 对吧

3302
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:33,400
这是一次灵魂的探索 他不依赖外部的道德标准 除了在不可避免受到这些影响的情况下

3303
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:40,266
然后他的想法是 现在我能做些什么来纠正这个错误

3304
02:14:40,266 --> 02:14:43,266
那是正确的问题 就像如果事情不按你的方式发展 而且

3305
02:14:44,133 --> 02:14:47,900
我认为这意味着你怀有怨恨、傲慢和欺骗

3306
02:14:47,933 --> 02:14:49,566
这三件事是紧密相连的

3307
02:14:49,933 --> 02:14:56,800
我认为那构成了某种意义上邪恶的核心 因此如果你被那些充斥着地狱般的存在占据

3308
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,466
那么就是悔改

3309
02:14:59,633 --> 02:15:03,466
正确的答案就是你必须弄清楚你做错了什么

3310
02:15:04,433 --> 02:15:10,200
你必须为此付出代价 至少你可以想 好吧 我可以全心全意地尝试这样做

3311
02:15:10,733 --> 02:15:12,300
可以说 看看会发生什么

3312
02:15:13,400 --> 02:15:13,666
对吧

3313
02:15:13,666 --> 02:15:16,966
它至少可以是一次实验 然后我也会说 那是一种信仰的行为

3314
02:15:17,433 --> 02:15:21,666
进行那次实验是一种信仰的行为 因为你把自己置于风险之中 对吧

3315
02:15:22,033 --> 02:15:23,433
那就是信仰的行为

3316
02:15:23,466 --> 02:15:24,266
你不知道结果

3317
02:15:24,633 --> 02:15:26,600
但你也不知道你生活的结果

3318
02:15:26,633 --> 02:15:28,500
所以在某种意义上生活就是一种信仰的行为

3319
02:15:29,133 --> 02:15:30,800
你在某些事情上寄予信仰

3320
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:32,333
这就是为什么你会向前行

3321
02:15:32,333 --> 02:15:34,300
没有信仰的行为你就无法前进

3322
02:15:35,500 --> 02:15:38,666
人们说 好吧 我只根据事实向前行

3323
02:15:38,833 --> 02:15:43,700
就像 是的 但你选择事实 而事实有无穷无尽 它们并不直接告诉你该做什么

3324
02:15:43,900 --> 02:15:45,433
所以这不是一个可信的答案

3325
02:15:46,666 --> 02:15:48,533
所以如果你处于那种情况 就像

3326
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:51,666
审视自己

3327
02:15:52,666 --> 02:15:56,600
索尔仁尼琴最了不起的一点是他就是这么做的

3328
02:15:56,600 --> 02:16:05,666
然后他写了《古拉格群岛》 他用斧头砍向了极权共产主义国家的知识和道德基础

3329
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:11,566
所以当他在拯救自己的同时 可以说他也在拯救世界

3330
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:15,966
你看到像这样的事情 你得清醒过来 伙计

3331
02:16:15,966 --> 02:16:16,200
那真的很了不起

3332
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:18,866
所以

3333
02:16:19,733 --> 02:16:19,866
是的

3334
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:29,433
是的 彼得森博士

3335
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:38,733
我有很多问题源于您在贝尔福100活动中的发言、您的M103视频、您最近与艾扬·希尔西·阿里的讨论 以及您对伊斯兰教在西方的一般评论

3336
02:16:39,433 --> 02:16:42,833
在您的评论中有一个共同的主题 即这些事情之间有所不同

3337
02:16:43,366 --> 02:16:46,866
您把犹太-基督教传统放在一边 而伊斯兰教放在另一边

3338
02:16:47,900 --> 02:16:52,566
具体来说 就是“伊斯兰教的复杂问题”和作为一个“全面体系”的引述

3339
02:16:53,500 --> 02:17:01,866
在我继续之前 请允许我声明 如果假设对伊斯兰教的最终分析结果和您对后现代主义或新马克思主义的彻底谴责一样

3340
02:17:02,433 --> 02:17:03,800
我个人一点也不会感到冒犯

3341
02:17:03,833 --> 02:17:05,900
这不是个人问题

3342
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:11,866
在您最近与艾扬·希尔西·阿里的采访中 她说西方价值观优于伊斯兰法和伊斯兰价值观

3343
02:17:12,933 --> 02:17:16,866
基本上 我同意这一点 当然是在当前全球事务的背景下

3344
02:17:17,566 --> 02:17:19,866
我将跳过她在《理性》杂志采访中的引用 但你应该阅读它们

3345
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:23,866
因为她的世界观非常强调西方对抗伊斯兰教

3346
02:17:24,633 --> 02:17:27,866
不是激进的伊斯兰教 而是包括军事选项在内的伊斯兰教

3347
02:17:28,966 --> 02:17:32,866
所以我的问题是 在这些故事的心理意义层面 在神话和原型的层面上

3348
02:17:33,066 --> 02:17:36,533
伊斯兰教与犹太-基督教传统有何不同

3349
02:17:37,033 --> 02:17:42,300
因为亚当、夏娃、撒旦 等等 从堕落到洪水的所有事情

3350
02:17:43,866 --> 02:17:47,000
你在这个系列讲座中讨论的很多内容同样也是伊斯兰教的一部分

3351
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:51,500
实际上 我认为对伊斯兰教最强烈的批评是它可能相当缺乏原创性

3352
02:17:52,466 --> 02:17:57,800
今晚你说过 一个文化的道德前提是通过其故事体现出来的

3353
02:17:58,200 --> 02:17:59,566
我看到很多相同的故事

3354
02:18:00,033 --> 02:18:01,166
所以 撇开当前全球事务不谈

3355
02:18:01,233 --> 02:18:05,933
我在问的是 在最深层次上 这些故事和道德前提有多大不同

3356
02:18:06,833 --> 02:18:08,466
好吧 这是个关键的问题

3357
02:18:11,300 --> 02:18:11,466
好吧

3358
02:18:12,566 --> 02:18:16,666
首先我要说的是 从根本上来说 我不知道

3359
02:18:18,066 --> 02:18:24,100
因此 我计划做的一件事之一就是进行一系列的讨论

3360
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:38,433
很多人已经联系我讨论与艾扬·希尔西·阿里的对话 如你所知 她有着强大而严肃的敌人 他们对她的黑白划分不满意

3361
02:18:39,833 --> 02:18:43,600
因此 现在我读了《异教徒》 我真的很喜欢那本书

3362
02:18:44,633 --> 02:18:47,066
我的感觉是她是一个英雄

3363
02:18:48,200 --> 02:19:01,633
现在这意味着与伊斯兰教的关系是另一个故事 因为她来自一个极权主义的 可以说 家庭结构在一个相对极权主义的社会

3364
02:19:02,266 --> 02:19:06,466
你可以说这与伊斯兰教有一定的对应关系

3365
02:19:06,466 --> 02:19:09,933
你也可以说没有 当然这是关键问题

3366
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:20,066
因此 有几件事我无法轻易理解 与伊斯兰教有关

3367
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:25,966
其中之一是我所看到的教会与国家未能分离

3368
02:19:26,966 --> 02:19:28,933
这是一个问题

3369
02:19:30,866 --> 02:19:39,300
这可能本身不是问题 但它确实是伊斯兰教与西方关系中的一个问题 因为我们分离了教会与国家

3370
02:19:39,900 --> 02:19:45,766
在美国有基督教原教旨主义者认为这种分离是个错误

3371
02:19:46,866 --> 02:19:53,066
所以这不仅仅是伊斯兰教中的一个观点 认为它们应该是统一的

3372
02:19:54,133 --> 02:19:59,466
但这绝对是我们共存的一个问题 因为这是一个根本不同的假设

3373
02:20:00,266 --> 02:20:01,733
所以这是第一个问题

3374
02:20:03,100 --> 02:20:07,300
对我来说的第二个问题 再次这可能是因为我的无知

3375
02:20:07,433 --> 02:20:11,000
我正在尝试纠正 穆罕默德是一位军阀

3376
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:15,633
我不知道该如何处理这个事实

3377
02:20:17,166 --> 02:20:30,433
就像你可以说基督 假设的话 我不是在谈论历史现实 虽然我也不是否认 在他的所有身份中

3378
02:20:30,766 --> 02:20:33,200
军阀绝对不是其中之一

3379
02:20:34,766 --> 02:20:36,366
我不知道该怎么办

3380
02:20:38,433 --> 02:20:41,300
所以我不知道如何调和这一点

3381
02:20:42,133 --> 02:20:48,466
我不知道如何调和 不仅是穆罕默德是军阀

3382
02:20:48,700 --> 02:21:00,100
我不认为这是不合理的声明 他发起的扩张是难以置信的成功

3383
02:21:00,266 --> 02:21:04,633
我的意思是 600年内 它成为了世界上最大的帝国

3384
02:21:05,466 --> 02:21:10,433
它摧毁了拜占庭基督教 这是西方人甚至不了解的事情

3385
02:21:11,300 --> 02:21:21,333
我读过的思想家说 西方文化因为拜占庭基督教的摧毁而在文化上受到了如此巨大的创伤 以至于我们现在甚至无法研究它

3386
02:21:22,733 --> 02:21:27,066
所以我不知道这是否为真 但我也不确定它不是真的

3387
02:21:28,733 --> 02:21:36,866
阿富汗的佛教徒被消灭了 我们在塔利班摧毁那些伟大的佛教纪念物中看到了这一点的呼应

3388
02:21:37,566 --> 02:21:37,766
所以

3389
02:21:40,733 --> 02:21:51,566
所以我希望有一座桥 最好是有一座桥 这就是我想进行这些讨论的原因

3390
02:21:52,200 --> 02:22:01,666
因为我想了解是否存在一座桥 所以很多人已经给我推荐了他们认为比艾扬·希尔西·阿里更好地代表伊斯兰教的人

3391
02:22:02,433 --> 02:22:10,466
或许他们是正确的 希望我有机会与他们交谈 因为我想知道我所想的是否错误

3392
02:22:11,800 --> 02:22:14,266
因为如果它是错误的 重要的是我知道它是错误的

3393
02:22:15,566 --> 02:22:17,633
但在这一刻

3394
02:22:17,666 --> 02:22:28,366
我不知道它是错的 而且我不确定它意味着什么

3395
02:22:30,666 --> 02:22:36,566
所以我认为没有人能确定 因为我们有这种文明的交织

3396
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:44,533
还有其他的事情 比如我对沙特阿拉伯人和瓦哈比派不是很满意

3397
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:52,900
我不认为他们是盟友 我不明白任何西方女性怎么可能认为他们是盟友

3398
02:22:54,000 --> 02:23:00,666
我对我们发送给他们的石油美元在很大程度上被转化为

3399
02:23:02,266 --> 02:23:16,600
绝对是对西方的威胁的宣传感到不满 我对我们的政治家似乎愚蠢地对此视而不见感到不满 这可能再次是因为我的无知

3400
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:24,500
当然有可能 但这些是我无法调和的事情 所以

3401
02:23:29,566 --> 02:23:39,066
我也看到了我在这里提出的想法与其他宗教传统之间的相似之处 比如道教、佛教、印度教

3402
02:23:39,833 --> 02:23:43,166
对我来说 与伊斯兰教架起桥梁更难 我不确定为什么会这样

3403
02:23:44,066 --> 02:23:46,500
我认为这与我刚才提出的事情有关

3404
02:23:47,266 --> 02:23:53,500
现在 我对伊斯兰教不了解的东西可以填满很多卷书 其中很多现在就在我家的书架上

3405
02:23:53,866 --> 02:23:57,433
因为我想要在这个过程中进行阅读

3406
02:24:10,333 --> 02:24:11,633
晚上好 彼得森博士

3407
02:24:11,633 --> 02:24:13,300
感谢您继续进行这个系列

3408
02:24:14,133 --> 02:24:21,166
即使我们是无神论者 也欣赏这种互动和对话

3409
02:24:21,633 --> 02:24:33,700
我想问您一个既情感化又分析化的问题 因为通常您被认为是非常分析性地看待问题的

3410
02:24:34,366 --> 02:24:49,900
所以您之前谈到了快乐和荣誉之间的对立 尽管我个人不认为它们是互斥的

3411
02:24:49,966 --> 02:24:56,600
但如果有这样一种情况 假设 某人真正爱上了另一个人

3412
02:24:56,933 --> 02:25:00,666
他们相爱多年甚至几十年 共同拥有一段历史

3413
02:25:01,833 --> 02:25:09,333
然后这对伴侣中的一个人开始爱上了另一个人

3414
02:25:10,833 --> 02:25:27,333
所以 并不是对原始伴侣的爱减少了 当你感觉你想要保持荣誉并且感到快乐时 你如何在情感和分析上处理这样的情况

3415
02:25:28,700 --> 02:25:31,933
好吧 首先我想说的是魔鬼总是隐藏在细节中

3416
02:25:32,900 --> 02:25:40,433
对 所以我对许多现代道德理论不满意的一点是

3417
02:25:41,366 --> 02:25:46,566
它采取这样的故事 然后试图提取出一个普遍的道德原则

3418
02:25:46,766 --> 02:25:52,500
而这往往是不可能的 因为情况的具体细节非常重要

3419
02:25:53,466 --> 02:25:54,566
但话虽如此...

3420
02:25:55,766 --> 02:25:57,466
好吧 让我思考一会儿

3421
02:25:58,900 --> 02:26:06,033
我不确定在这种情况下是否可能保持荣誉 因为我认为你的行为实际上已经“违规”了

3422
02:26:07,133 --> 02:26:13,100
而且 违规之后 承认它 --可能是正确的事情 虽然也可能不是--

3423
02:26:14,133 --> 02:26:14,866
因为如果你...

3424
02:26:15,733 --> 02:26:19,966
我并不认为如果你背叛了某人 那么你就有权利告诉他们

3425
02:26:20,400 --> 02:26:21,133
我不是这个意思

3426
02:26:21,300 --> 02:26:23,500
我知道 我知道你不是 我明白的

3427
02:26:23,633 --> 02:26:24,600
我不是 我不明白

3428
02:26:24,633 --> 02:26:26,866
是的 是的 我理解 我理解

3429
02:26:31,033 --> 02:26:41,066
我的观察是 如果有一段紧密的关系 如果一方以那种方式背叛了另一方 那几乎总是无法和解的

3430
02:26:41,633 --> 02:26:42,233
它打破了这段关系

3431
02:26:43,633 --> 02:26:47,400
而且 我帮助人们尝试挣扎度过这一点

3432
02:26:47,900 --> 02:26:51,766
无论是被背叛的人还是背叛者

3433
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:58,200
我见过人们成长并且不再重犯 这发生在他们的伴侣不知道的情况下

3434
02:26:59,033 --> 02:27:06,466
在其中一些情况下 对于行为人来说 这似乎甚至可能是一次必要的学习经历

3435
02:27:06,966 --> 02:27:09,666
这帮助他们成长

3436
02:27:09,666 --> 02:27:14,233
这并不意味着我在为此辩解 但生活是复杂的

3437
02:27:14,800 --> 02:27:25,300
但我认为考虑到一切 当你做出承诺并坚持它时 社会运作得更好

3438
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:30,133
而且 我从读荣格的书中学到的一件事 我真的很喜欢 那就是

3439
02:27:32,233 --> 02:27:33,400
他相信

3440
02:27:34,700 --> 02:27:38,600
他也有过婚外情 所以你可能会认为这有些虚伪 但

3441
02:27:40,366 --> 02:27:44,966
但我认为人们可以犯错误 而不必然意味着他们的想法是错误的

3442
02:27:46,033 --> 02:27:50,366
他说在婚姻中有些东西你除非全心全意 否则无法拥有

3443
02:27:51,700 --> 02:27:53,433
我相信这一点 我确实相信

3444
02:27:54,166 --> 02:27:59,133
所以如果一开始就有一个后门打开 或者后来出现了一个后门

3445
02:27:59,266 --> 02:28:05,566
那么我认为这段关系至少缺少了某些东西 而且我认为你会为此付出很大的代价

3446
02:28:06,900 --> 02:28:15,133
所以我的意思是 这取决于你是否将婚姻视为一种实用安排还是精神安排 实际上它是两者都有

3447
02:28:15,133 --> 02:28:16,666
两者都很重要

3448
02:28:18,033 --> 02:28:28,000
但如果它是一种精神安排或心理安排为主 那么我确实认为 如果不全心投入 你就无法得到转变

3449
02:28:28,433 --> 02:28:47,600
如果你违背了它 即使你能与你的伴侣解决问题 你也永远无法得到某些东西作为后果 好的 最后一个问题

3450
02:28:47,666 --> 02:28:52,266
我希望我会提一个好问题 也感谢您继续这个系列讲座

3451
02:28:52,366 --> 02:29:00,433
我还没听完所有的讲座 但看起来您非常专注于圣经故事对个人心理的吸引力

3452
02:29:01,066 --> 02:29:07,700
您对群体心理学相对于圣经的吸引力和持久力有什么看法吗

3453
02:29:08,700 --> 02:29:15,766
还有为什么圣经或圣经故事会优先于其他可能取代它的意识形态

3454
02:29:17,100 --> 02:29:25,700
好吧 让我们先从第二个问题开始

3455
02:29:25,733 --> 02:29:32,766
我认为这和当某人同时创作和编辑一部伟大电影时发生的事情一样

3456
02:29:35,033 --> 02:29:39,000
没人知道一部伟大电影中有多少选择

3457
02:29:39,100 --> 02:29:44,066
比如说是一部动画电影 因为动画电影中的一切都是构建出来的 一切

3458
02:29:44,766 --> 02:29:48,933
只有上帝知道有多少选择 可能有数百万个选择

3459
02:29:49,933 --> 02:29:58,533
每个选择都是由某种叙事适宜性或美的直觉引导的

3460
02:29:59,133 --> 02:30:02,300
或者有一些更高的理想激发它正确的创作杰作的愿望

3461
02:30:02,500 --> 02:30:13,433
也许就是这样 例如迪士尼电影肯定是这样 因此那种渴望决定了决策 所以我会说

3462
02:30:14,733 --> 02:30:20,800
类似的事情指导了圣经正典中故事的写作和选择

3463
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:24,633
那么 可能有其他的故事包含在内吗

3464
02:30:24,733 --> 02:30:29,633
嗯 天主教徒和新教徒没有相同的圣经传统 犹太人和基督徒也不一样

3465
02:30:29,733 --> 02:30:33,733
因此 这并不完全清楚 对吗

3466
02:30:34,033 --> 02:30:39,066
我的意思是 这在某种意义上类似于我们刚才关于伊斯兰教和基督教的讨论

3467
02:30:42,733 --> 02:30:49,233
在某种意义上 我已经把那个具体问题搁置了 除了我刚刚回答的部分

3468
02:30:49,300 --> 02:30:56,233
因为我正在尝试理解我们所拥有的 这是我知道根植于我们文化的东西 以及我们拥有的是什么

3469
02:30:57,400 --> 02:31:06,933
为什么我们会拥有它 嗯 我尝试按照我刚才描述的方式来解释这个问题 但我并没有最终答案

3470
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:08,600
它可能会有所不同吗

3471
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,466
在某些层面上可能会有所不同 但在其他层面上则相同

3472
02:31:15,400 --> 02:31:25,233
我的意思是 那些没有被后现代主义致命影响的比较宗教学者 例如荣格

3473
02:31:25,333 --> 02:31:30,133
以及伊利亚德 以及那些对宏大叙事感兴趣的人们

3474
02:31:30,300 --> 02:31:40,100
他们非常清楚地指出 许多文化中存在一套共通的神话主题 我试图在《意义的地图》中概述这一点 这对我来说相当成功

3475
02:31:40,233 --> 02:31:44,800
至少对我来说是这样 因为一旦我勾勒出了基本的原型结构

3476
02:31:44,933 --> 02:31:48,466
就为我打开了来自各种不同文化的各种故事的大门

3477
02:31:49,133 --> 02:31:54,066
这是难以置信的有用 比如美索不达米亚的《安努玛·埃利什》故事

3478
02:31:54,600 --> 02:32:03,066
当我弄明白它对我意味着什么 就像我从未忘记过它一样 它深深烙印在我的记忆中 埃及的故事也是如此

3479
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:08,866
我读过的一些佛教著作以及一些道家教义也非常有力

3480
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:13,466
所以我认为事物在一个层面上可以是不同的 在另一个层面上是相同的

3481
02:32:13,900 --> 02:32:25,800
但人类在相当长的时间内会在相同之处汇聚在一起 因为人类作为个体和作为群体一起生活的方式并不多

3482
02:32:26,933 --> 02:32:31,666
因此 有一个持续的力量使我们的道德前提趋于一致

3483
02:32:32,233 --> 02:32:35,433
然后这就自然地在故事中得到表达

3484
02:32:35,466 --> 02:32:36,766
现在就是这样的

3485
02:32:36,800 --> 02:32:38,900
这是一个不完美的过程 充满了错误

3486
02:32:39,933 --> 02:32:40,066
所以

3487
02:32:42,533 --> 02:32:52,000
是的 所以只有一个通知

3488
02:32:52,666 --> 02:32:54,800
好吧 两个通知 下一次讲座

3489
02:32:54,833 --> 02:32:55,766
我相信是11月14日

3490
02:32:56,300 --> 02:32:59,366
所以我希望能完成雅各的故事

3491
02:33:00,066 --> 02:33:05,200
然后我还将与Gad Saad和Oran Amity一起出现在11月11日的一个小组讨论上

3492
02:33:05,800 --> 02:33:09,533
那里还有不少票在售

3493
02:33:09,766 --> 02:33:13,766
所以如果你感兴趣 可以去我的网站购买门票

3494
02:33:13,800 --> 02:33:15,300
应该会很不错

3495
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:16,433
希望会很有趣

3496
02:33:16,500 --> 02:33:18,766
我觉得会的 可能会太有趣了

3497
02:33:19,933 --> 02:33:21,033
那是一种可能性

3498
02:33:22,266 --> 02:33:25,633
所以我们会看看 但我今年还要做两次这样的讲座

3499
02:33:26,266 --> 02:33:28,600
我希望我能讲完约瑟夫的故事

3500
02:33:28,700 --> 02:33:31,266
然后我可以在新年开始讲《出埃及记》

3501
02:33:31,466 --> 02:33:36,900
那是一个我很熟悉的故事 《出埃及记》、《利未记》 还有那个之后的是什么

3502
02:33:38,333 --> 02:33:39,066
是的 谢谢你

3503
02:33:40,066 --> 02:33:43,900
所以我非常期待 因为那真是一个很棒的故事 所以

3504
02:33:44,466 --> 02:33:47,266
而且我也准备了一些惊喜 所以

3505
02:33:47,933 --> 02:33:52,100
无论如何 非常感谢你们的到来 希望我们11月14日再见
