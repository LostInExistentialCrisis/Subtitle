1
00:00:17,188 --> 00:00:31,299
Alright, so the last time I was here, many of you were as well, we got halfway through the story of Jacob, and I've been digging underneath the story sporadically since then

2
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:38,123
to try to find out what other themes are being developed, and I've got some things that I think are really interesting to talk about.

3
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:40,340
So we'll get right into it.

4
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,860
So I'm going to review a little bit first

5
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:56,940
so we were talking about Jacob and I'll re-update his Biography a little bit so that we can place ourselves in the proper context before we go on

6
00:00:57,921 --> 00:01:04,618
So his mother Rebecca gave birth to twins and the twins even in her womb were struggling for well

7
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,380
They were struggling and of course the story is that they were struggling for dominance the older

8
00:01:10,244 --> 00:01:14,200
or the younger against the older really because Jacob Jacob means usurper and

9
00:01:15,183 --> 00:01:21,100
Rebecca had a What would you call a vision from God that said that

10
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:35,491
Jacob would supplant Esau and so even before her twins were born they were in a state of competition and that's a recapitulation of the Motif of the hostile brothers, right?

11
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:43,891
It's a very very very common mythological motif and we we already saw that really well developed in the story of Cain and Abel right

12
00:01:43,915 --> 00:01:51,115
and Cain and Abel were essentially the first two human beings the first two natural born human beings and they were instantly locked in a state of enmity

13
00:01:51,139 --> 00:02:03,939
which is symbolic of first the enmity that exists within people's psyche between the part of them you might say that's aiming at the light

14
00:02:03,963 --> 00:02:08,863
and the part of them that's aiming at the darkness and I think that's a reasonable way of portraying it.

15
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:16,660
Obviously, it's a way that's sort of rife with symbolism, but my experience of people,

16
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:27,580
especially when you get to know them seriously or when they're dealing with serious issues, is that there is quite clearly a part of them that's striving to do well in the world or even to do good,

17
00:02:27,604 --> 00:02:34,604
and another part that's deeply cynical and embittered that it says to hell with it and is self-destructive and

18
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:38,680
lashes out and really aims at making things worse and

19
00:02:41,303 --> 00:02:44,200
so that seems to be a natural part of the human psyche and

20
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:51,240
That's also reflected in the the idea of the fall and so those ideas are not easily cast away

21
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:58,520
They're associated with the rise of self-consciousness right in in the story of the Garden of Eden, and I think that's right because I

22
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:03,820
I do think that our self-consciousness produces that division within us because

23
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:14,260
more than any other creature we're Intensely aware of our finitude and suffering and that tends to turn us at least to some degree against being itself

24
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:22,940
You know I was watching A bunch of protesters in the US last week scream at the sky

25
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:25,619
ha about Trump you know and

26
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:31,500
And it was interesting like I thought it was an extraordinarily narcissistic display

27
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:36,895
But but despite that there's something symbolically appropriate about it.

28
00:03:36,895 --> 00:03:42,215
I also there's a movie I really like sadly enough called FUBAR.

29
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:43,500
I don't know how many of you have seen that

30
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:56,145
Yeah, you know that movie I take it yeah, it's about the people I grew up with so yeah, that's true man I'm telling you that's true.

31
00:03:56,145 --> 00:04:01,700
So the the guy the main actor in FUBAR who's quite bright, but completely uncivilized

32
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:09,916
Gets testicular cancer, and there's one great scene where he gets far too drunk, and he's stumbling around the street You know in you know

33
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:20,500
Virtually comatose state and of course he's not very thrilled with what's happened to him, and he's shaking his fist at the sky It's pouring rain, and he's cursing God, and you know it's like well

34
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:27,340
You can kind of understand his position so that kind of reminded me of these people who were yelling at the sky You know

35
00:04:27,364 --> 00:04:36,064
they were basically they're are dramatizing the idea of in rate They were enraged at well you could say God of course most of them wouldn't say that but

36
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,220
But they were the ones yelling at the damn sky

37
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:44,200
I mean you know so you got a you got a look at what they're doing rather than what they say and they were outraged

38
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:49,920
That being was constructed such that Trump could have arisen as president and so

39
00:04:51,221 --> 00:05:02,119
Well, so this idea, you know, that we could be easily turned against being and work for its destruction is a really, it's a really common, common, common theme, it never goes away.

40
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:11,500
You see it echoed in stories like with the new Marvel series, for example, you see the enmity between Thor and Loki, that's a good example of the same thing.

41
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:23,779
or between Batman and the Joker there's there's or Superman and Lex Luthor these there's these pairs of hero against villain that's a really dramatic and easily

42
00:05:24,943 --> 00:05:27,600
What everyone can understand that dynamic, right?

43
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:37,740
It's a basic plot and the reason it's a basic plot is because it's true of the battle within our spirits our own Individual spirits it's true within families

44
00:05:37,764 --> 00:05:41,264
because sibling rivalry can be unbelievably brutal

45
00:05:41,284 --> 00:05:49,878
It's true between human beings who are strangers It's true between groups of people like it's true at every level of analysis, and then in some sense.

46
00:05:49,878 --> 00:05:52,251
It's it's archetypally true

47
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:59,440
At least with regards to deep religious symbolism because you see that echoed in many stories as well

48
00:05:59,464 --> 00:06:06,564
So I think the clearest representation is probably Christ and Satan that's the closest to a pure archetype although

49
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:15,140
There is in the old Egyptian stories There's Osiris and Seth or Horus and Seth and Seth is a precursor to Satan

50
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:29,097
Etymologically, so it's a very very common motif and so that's what happens again in Rebecca's womb is that this thing this idea is played out right away and the two Two twins are actually

51
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:31,033
What would you call it there?

52
00:06:32,545 --> 00:06:35,778
they have a superordinate destiny because

53
00:06:37,244 --> 00:06:44,359
One of them is destined to become the father of Israel, and of course, that's a pinnacle moment in the Old Testament,

54
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:49,167
obviously, and arguably a pinnacle moment in human history.

55
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:56,920
Now, you know, the degree to which the stories in the Old Testament actually constitute what we would consider empirical history is a matter of debate.

56
00:06:57,681 --> 00:07:10,512
But it doesn't matter in some sense because, as I mentioned, I think, before in this lecture series, You know, there are forms of fiction that are meta-true,

57
00:07:10,536 --> 00:07:18,436
which means that they're not necessarily about a specific individual, although I generally think they are based on the life of specific individuals.

58
00:07:18,512 --> 00:07:20,900
It's the simplest theory, but who knows, right?

59
00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:31,000
But they're more real than reality itself, because they abstract out the most relevant elements of reality and present them to you.

60
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:35,960
And that's why you watch fiction that you know you don't you want you want your fiction boiled down, right?

61
00:07:36,785 --> 00:07:38,280
You want to boil down to the essence

62
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,620
That's what makes good fiction and that essence is something that's truer than than plain old truth

63
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:58,820
If it's handled well, and so you know if you watch a shakespeare play half a lifetime of events can go by in a shakespeare play and it covers a wide range of scenes and so on and and

64
00:08:00,085 --> 00:08:11,160
And so it's it's cut and edited and compressed all at once But because of that it blasts you with with a kind of emotional and ethical force that just the mere

65
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,340
Videotaping of someone's daily life, you know wouldn't even wouldn't even come close to approximating

66
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:18,490
so

67
00:08:19,502 --> 00:08:21,390
And this motif of the hostile brothers.

68
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:27,437
That's a that's a deep deep archetypal truth and

69
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:40,548
God says to Rachel, two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels, and one people shall be stronger than the other, and the elder shall serve the younger.

70
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:56,024
And so there's an inversion there, because as we've discussed, historically speaking and traditionally speaking, it's the elder son to whom the disproportionate blessings flow.

71
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:13,200
some truth in that too even more what would you say more empirically IQ tends to decrease as the number of children in the family increase the younger the oldest is the smartest generally speaking

72
00:09:13,224 --> 00:09:26,124
it isn't clear why that is but it might be that they get more attention but who knows so those of you who are younger can be very unhappy about that fact now Jacob okay so there's another

73
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:37,736
there's another plot line here too because Abraham and and Rebecca Are at odds

74
00:09:38,582 --> 00:09:46,716
It's sorry Isaac and Rebecca are at odds about the children right, so there's a there's an oedipal twist to it too because

75
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:57,400
Well Isaac is allied with Esau who turns out to be the hunter type, so he's your basic rough-and-tumble character, you know, and he's kind of a wild-looking guy.

76
00:09:58,241 --> 00:10:00,189
Hairy, and he likes to be outside.

77
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:00,992
He lives in tents.

78
00:10:00,992 --> 00:10:01,735
He likes to hunt.

79
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:02,880
He's a man's man.

80
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,706
That's one way of thinking about it.

81
00:10:04,706 --> 00:10:06,793
Whereas Jacob dwells in tents.

82
00:10:06,793 --> 00:10:08,138
You know, he doesn't go outside much.

83
00:10:08,138 --> 00:10:08,539
He's more...

84
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:12,177
Well, maybe he's more introverted, but he's certainly this sort of kid,

85
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:18,600
adolescents say, who hangs around home, and there's some intimation that he's his mother...

86
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:25,120
Well, he's clearly his mother's favorite and with all the advantages and I suppose disadvantages that go along with that and

87
00:10:26,722 --> 00:10:43,053
Isaac and Rebecca don't see eye-to-eye about who should have predominance among the sons and Rebecca is quite complicit with Jacob in Inverting the social order so the first thing that happens.

88
00:10:43,053 --> 00:10:51,520
That's crooked is that Esau comes in from hunting and he's you know maybe he's been out for a number of days and

89
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,520
he's ravenous and he's kind of an impulsive guy doesn't really seem to think about the long-term very much and

90
00:10:58,822 --> 00:11:00,799
Jacob was cooking some lentil stew and

91
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:10,836
Esau wants some of it and Jacob refuses and and then says that he'll trade his his birthright for it and

92
00:11:13,502 --> 00:11:16,917
Esau agrees, which is a bad deal, right?

93
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:17,720
It's a bad deal

94
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:23,520
And so you you could say that Esau actually deserves what's coming to him although

95
00:11:26,382 --> 00:11:29,894
At minimum you'd have to think of them both as being equally culpable.

96
00:11:29,894 --> 00:11:34,017
It's a nasty trick and so that's Jacob's first trick and

97
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:43,279
then the second trick is that it's later and Isaac is old and blind and

98
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:45,415
you know close to death and

99
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:49,479
And it's time for him to bestow a blessing on his sons.

100
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:53,079
Which is a very important event, apparently, among these ancient people.

101
00:11:55,741 --> 00:12:01,639
And Esau, again, is out hunting, and Rachel dresses Jacob up in a hairy...

102
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:08,879
Puts a goatskin on his arm, so he's kind of hairy like Esau, and dresses him in Esau's clothes, so he smells like Esau, and...

103
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:19,659
Isaac tells Esau to go out and hunt him up some venison, I think it is, which is a favorite of his.

104
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:28,739
And Rebecca has Jacob cook up a couple of goat kids and serve that to Isaac and play the role of Esau.

105
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,506
And so he does that.

106
00:12:30,506 --> 00:12:33,458
It's pretty damn nasty, really, all things considered.

107
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,918
you know, to play a trick like that, both on your brother and on your blind father, and in collusion with your mother.

108
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:45,299
It's not the sort of thing that's really designed to promote a lot of familial harmony.

109
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:53,818
And so, especially because you've already screwed him over in a big way once, you know, you'd think, you'd think that would be sufficient.

110
00:12:54,602 --> 00:13:03,560
So, anyways, he's successful, and Esau loses his father's blessing, and so that Jacob ends up really in the position of the firstborn.

111
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:09,780
And it's quite interesting because you know God tells Rachel that Jacob is going to be the dominant twin

112
00:13:09,804 --> 00:13:16,604
And you'd think again with God's blessing or at least the prophecy that Jacob would end up being in a good guy

113
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:22,739
But he's certainly not presented that way to begin with which is also quite interesting given that he's the eventual founder of Israel

114
00:13:23,421 --> 00:13:34,374
And it's another indication of the realism of these old stories you know and it's quite amazing to me It's always been quite amazing to me how unpredified these stories have remained.

115
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:35,840
You know, because you'd think that

116
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:47,080
if you're even the least bit cynical, especially if you had the kind of Marxist religion-is-the-opiate-of-the-masses kind of viewpoint, which is a credible viewpoint, you know, although it's wrong,

117
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:59,719
but it's, well, I think it's a shallow interpretation, and a part of the reason I think it's a shallow interpretation is because the stories would be a lot prettier if that was the case.

118
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:06,439
These These characters wouldn't have this strange, realistic, moral ambiguity about them.

119
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:15,437
You know, if you're going to feed people a fantasy, then you want it to be like a Harlequin novel or a greeting card or something like that.

120
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,237
You don't want it to be a story that's full of betrayal and deceit and murder and mayhem and genocide and all of that.

121
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,825
That just doesn't seem all that, what would you say, calming, I guess would be the right answer.

122
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:37,678
So anyways, Jacob gets away with this, but Esau is not happy, and Jacob is quite convinced that he might kill him.

123
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:45,018
And I think that was a reasonable fear, because Esau was a tough guy, and he was used to being outside, and he knew how to hunt, and he knew how to kill,

124
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:52,942
and he actually wasn't very happy about getting seriously screwed over by his, you know, stay-at-home younger brother twice.

125
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,378
And so Jacob runs off, and goes to visit his uncle.

126
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,358
And on the way, and this is a very interesting part of the story, he stops to sleep, and

127
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:09,339
he takes a stone for a pillow, and then he has this vision, it's called a dream, but

128
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:19,716
the context makes it look like a vision, of a ladder reaching up to heaven, and with angels moving up and down the ladder, let's say.

129
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:27,220
And there's some representations of that, I showed you some of them the last time we met, but I'll read it to you first.

130
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:04,040
Thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and now shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and To the north and the south so that lays out the canonical directions right

131
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:10,664
so now There's a center with the canonical directions like the thing that you see you know that little symbol you see on maps

132
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:22,831
It's the same thing that symbolically placed upon the earth so a center has been established with radiating Directional lines radiating from it.

133
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:26,018
So it establishes it as a place.

134
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:30,160
And in the end I see shall all the families of the earth be blessed.

135
00:16:30,204 --> 00:16:31,800
So that's pretty good news for Jacob.

136
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,960
And it's not self-evident why God is rewarding him for running away after screwing over his brother.

137
00:16:37,141 --> 00:16:39,374
But that seems to be what happens.

138
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:43,360
And so here's a couple of representations, classic representations.

139
00:16:44,723 --> 00:16:46,333
The one on the right is William Blake.

140
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,500
It's one I particularly like.

141
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:54,718
You know, and Blake assimilates God with the sun and with light, right?

142
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:02,404
So that's quite a common mythological idea, that God is associated with light and the day.

143
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:12,636
And behold, I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land.

144
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,658
For I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.

145
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:25,680
And Jacob awake out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not and he was afraid which is exactly the right response

146
00:17:25,704 --> 00:17:36,004
and said how dreadful is this place it is none other than the house of God and this is the gate of heaven and Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows

147
00:17:36,028 --> 00:17:44,828
and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it and that's that's a more important thing than you think and we'll go into that a little bit more deeply because

148
00:17:44,852 --> 00:17:52,352
up to this point in the story there isn't anything really there isn't anything that's really emerged to mark a sacred space right

149
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:56,076
there's no there's no Cathedral there's no church there's nothing like that

150
00:17:56,076 --> 00:18:04,076
but here's this idea that emerges that you can mark the center of something that and that's important and you mark it with a stone

151
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:12,660
and stone is a good way to mark things that that are important because the stone is permanent right and we mark things with stones now like we mark graves with stones for example

152
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:18,984
because we want to make a memory and to carve something into stone to carve a stone and then to carve something into stone

153
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:27,320
is to make a memory and to use stone is to make a memory because stone is permanent and to set it up right is to indicate a center

154
00:18:27,344 --> 00:18:37,444
and so that's what happens and pours oil on the top of it which is a kind of offering and he called the name of that place Bethel but the name of the city was called Luz at the first

155
00:18:37,468 --> 00:18:55,495
and Jacob vowed a vow saying if God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on then a tenth of what I earn I will give him.

156
00:18:55,495 --> 00:18:57,759
I missed that.

157
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,514
That's interesting, too, because now there's a transformation of sacrifice, right?

158
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:06,416
Because until that point, sacrifices had been pretty concretized.

159
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,122
It was the burning of something.

160
00:19:08,122 --> 00:19:18,378
Whereas here, all of a sudden, it's the offering of productive labor per se, like a tithe, because a tithe is a form of sacrifice.

161
00:19:18,378 --> 00:19:20,809
And so there's an abstraction of the idea of sacrifice.

162
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:33,137
Now, sacrifice, it's really important that the idea of sacrifice gets abstracted, right, because it should be abstracted to the point where it's used the way that we use it today, which is,

163
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:44,765
we make sacrifices to get ahead, and everyone understands what that means, but the sacrifices are generally some combination of psychological and practical.

164
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:46,130
So we're not acting them out.

165
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,945
We're, precisely, we're not dramatizing them or ritualizing them.

166
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:54,086
We actually act them out in our, in the covenant that we make with the future.

167
00:19:54,086 --> 00:20:01,640
And we do that, well, unless we're extraordinarily impulsive and aimless in our lives, and have really no conception whatsoever of the future,

168
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:10,654
and are likely to sacrifice the future for the present, which is what Esau does, right, then we make sacrifices.

169
00:20:10,654 --> 00:20:17,920
And you got to think, like, the idea of making sacrifices to make the future better is an extraordinarily difficult lesson to learn

170
00:20:17,944 --> 00:20:26,944
it took people God only knows how long to learn that you know like we have no idea it's not something that animals do easily

171
00:20:26,968 --> 00:20:35,368
chimpanzees don't store leftover meat you know they just and neither do wolves they just a wolf can eat about 30 pounds of meat in one sitting

172
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:45,992
and that's that's where the idea of wolfing it down comes from they're not hiding it saving it for later you You know, they can't do that, so they can't sacrifice the present for the future.

173
00:20:46,082 --> 00:20:48,394
So this is a big deal that this happens.

174
00:20:49,600 --> 00:21:04,972
Now I want to tell you a little bit about the idea of the pillar, because it's an unbelievably deep idea, and it orients us in ways that we still don't understand.

175
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,595
In fact, it's actually the mechanism by which we're oriented.

176
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,376
And if it's lacking, then we become disoriented.

177
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,358
And so I'll show you some pictures and describe them first.

178
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:18,696
Okay, so first of all, there's a walled city.

179
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:23,978
So let me tell you that you could think about that as an archetypal human habitation.

180
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:30,117
Maybe it's a reflection of something like a fire in the middle of the plain or the forest,

181
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,833
or the jungle for that matter, although it's kind of hard to get a fire going there.

182
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,080
and a fire ringed around with logs and perhaps ringed around with dwellings, right?

183
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:47,346
So the fire's in the center, and the fire defines the center, and then as you move away from the fire, you move out into the darkness, right?

184
00:21:47,346 --> 00:21:57,520
So the fire is light and communion and safety, and as you move away from the fire, you move out into the darkness and what's terrifying out beyond the perimeter.

185
00:21:57,661 --> 00:21:59,709
So what's beyond the perimeter is terrifying.

186
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:02,239
You can feel that if you go camping somewhere that's wild.

187
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:05,139
you know, you're pretty damn happy, especially if the wolves are howling,

188
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:09,819
you're pretty damn happy to be sitting by the fire, because you can see there,

189
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:21,119
the fire keeps the animals away, and, you know, if you do wander into the bush, into the darkness, then you're on alert, and, you know, your predator detection systems are on alert.

190
00:22:21,561 --> 00:22:30,139
And so you could think about the classical human habitation as two places, one where your predator detection system isn't on alert,

191
00:22:30,621 --> 00:22:34,419
and another where your predator detection system is alert, on alert.

192
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:41,040
And you can think about that roughly as the distinction between explored territory and unexplored territory.

193
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:48,219
And really the founding of a place is precisely, this is a lot of this I got from reading Mircea Eliade,

194
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:57,099
the founding of a place is precisely the definition of an explored center set against the unexplored periphery.

195
00:22:57,701 --> 00:23:02,500
And, you know, what's interesting about that, so you can kind of think about that with regards to the walled city, right?

196
00:23:02,821 --> 00:23:08,319
Everything in the wall is cosmos, and everything outside the wall is chaos.

197
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:17,440
And, you know, but it also extends to the conceptual realm, because imagine that you're the master of a field of study.

198
00:23:18,141 --> 00:23:22,639
And so, that's an interesting metaphor, because a field is a geographical metaphor, right?

199
00:23:23,241 --> 00:23:32,259
And, if in the center of the field are those things that everyone knows really well, the axioms that everyone abides by in the field.

200
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:39,179
And then, as you move towards the fringes, you get towards the unknown, towards the frontier of the discipline.

201
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:43,259
And, as you become expert, you move from the center to the frontier.

202
00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:53,980
And so, then you're on the border, when you're a scholar, a competent scholar, you're on the border between the unexplored, Or the explored and unexplored.

203
00:23:54,384 --> 00:23:55,899
And you're trying to further that border.

204
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,495
So even if you're just doing this abstractly, it's the same thing.

205
00:24:00,242 --> 00:24:07,677
And it's a reflection of the fact that every human environment, concrete or abstract, it makes no difference,

206
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:15,273
recapitulates the cosmos-chaos dichotomy, or the order-chaos dichotomy.

207
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,455
And that's why in Taoism, for example,

208
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,300
it's the union of chaos and order that constitutes being itself and that you stand on the border between chaos and order

209
00:24:25,324 --> 00:24:35,924
because that's the proper place to be too orderly too much in the explored you're not learning anything too much out there where the predators lurk then you're frozen with terror

210
00:24:35,948 --> 00:24:40,937
and neither of those positions are desirable

211
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:50,961
and that's what you know and so you think and this is a concrete reality obviously as well as a psychological reality, there were reasons for those walls, right,

212
00:24:50,985 --> 00:24:54,885
because inside the walls were all the people like us.

213
00:24:54,937 --> 00:24:59,053
And so that begs the question, what does it mean for people to be like us?

214
00:24:59,053 --> 00:25:10,539
And then outside the wall there was all those people, because they were the worst forms of predators, because people are actually the worst forms of predators, who aren't like us.

215
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:16,280
And the wall is there to draw a distinction between like us and not like us and so

216
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:23,440
and that was a matter of life and death you can tell that because I mean look at those walls they had to build those by hand

217
00:25:23,464 --> 00:25:35,564
and you know you do see walled cities that have three rings of walls so these people were terrified but not so terrified as the people who built three walls they were really terrified and

218
00:25:35,564 --> 00:25:36,696
And they had their reasons.

219
00:25:37,664 --> 00:25:39,214
So, okay, so...

220
00:25:41,182 --> 00:25:49,739
Now, there's an idea that's reflected in the Jacob's Ladder story.

221
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:56,578
That the center, where you put the pillar, is also the place where heaven and earth touch.

222
00:25:57,684 --> 00:26:00,120
And so that's a complicated idea.

223
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:05,760
I think that you can you know I'm trying to look at these stories from a psychological perspective

224
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:11,560
and so then you could say that that's a symbolic place where the lowest and the highest come together and

225
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,978
so it's a place where

226
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:21,860
earthly being stretches up to the highest possible ethical abstraction, and that's the center because

227
00:26:23,142 --> 00:26:32,150
One of the things that defines us say as opposed to them is that we're all united within a certain ethic.

228
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,757
That's what makes us the same.

229
00:26:34,757 --> 00:26:42,857
This is a complicated line of reasoning and but I'll go back to it after I show you some more pictures

230
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:50,081
but so that's that's the first idea is that the center is the place where the lowest and the highest touch simultaneously

231
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:55,005
and so you could say that in some sense it specifies the aim of a group of people.

232
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:55,995
That's another way.

233
00:26:55,995 --> 00:27:02,895
You know if you get together with people to make a group even at work you group yourself around a project

234
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:10,219
and that unites you and it unites you because you all have the same aim you're all pointing to the same thing and that makes you the same in some ways because

235
00:27:10,243 --> 00:27:15,743
if you're after the same thing I am then the same things are going to be important to you that are important to me

236
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:22,867
and the same things are going to be negative to you that are negative to me because our emotions work out that way and that means I can instantly predict you

237
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:29,567
I know how you're going to behave and so our aim which is basically our ethical aim it's because we're aiming at something better at least in principle we're aiming at something better

238
00:27:29,591 --> 00:27:37,291
it's our ethical aim that unites our perceptions and that's what aligns our emotions

239
00:27:37,315 --> 00:27:44,415
and so that sort of begs the question if you're going to build a community around what aim should the community congregate

240
00:27:44,415 --> 00:27:53,015
okay so the idea here is that the center of the community is the pillar that unites heaven and earth so it unites the lowest with the highest so there's some

241
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:57,660
Intimation of the idea that it's the highest that unites the community

242
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,559
okay, and so keep that in mind and

243
00:28:01,744 --> 00:28:03,259
That's a very old idea as well

244
00:28:03,802 --> 00:28:07,960
That's the idea of the axis mundi which is the center pole that unites heaven and earth

245
00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:13,440
It's an unbelievably old idea tens of thousands of years old it might even stretch back to

246
00:28:23,024 --> 00:28:32,560
excessively old ancestry and trees when the tree itself was in fact the center of the world and that it was ringed by snakes and chaos

247
00:28:32,584 --> 00:28:40,184
and so well we have no idea how old these ideas are but they're very very old and evolution is a conservative business

248
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:47,308
once it builds a gadget then it builds new things on top of that gadgets like a medieval town right

249
00:28:47,308 --> 00:29:00,308
the center of the town is really old and new newer areas of the town get built around it but the center is still really old and that's what we're like you know our platforms like our our

250
00:29:00,362 --> 00:29:11,440
basic physiological structure this this skeletal body is some tens of millions of years older or older than that if you think about vertebrates it's much older than that

251
00:29:11,464 --> 00:29:17,564
and that's all conserved so everything's built on top of everything

252
00:29:17,644 --> 00:29:20,240
All right, so there there's a kind of a classic town

253
00:29:21,942 --> 00:29:26,940
And there's the idea I showed you this is scandinavian world tree same idea it unites heaven and Earth and

254
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:37,720
Around the roots of that tree are snakes that eat this tree constantly, so that's the idea that there's stability, but there's constant transformation around that stability and

255
00:29:39,004 --> 00:29:40,879
At the same time the snakes are gnawing on the roots.

256
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,135
There's There's streams that are nourishing it.

257
00:29:44,121 --> 00:29:53,438
So it's sort of an echo of the idea that life depends on death and renewal constantly, because your cells are dying and being renewed constantly, right?

258
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,438
If they are just proliferating, then you have cancer.

259
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,414
If they're just dying, then you die.

260
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:05,392
You have to get the balance between death and life exactly right, so that you can actually live, which is also a very strange thing.

261
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:13,454
And that tree is something that reaches from the bottom layers of being maybe the microcosm all the way to the macrocosm.

262
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,991
That's the idea anyways.

263
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:22,720
So then there's, okay, so there's Jacob and his pillar.

264
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:29,619
He's got this idea that you can mark the center with this stone, like it sort of symbolizes what he was laying on when he dreamt, but now he's got this idea.

265
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:37,479
You put something erect, and it marks the center, and it symbolizes his vision of the highest good something like that and

266
00:30:38,442 --> 00:30:44,660
The promise that's been made to him, and then this is an egyptian Obelisk the pyramid on top of it

267
00:30:45,901 --> 00:30:46,744
That's in Paris.

268
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:53,085
It was taken from Luxor and put in Paris, and so that's a much more sophisticated

269
00:30:55,621 --> 00:31:00,660
Instance of the same idea okay, and there was a stone age cultures across Eurasia

270
00:31:01,563 --> 00:31:06,500
That put up these huge obelisks everywhere these huge like the Stonehenge is a good example of that although

271
00:31:06,842 --> 00:31:10,360
It's it's very sophisticated, and they were also markers of places

272
00:31:10,921 --> 00:31:16,820
We don't know exactly what their function is but they're very much akin to this some permanent marker of place

273
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:31,280
There's a good one, so that's in St.. Peters, and I really like this one because you can see the echoes of Jacob's vision for the establishment of a territory there, right?

274
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,499
You've got the obelisk in the middle, and then you've got the directions radiating from the center.

275
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,826
And, of course, St. Peter's.

276
00:31:38,826 --> 00:31:43,980
This is the St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, which is an absolutely unbelievable place.

277
00:31:44,121 --> 00:31:45,636
It's just jaw-dropping.

278
00:31:46,582 --> 00:31:52,500
And, so there's the cathedral at the back of it, and then there's this circle of pillars that surrounds it.

279
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:56,739
You can just see them a little bit on the middle left there.

280
00:31:57,201 --> 00:32:03,379
That goes all the way around that entire enclosure, and, uh, you know, a very large number of people can gather there.

281
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:13,420
And then, so that pillar marks the center, and that would be the center of Catholicism, essentially, that's what that represents, right, the symbolic center of Catholicism.

282
00:32:14,282 --> 00:32:21,800
Although you could make the case that the cathedral is the center, it doesn't really matter, they're very close together, and it's half a dozen of one and six of the other.

283
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:30,259
And then, here's another representation of the same idea, right, is that this is why people don't like the flag to be burned, you know,

284
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:36,183
because conservative people see the flag as the sacred thing that binds people together.

285
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:42,319
And so, they're not happy when that sacred thing is destroyed, even if it's destroyed in the name of protest,

286
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:49,143
whereas the people who burn flags think, well, there are times to dramatize the idea that the center has been corrupt.

287
00:32:49,200 --> 00:33:01,060
And you can demonstrate that by putting it to the torch, you know, as a representation that the corrupt center now has to be burned and transformed.

288
00:33:01,781 --> 00:33:03,644
And the thing is, they're both right.

289
00:33:03,644 --> 00:33:12,780
They're both right all the time, because the center is absolutely necessary, and is sacred, and is almost always also corrupt, and in need of reparation.

290
00:33:13,062 --> 00:33:14,597
That's also an archetypal idea.

291
00:33:15,382 --> 00:33:20,500
And that's a useful thing to know because, you know, it's easy for young people in particular to think that

292
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:28,360
Well, the world's going to hell in a handbasket, and it's the fault of the last generation They've left us this terrible mess,

293
00:33:28,384 --> 00:33:36,085
and, you know, we're feeling pretty betrayed about that, and now we have to clean it up It's like, yeah, yeah, people have been thinking that for like 35,000 years.

294
00:33:36,085 --> 00:33:36,949
It's not new.

295
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:43,860
And the reason it's not new is because it's always true You know, what you're handed is a sacred center with flaws

296
00:33:44,603 --> 00:33:45,547
Always, always.

297
00:33:45,547 --> 00:33:48,318
And it's partly because it's the creation of the dead, right?

298
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,340
And the dead can't see, and they can't communicate, and so they're not in touch with the present.

299
00:33:53,842 --> 00:34:01,700
And so what they've bequeathed to you, apart from the fact that it might actually be corrupt, which is a slightly different thing, is at least blind and dead.

300
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,119
And so what the hell can you expect from something that's blind and dead?

301
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,500
You know, you're lucky if it just doesn't stomp you out of existence.

302
00:34:09,202 --> 00:34:14,520
So so that's a lovely photograph obviously, and that's the establishment of a new center

303
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:15,729
then

304
00:34:17,183 --> 00:34:21,660
The center can be a cathedral too and often is of course in in classic

305
00:34:22,682 --> 00:34:25,580
Towns European towns in particular although

306
00:34:26,604 --> 00:34:28,540
It's not only European towns that are like this there

307
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:32,320
There's a center that's made out of stone so that would be the cathedral

308
00:34:32,622 --> 00:34:42,240
And it's got the highest tower on on top of the tower There's often a cross and that's the symbolic center so people are are drawn together around whatever the cross

309
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,740
Represents now that the cross obviously represents a center because it's an x right x marks the spot

310
00:34:49,241 --> 00:34:55,700
So the center of the cross is the center and then the cathedrals often in a cross shape which also marks the center

311
00:34:56,162 --> 00:35:04,532
And then in the cathedral there's a dome often, and that's the sky and that's that ladder that reaches from earth to heaven.

312
00:35:04,532 --> 00:35:06,760
So it's a recapitulation of the same idea.

313
00:35:07,703 --> 00:35:21,027
So, and people are drawn to that center, and the center is the symbol of what unites them, and what unites them is the faith that the cathedral is the embodiment of.

314
00:35:21,027 --> 00:35:23,357
And you think, well, what does the faith mean?

315
00:35:23,357 --> 00:35:32,476
And again, we're approaching this psychologically, and what it means is that everyone who's member of that group accepts the transcendent ideal of the group.

316
00:35:32,476 --> 00:35:37,703
Now the thing is, if you're the member of a group, you accept the transcendent ideal of the group.

317
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:40,497
That's what it means to be a member of a group.

318
00:35:40,497 --> 00:35:49,459
So if you're in a work team and you're all working on a project, what you've essentially done is decided that you're going to make the goal unquestionable, right?

319
00:35:49,459 --> 00:35:57,080
I mean, you might argue about the details, but if you're tasked with something, you know, here's a job for you 10 people, organize yourself around the job,

320
00:35:57,104 --> 00:36:03,204
you can argue about how you're going to do the job but you can't argue about the job then the group falls apart

321
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:12,628
and so there's an act of faith in some sense the reason that the act of faith is necessary is because it's very very difficult to specify

322
00:36:12,641 --> 00:36:18,020
without error what that central aim should be given that there's any number of aims right

323
00:36:18,044 --> 00:36:26,860
and it's a very very difficult thing to figure out and this is something we're going to do a little bit tonight is like what should the aim be around which a group would congregate?

324
00:36:27,923 --> 00:36:30,460
You know that so so especially if it's a large group

325
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:36,600
And it's a large group that has to stay together across very large swaths of time and the group is

326
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,339
Incredibly diverse you know what possible kind of ideal could unite a

327
00:36:42,162 --> 00:36:45,500
Large group of diverse people across a very large stretch of time

328
00:36:45,983 --> 00:36:53,740
That's a really really hard question And I think part of the way that question has been answered is it's been answered symbolically Symbolically and in images

329
00:36:53,764 --> 00:36:58,964
because it's so damn complicated that it's almost impossible to articulate

330
00:36:59,001 --> 00:37:04,080
So but obviously you need to have a center around which everyone can unite because if you don't

331
00:37:04,642 --> 00:37:11,060
Then everyone's at odds with one another like if I don't know what you're up to and you don't know what he's up to We have no we're just strangers

332
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:22,360
And we don't know that our ethics match at all then the probability that we're going to be able to exist harmoniously decreases rapidly to zero and and that's obviously just no good

333
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:33,480
that's a state of total chaos so we can't have that it's it's not possible to exist without a central ideal it's not possible and it's deeper than that

334
00:37:33,801 --> 00:37:50,640
it's deeper than that partly because it's I don't I'll try to get this right this is the sort of thing that I was arguing with Sam Harris about you see your category system is a product of your aims

335
00:37:50,664 --> 00:38:02,064
that's the thing like if you have a set of facts at hand the facts don't tell you how to categorize the facts because there's too damn many facts there's a trillion facts and

336
00:38:02,082 --> 00:38:10,460
there's no way without imposing some a priority order on them of determining how it is that you should order them so how do you order them well that's easy

337
00:38:11,005 --> 00:38:12,820
You decide what you're aiming at

338
00:38:14,222 --> 00:38:15,308
Now how do you do that?

339
00:38:15,811 --> 00:38:17,500
I'm not answering that question at the moment

340
00:38:17,761 --> 00:38:21,579
I'm just saying that in order to organize those facts you need an aim and

341
00:38:22,622 --> 00:38:27,340
Then the aim instantly organizes the facts into those things relevant to the aim tools

342
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:33,660
Let's say those things that get in the way and a very large number of things that you don't have to pay attention to at all

343
00:38:34,684 --> 00:38:35,654
Right it excludes

344
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:38,935
Like if you're working on an engineering problem.

345
00:38:38,935 --> 00:38:39,760
You don't have to worry about

346
00:38:40,761 --> 00:38:45,320
Ah, ah, practising medicine in your neighbourhood.

347
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:53,500
You know, there's a bunch of, like if you're focusing on a particular, ah, what would you say?

348
00:38:55,941 --> 00:39:06,520
Any, any job, any set of skills implies that you're good at a small set of things, and then not good at an incredibly large number of other skills.

349
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:12,660
It simplifies things and so you can use your aim as the basis of a category structure

350
00:39:13,202 --> 00:39:19,123
and so you also have to keep that in mind because what it means is as far as I can tell that what it means is that

351
00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:26,500
Your category system itself, which is what structures your perceptions is actually dependent on the ethics of your aim

352
00:39:26,943 --> 00:39:28,152
It's directly.

353
00:39:28,152 --> 00:39:29,220
It's a moral thing

354
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:37,980
It's directly dependent on your aim, and that's a stunning idea if it happens to be true It's not how people think about thinking

355
00:39:38,004 --> 00:39:46,104
we don't think that way we like we think that we think deterministically Let's say or that we think empirically or that we think rationally

356
00:39:46,128 --> 00:39:55,728
and none of that appears to be the case what we do Is we posit a valid aim, and then we organize the world around the aim, and there's plenty of evidence from that in

357
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:02,211
psychological studies of perception right that that does look like how the the perceptual systems work.

358
00:40:02,211 --> 00:40:05,484
Mostly they ignore because the world's too complicated.

359
00:40:05,484 --> 00:40:11,205
They focus on a small set of phenomena deemed relevant to whatever the aim is.

360
00:40:11,205 --> 00:40:13,435
And then of course the aim is problematic.

361
00:40:13,435 --> 00:40:23,540
Again it's complex because the aim I have has to be an aim that some of you at share or at least don't object to because otherwise I'm not going to get anywhere with my damn aim.

362
00:40:23,942 --> 00:40:26,714
It has to actually be implementable in the world.

363
00:40:26,714 --> 00:40:38,620
It has to be sustainable across at least some amount of time it can't kill me like it's really hedged in this aim it's it isn't any old thing there's hardly any things that it can be

364
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:46,540
so you know Jacob's aim for example in undermining Esau almost gets him killed

365
00:40:47,224 --> 00:40:52,080
and you can understand why that's the other thing you think well that that was a nasty bit of work

366
00:40:52,104 --> 00:41:03,204
you can understand Esau's rage it's even though we're separated from the people in these stories by, what, 4,000 years, 3,000 years, something like that, you know immediately

367
00:41:03,281 --> 00:41:09,980
why everyone feels the way they do, at least once you understand the context of the story, that none of that's mysterious in the least.

368
00:41:11,264 --> 00:41:11,446
So...

369
00:41:13,283 --> 00:41:15,860
So there's the church, and the church is underneath the cross.

370
00:41:17,721 --> 00:41:18,624
Right, and so that's St.

371
00:41:18,624 --> 00:41:24,000
Peter's Basilica, and so there's the cross on the globe on top of the Basilica.

372
00:41:24,561 --> 00:41:28,819
And then there's the cross on the obelisk, as well.

373
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:34,900
And so, what that means is that, and this is where things get insanely complicated,

374
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:40,239
is that the center is defined by whatever the cross represents.

375
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:45,559
Now, the cross represents a crossing point geographically, it's certainly that.

376
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:48,699
The cross probably represents the body to some degree.

377
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:53,459
But then the cross also represents the place of suffering, obviously.

378
00:41:54,122 --> 00:41:58,779
And, more importantly, it represents the place of voluntary suffering transcended.

379
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:01,810
I'm speaking psychologically, right?

380
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,315
Not theologically.

381
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:04,299
That's what it represents.

382
00:42:04,961 --> 00:42:11,840
And so you might say, so here's the idea behind putting down the obelisk with the cross and saying that that's the center.

383
00:42:12,645 --> 00:42:14,359
So that's the thing that everyone's aiming at.

384
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:19,900
And so the idea would be, well, if you're going to be a member of the group defined by this obelisk,

385
00:42:19,924 --> 00:42:27,724
then what you do is accept your position at the center of suffering, voluntarily, and therefore transcend it.

386
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:29,145
That's the idea.

387
00:42:29,145 --> 00:42:31,492
And that is one hell of an idea.

388
00:42:31,492 --> 00:42:32,516
It really is, man.

389
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:33,839
That is a killer idea.

390
00:42:34,281 --> 00:42:38,859
Because it's actually a signal, it's a really clear signal of psychological health.

391
00:42:39,562 --> 00:42:44,239
You know, because one of the things you do if you're a clinical psychologist and someone is paralyzed by fear,

392
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:49,720
what you do is you break their fears down into relatively manageable bits and

393
00:42:50,322 --> 00:42:58,622
then you have them voluntarily confront their fears and it might also be things that they're disgusted by it say if they have obsessive-compulsive disorder

394
00:42:58,646 --> 00:43:07,546
but it produces very strong negative emotion whatever it is and then you have them voluntarily confront whatever it is that produces that overwhelming negative emotion

395
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:14,470
and that makes them stronger that's what happens it doesn't make them less afraid.

396
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:16,338
It makes them more courageous and stronger.

397
00:43:16,338 --> 00:43:17,624
And that is not the same thing.

398
00:43:17,624 --> 00:43:18,548
It's seriously not.

399
00:43:18,548 --> 00:43:20,637
It doesn't decrease the fear.

400
00:43:20,637 --> 00:43:22,906
It increases the courage.

401
00:43:22,906 --> 00:43:26,116
And so, that's a mind-boggling idea.

402
00:43:26,116 --> 00:43:26,779
And it's deeper.

403
00:43:26,779 --> 00:43:34,313
You know, one of the things that's really interesting about these archetypal ideas is that, and maybe it's partly because of the hyperlink nature of the Bible,

404
00:43:34,337 --> 00:43:40,337
that's part of it, but it's not the whole thing, is that no matter how deep you dig into them, you'll never get to the bottom.

405
00:43:40,413 --> 00:43:48,540
You know, you hit a bottom, you think, God that's so unbelievably profound and then if you excavate a little underneath that you find something else That's even more profound

406
00:43:48,564 --> 00:43:58,664
and you think wow that's got to be the bottom and then you dig under that It's like there's no bottom You can just keep digging down well as far as I can tell you can keep digging down layer after layer

407
00:43:58,704 --> 00:44:10,459
And we'll talk a little bit about more a little more about what the cross signifies as the center because you see what people were trying to figure out is is, what is it that we need to unite under?

408
00:44:10,902 --> 00:44:11,124
Right?

409
00:44:11,124 --> 00:44:13,080
What's the proper thing to unite under?

410
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:14,587
I can give you another example.

411
00:44:14,587 --> 00:44:16,778
So, in the Mesopotamian societies,

412
00:44:17,782 --> 00:44:22,939
the emperor, you know, who was more or less an absolute monarch,

413
00:44:23,482 --> 00:44:26,499
he lived inside what was essentially a walled city,

414
00:44:27,223 --> 00:44:30,539
and the god of the Mesopotamians was Marduk.

415
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:35,982
And Marduk was the figure who had eyes all the way around his head, and he spoke magic words. words.

416
00:44:35,982 --> 00:44:38,574
So it was very attentive and very articulate.

417
00:44:38,574 --> 00:44:45,720
And it was Marduk who went out and confronted the goddess of Chaos, the dragon of Chaos, and cut her into pieces and made up the world.

418
00:44:46,221 --> 00:44:48,507
Okay, so you can kind of understand what that means.

419
00:44:48,507 --> 00:45:00,080
So Marduk goes beyond the frontier into the place of predatory Chaos and encounters the thing that's terrifying and then makes something productive out of it.

420
00:45:00,582 --> 00:45:11,800
So it's a hero myth and and Marduk is elected to the position of preeminent God by all the other mesopotamian gods because he manages that so the the Marduk idea emerges up the holy

421
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:22,396
Dominance hierarchy and hits the pinnacle so that and God only knows how long that took it would be the amalgamation of many tribes and then that the

422
00:45:23,784 --> 00:45:30,600
what the The distillation of all the tribal myths to produce this emergent story of what Constitutes top God and then the job of the emperor was to act out Marduk

423
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,200
Constitutes top God and then the job of the emperor was to act out Marduk

424
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:42,700
That's what gave him sovereignty so the reason that he was the center around which people organized themselves wasn't because he was

425
00:45:43,481 --> 00:45:49,820
When he was being a proper emperor wasn't because there was something super special about him like the power didn't exactly reside in him

426
00:45:50,402 --> 00:45:57,567
Which is a really useful thing to separate right you want the power which is why it's kind of nice to have a The symbolic monarch.

427
00:45:57,567 --> 00:46:01,380
You get the symbolic power separated from the personality power, right?

428
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,930
Because otherwise they get conflated.

429
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,199
That's what happened in Rome.

430
00:46:04,822 --> 00:46:08,380
And you can see it tending to happen now and then in the U.S.

431
00:46:08,521 --> 00:46:10,715
Like with the Kennedy dynasties and that sort of thing.

432
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:16,898
So, the idea was the emperor had sovereignty as long as he was acting out Marduk properly.

433
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,360
And going out into the chaos and cutting it into pieces and making order.

434
00:46:21,848 --> 00:46:29,280
That was his job so they used to take him outside the city on the New Year's festival and strip him of all his emperor garments and

435
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:38,340
humiliate him and then force him to to Confess all the ways that year he hadn't been a good Marduk

436
00:46:39,321 --> 00:46:48,540
So he wasn't a good ruler and so that was supposed to clue him in and wake him up right and then they would ritually reenact the Battle of Marduk against

437
00:46:49,442 --> 00:46:52,610
Tiamat, the chaos monster, using statues.

438
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:58,830
And then, if that all went well, then the emperor would go back in and the city would be renewed for another year.

439
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:01,580
And we still have echoes of that in our New Year's celebration, right?

440
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:06,300
It's the same idea that's echoed down all those, all those centuries, thousands of years.

441
00:47:07,082 --> 00:47:10,033
So it's such a staggeringly brilliant idea, right?

442
00:47:10,033 --> 00:47:11,720
Because, so part of the idea is that

443
00:47:12,662 --> 00:47:17,340
the thing that's sovereign, so that's the pillar at the center that, that everyone gathers around, is

444
00:47:17,822 --> 00:47:21,899
is, at least in part, the thing that courageously goes out into the unknown

445
00:47:22,301 --> 00:47:25,379
and makes something useful out of it for the community.

446
00:47:26,446 --> 00:47:26,613
So...

447
00:47:29,501 --> 00:47:31,093
That's very, very smart.

448
00:47:31,093 --> 00:47:31,918
It's very smart.

449
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:35,488
So this is another example of a center.

450
00:47:35,488 --> 00:47:38,279
So this is the flag, this is the Union Jack, and so

451
00:47:39,183 --> 00:47:41,393
it's made up of a bunch of crosses, right?

452
00:47:41,393 --> 00:47:46,520
And so the first cross, the English cross, that's the flag of St. George, that's the flag of England.

453
00:47:46,801 --> 00:47:50,030
and what does St. George do?

454
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:51,494
Slays the dragon, exactly.

455
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:52,497
Same idea, right?

456
00:47:52,497 --> 00:47:58,744
So St. George, patron saint of England, goes out and slays the dragon and frees the virgin from the grip of the dragon.

457
00:47:58,744 --> 00:47:59,646
Same idea, right?

458
00:47:59,646 --> 00:48:00,990
So that's the center.

459
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:08,169
And then the second cross is called a celtier, but it's another crucifix.

460
00:48:08,169 --> 00:48:10,917
So it's the cross on which St. Andrew was crucified.

461
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,874
So it's the same idea.

462
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:19,179
The center is the center of suffering voluntarily undertaken, because Saint Andrew was a martyr.

463
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,877
And then Saint Patrick is the third cross.

464
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,789
What did Saint Patrick do in Ireland?

465
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,679
Chased out all the snakes, right?

466
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,656
So it's the same thing, right?

467
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:35,990
And so the flag of Great Britain is the combination of all of these three crosses that defines the center.

468
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,454
And that's what the flag is.

469
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,472
So that symbolizes all of that.

470
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,993
So that's, you know, completely mind-boggling.

471
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,959
So and there's more about Saint Patrick too.

472
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:53,259
So he banishes the snakes after a 40-day fast, and so that's an allusion to the 40 years

473
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:58,998
that Moses spends in the desert, and also the 40 days that Christ fasts in the New Testament.

474
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,496
And his walking stick, when he plants it, grows into a tree.

475
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,018
So that echoes all of the ideas about the center that we just described.

476
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:15,371
And he also speaks with the ancient Irish ancestors, which, if you remember, is a characteristic of the shamanic rituals.

477
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:28,396
So in the typical shamanic ritual, which seems to be elicited by psychedelic use, the shaman dissolve down past their bones,

478
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:34,220
and then they go up into heaven and speak with the ancestors, and then they're introduced into the heavenly kingdom,

479
00:49:34,244 --> 00:49:40,344
and then the flesh is put back on their bones, and they come back and tell everybody what happened.

480
00:49:40,396 --> 00:49:43,427
And that's a repeatable experience, right?

481
00:49:43,427 --> 00:49:46,998
The shamanic tradition is unbelievably widespread.

482
00:49:46,998 --> 00:49:53,742
So all over Europe, ancient Europe and Asia, and perhaps as far down as South America, right?

483
00:49:53,742 --> 00:50:00,926
It's highly conserved, and it's out of that tradition, in all likelihood, that our religious ideation emerged.

484
00:50:00,926 --> 00:50:02,850
So, and you can see echoes of that here.

485
00:50:07,241 --> 00:50:14,396
back to the story of Jacob and his ladder, so that I can come again to my father's house in peace, then shall the Lord be my God.

486
00:50:14,396 --> 00:50:21,411
And this stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house, and of all that that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.

487
00:50:21,411 --> 00:50:32,591
So that's also an echo, I would say, of the obligation of those who climb the power hierarchy to attend to those who are at the bottom, right?

488
00:50:32,591 --> 00:50:38,257
Because if you think about the tithing as a form of wealth distribution which is essentially what it is,

489
00:50:38,281 --> 00:50:51,381
part of the ethic that defines the proper moral endeavor that's related to that center is not to advance yourself at the expense of the entire community.

490
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:58,299
So if you're fortunate enough so that you can rise in authority and power and competence

491
00:50:58,661 --> 00:51:08,177
within the confines of a community, you still have an obligation to maintain the structure, maintain and further the structure of the community within which you rose.

492
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,796
And that's obvious, right?

493
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,910
Because if people didn't do that after a couple of generations, the whole thing would fall apart.

494
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:20,818
So you know, it's not reasonable to destroy the game that you're winning.

495
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,916
It's reasonable to strengthen the game that you're winning.

496
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:35,996
And so that's another thing, because that also describes the ethic that should allow you to be an active member of the community around which that gathers around that center.

497
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:49,194
So one of the things I've learned about the hero mythology that I really, really like is, so you see this pretty clearly in the figure of Christ, but because two things are conjoined in that story.

498
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:55,440
But Christ is also the hero, there's two kinds of heroes, there's the hero that goes out into chaos

499
00:51:55,464 --> 00:52:02,364
and confronts the dragon of chaos and gathers the the treasure as a consequence and then shares it with the community

500
00:52:02,364 --> 00:52:09,164
that's that's that's one the other form of hero is the hero who stands up against the corrupt state and

501
00:52:09,183 --> 00:52:19,320
rattles the foundation of the state has it collapse and then reconstructs it right so because the two great dangers to human beings are unprotected exposure

502
00:52:19,621 --> 00:52:25,805
to the catastrophes of the natural world and subjugation to tyranny right those are the two major dangers.

503
00:52:25,805 --> 00:52:37,191
And so a hero is, their ultimate hero is the person who reconstructs the structure of the state by using the information that he gathered by going out into the unknown.

504
00:52:37,191 --> 00:52:38,698
That unites them both.

505
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:44,915
And so what that means, here's the rub, as far as I can tell.

506
00:52:44,915 --> 00:52:46,600
So a structure, a center,

507
00:52:47,202 --> 00:52:50,713
has two risks associated with it.

508
00:52:50,713 --> 00:52:52,779
One is that it will degenerate into chaos.

509
00:52:52,779 --> 00:52:52,960
And

510
00:52:53,544 --> 00:52:55,860
And the other is it will rigidify into tyranny and

511
00:52:57,564 --> 00:52:58,917
It'll degenerate into Chaos

512
00:53:00,521 --> 00:53:07,320
Even if it just stays doing what it's doing so if it just does exactly what it's doing and it doesn't change it will degenerate

513
00:53:07,781 --> 00:53:11,380
Because things change and if it doesn't change to keep up

514
00:53:11,902 --> 00:53:16,560
then it gets farther and farther away from the environment and it'll precipitously collapse and

515
00:53:17,462 --> 00:53:21,940
so and then if it just changes willy-nilly so that nobody can establish a

516
00:53:22,682 --> 00:53:28,160
a stable, centralizing aim, then it degenerates into chaos immediately, and no one can get along.

517
00:53:29,241 --> 00:53:38,515
So, there's a rule for belonging to the community, and the rule has to be that you have to act in a manner that sustains and...

518
00:53:39,322 --> 00:53:42,456
that sustains the community and increases its competence.

519
00:53:42,456 --> 00:53:46,268
That's the fundamental moral obligation for belonging.

520
00:53:46,268 --> 00:53:48,034
Well, and obviously so, right?

521
00:53:48,034 --> 00:53:49,760
Because why would you belong to a...

522
00:53:50,525 --> 00:53:52,720
Why would you walk into a clubhouse that was on fire?

523
00:53:53,502 --> 00:53:55,373
Like that's just not smart, right?

524
00:53:55,373 --> 00:53:56,539
If you're going to be part of the game

525
00:53:57,742 --> 00:54:03,240
If you've decided that being part of the game is worthwhile, you've also taken on the moral

526
00:54:04,461 --> 00:54:09,540
You've also decided, even if you didn't notice it, that you have to work to support that game

527
00:54:09,564 --> 00:54:18,164
because by deciding to play that game You've said that it's valuable, and if it's valuable then obviously you should work to sustain and expand it

528
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:28,467
because that's the definition of having a relationship with something that's valuable and so that's the criteria for membership in the community

529
00:54:28,491 --> 00:54:37,391
and that's partly why if you regard the cross say as the symbol of voluntary suffering take you know suffering accepted voluntarily

530
00:54:37,461 --> 00:54:44,233
something like that which is means that there's another element of that too that's worth thinking about

531
00:54:44,257 --> 00:54:49,457
so you know the reason that Cain gets so out of hand Is because he's suffering and he won't accept it.

532
00:54:49,533 --> 00:54:57,060
He certainly won't accept responsibility for it He's angry and bitter about it and no wonder right I mean we have to be realistic about these sorts of things

533
00:54:57,682 --> 00:55:00,840
There you guys all of you people are going to suffer at some point in your life

534
00:55:01,723 --> 00:55:11,000
To the point where you're angry and bitter about it I mean, there's just absolutely no doubt about that and you're even going to think well It's no bloody wonder that I am angry and bitter about it

535
00:55:11,281 --> 00:55:16,980
everyone would be and things are so god-awful that there's no excuse for them to even exist and

536
00:55:18,024 --> 00:55:23,774
Like that's a powerful Argument although I think it's ultimately self-defeating.

537
00:55:23,774 --> 00:55:25,540
Well, that's kind of what the story of Cain and Abel

538
00:55:27,101 --> 00:55:29,889
That's kind of what the story of Cain and Abel.

539
00:55:29,889 --> 00:55:31,173
What would you say?

540
00:55:31,173 --> 00:55:33,580
That's the moral of the story of Cain and Abel essentially

541
00:55:36,628 --> 00:55:44,940
So what that means instead is that even under those conditions of relatively intense suffering, you have to accept it voluntarily, because otherwise it turns you against being,

542
00:55:45,201 --> 00:55:50,819
and then you start to act in this terrible manner that makes everything worse.

543
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:53,472
And it seems to me that there's a contradiction in that.

544
00:55:53,472 --> 00:56:01,240
If the reason you're complaining is that things are bad, then it isn't reasonable for you to act in a manner that makes them worse, right?

545
00:56:01,802 --> 00:56:07,400
I mean even if it's no wonder that people do that, but it's it's a degenerating game, and so that's

546
00:56:08,461 --> 00:56:16,520
so the the idea part of the idea of the cross and the suffering that it represents is that if you can accept that

547
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:29,480
Voluntarily regardless of its intensity then you won't become Embittered and resentful and vengeful to the point where you pose a danger to the stability of the community

548
00:56:30,946 --> 00:56:40,360
So or to your own stability for that matter because it's you know it might be your own stability the stability of your family the stability of the community and the stability of the world it might be all of that and

549
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,114
Increasingly, I think it is all of that so

550
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:47,268
okay, so

551
00:56:50,923 --> 00:56:52,999
Now Jacob we get the second part of Jacob story

552
00:56:58,109 --> 00:57:08,013
He goes to meet his uncle, Laban, and he meets Rachel there, again by a well, he falls in love and goes to live with Laban.

553
00:57:08,013 --> 00:57:12,609
There are two daughters there, Leah as well as Rachel.

554
00:57:12,609 --> 00:57:15,999
Leah is not a particularly attractive person.

555
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:19,195
It isn't exactly clear why, but the story makes it quite clear.

556
00:57:19,195 --> 00:57:28,540
She's definitely the least desirable of the two daughters and the story makes reference to her eyes and it isn't clear if there's something wrong with her physiologically

557
00:57:28,564 --> 00:57:33,764
or if there's something wrong with her attitude it's not obvious but doesn't really matter the point is

558
00:57:33,862 --> 00:57:46,057
she's the older daughter but she's the less desirable one. Jacob stays a month which is the limit of hospitality in in that time if you stayed for a month you were welcome

559
00:57:46,081 --> 00:57:52,581
but you had to work for your keep I think after about three days something like that which seems rather reasonable and

560
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:59,580
so he stays a month and then he has a chat with Laban and he says he's fallen in love with Rachel by this time

561
00:57:59,604 --> 00:58:09,804
and he says I'll stay with you and work for seven years and then I'll wed Rachel if and Laban says that's a fine deal and

562
00:58:09,822 --> 00:58:25,180
then the seven years passes and there's a wedding ceremony it's quite a long thing and the bride is veiled and the bride goes into the tent with with Jacob

563
00:58:25,742 --> 00:58:29,255
and if I remember the story correctly I haven't looked at it for a month or so

564
00:58:31,201 --> 00:58:42,740
Rachel is outside the tent speaking but Leah is inside the tent and so Jacob thinks he's getting married to Rachel but he's actually getting married to

565
00:58:43,081 --> 00:58:54,018
and this is it's an inversion a because he's in the dark like Isaac was when he fooled Isaac so now it's Jacob's turn to be in the dark and he gets betrayed by

566
00:58:54,600 --> 00:59:06,380
his uncle and his bride-to-be Rachel and her sister in a manner that's broadly parallel to the trick that he pulled on Esau and so there's a karma notion there

567
00:59:06,862 --> 00:59:14,038
which I which I'd like you know I mean you might think of karma as a superstitious idea, but...

568
00:59:16,181 --> 00:59:20,919
There are ways of interpreting it that might make it the case, but I don't think that's what it is.

569
00:59:20,919 --> 00:59:21,220
It's that

570
00:59:22,442 --> 00:59:24,333
no bad deed goes unpunished.

571
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:25,419
It's something like that.

572
00:59:25,419 --> 00:59:25,680
It's like...

573
00:59:29,641 --> 00:59:36,440
You know, maybe you've done something bad to someone and therefore there's part of you that feels quite guilty about that, hopefully, and

574
00:59:37,021 --> 00:59:43,480
And, that part is looking for punishment to set the stage right.

575
00:59:44,282 --> 00:59:50,560
And you might think, well no, but things are yes, unless you're a psychopath, that's how things work.

576
00:59:51,485 --> 00:59:54,560
If you're interested in that kind of thing, you should read Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment,

577
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:57,560
because it's the definitive study of that sort of phenomena.

578
00:59:58,223 --> 01:00:02,560
Because in that book, the main protagonist, Raskolnikov, gets away with murder.

579
01:00:02,882 --> 01:00:05,560
Like he does it successfully, no one suspects him.

580
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:12,440
And he drives himself so crazy with guilt that he basically falls into the hands of the police.

581
01:00:12,962 --> 01:00:17,460
He drives himself into the hands of the police because he can't tolerate what he did.

582
01:00:18,004 --> 01:00:19,560
It's very, it's amazing, it's an amazing book.

583
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:30,560
But anyways, the point is here, Jacob falls prey to the same sort of crookedness that he used to ratchet himself up the ladder.

584
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:34,500
And that happens far more often in life than people think.

585
01:00:34,902 --> 01:00:39,020
Think and it's really not like he can complain about it right not if he has any sense

586
01:00:39,321 --> 01:00:43,800
It's like he does he brings leah out to see laban, and he says

587
01:00:45,121 --> 01:00:48,172
What's what's with this sister?

588
01:00:48,172 --> 01:00:50,340
You know and laban basically says to him

589
01:00:52,465 --> 01:01:02,480
in our culture, it's the Custom to marry the eldest daughter first which is exactly right, and he said well it would bring you know He's rationalizing obviously

590
01:01:02,504 --> 01:01:08,204
because he's just screwed over Jacob in a major way, but it's a little late

591
01:01:08,225 --> 01:01:19,918
To take it back that the marriage has been consummated and the ceremony has been complete and all hell would break out if there was any attempt to sever the relationship, so

592
01:01:21,383 --> 01:01:26,520
that's how it is so lee is married and Jacob has the wrong wife

593
01:01:27,665 --> 01:01:31,360
So then so this is Jacob there you see on the left

594
01:01:31,641 --> 01:01:37,640
He's got the little flowery hat and he's pointing to Leah, and he's saying like what what's up here?

595
01:01:42,813 --> 01:01:42,915
And

596
01:01:43,381 --> 01:01:50,208
Laban you know Laban is tough old goat, and he's not really all that sad about it in fact you can imagine that He's kind of going

597
01:01:51,704 --> 01:01:51,825
so

598
01:01:53,803 --> 01:01:55,840
So okay, then he has to work another seven years

599
01:01:59,128 --> 01:02:03,080
And he gains Rachel, but because God is a tricky character

600
01:02:04,644 --> 01:02:06,058
There's another twist in this story

601
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:14,500
Rachel Turns out not to be very good at having children or Rachel and Jacob turn out not to be very good at having children

602
01:02:15,004 --> 01:02:15,691
but Leah

603
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:18,318
She's really good at having kids

604
01:02:19,504 --> 01:02:19,646
so

605
01:02:21,364 --> 01:02:27,559
she provides Jacob with Reuben, Simeon, Levi, or it's Levi I believe, and Judah.

606
01:02:28,481 --> 01:02:31,351
And the names of those, the meanings of those names are there.

607
01:02:31,351 --> 01:02:34,020
Reuben means see a son, Simeon means hearing.

608
01:02:34,502 --> 01:02:36,575
Though, I think that was the Lord heard my prayer.

609
01:02:36,575 --> 01:02:37,500
I think that's what that was.

610
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:40,880
Levi means joined, Judah means praise to Yahuwah.

611
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:46,349
And it's Judah from whose tribe Christ arises.

612
01:02:46,349 --> 01:02:50,320
Judah is essentially promoted to the status of firstborn later in the story.

613
01:02:50,742 --> 01:03:03,360
this is important, because Reuben, Simeon, and Levi all do something reprehensible, and so Judah gets promoted to firstborn, and that's partly why,

614
01:03:04,402 --> 01:03:09,337
in the logic of this narrative, that it's from the tribe of Judah that Christ arises.

615
01:03:12,422 --> 01:03:17,280
So now, while this is going on, Rachel is, like, suicidally desperate for children.

616
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:24,320
She's jealous of her older sister who's rather ill-favored as we pointed out, but who seems to be damn good at producing sons and

617
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:32,200
She's really not happy with Jacob, and so she chews him out and Jacob basically says like what do you want me to do about it?

618
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:35,237
I'm not God which is a reasonable response.

619
01:03:35,237 --> 01:03:40,811
I would say and So in her desperation she gives Jacob billa.

620
01:03:40,811 --> 01:03:42,556
Who's her maidservant.

621
01:03:42,556 --> 01:03:43,960
We've seen that sort of thing happen before

622
01:03:47,743 --> 01:03:57,560
To Billa produces two children dan and naph telly the reason I'm detailing out all these sons, it's important because Jacob is the founder of Israel and

623
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:04,559
His sons are the founder of the 12 tribes, so it's a pivotal moment in the story, right?

624
01:04:04,902 --> 01:04:08,515
it's because he's that he's the fundamental patriarch of of

625
01:04:09,361 --> 01:04:14,780
Those who wrestle with God because as we'll see that's what the name israel means he gets the name israel

626
01:04:15,282 --> 01:04:21,180
You'll see why in a while, but but it's you need to know these genealogies in this situation because

627
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:25,140
They play an important role in everything that happens afterwards

628
01:04:26,244 --> 01:04:30,613
so Naphtali is the second

629
01:04:32,343 --> 01:04:38,780
And her name or his name means with great wrestling's I've wrestled with my sister right contended with her and have prevailed

630
01:04:39,946 --> 01:04:40,108
so

631
01:04:41,523 --> 01:04:44,000
That gives you some indication of the tension in the household

632
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,786
Now, Leah is now past bearing children.

633
01:04:47,786 --> 01:04:54,199
She gives Jacob her maidservant too, Zilpah, to keep up with her sister, I guess.

634
01:04:54,980 --> 01:05:03,740
And now, Zilpah bears two children for Jacob, so he's piling up the kids left, right, and center here.

635
01:05:05,365 --> 01:05:09,660
One of them is named Gad, good fortune, and the other is named Asher, happy or blessed.

636
01:05:10,422 --> 01:05:14,574
So, there's more rivalry going on between the sisters.

637
01:05:14,574 --> 01:05:16,599
This is quite an interesting little story.

638
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:22,720
So, Reuben, who's Leah's daughter, goes out and looks for mandrakes.

639
01:05:23,302 --> 01:05:27,338
Now, mandrakes have aphrodisiac properties, so that's a little odd to begin with.

640
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:29,780
But, it doesn't matter, that's what happens.

641
01:05:30,182 --> 01:05:31,649
And, Rachel is...

642
01:05:34,804 --> 01:05:38,358
Rachel wants the mandrakes, because she's still interested in having some children,

643
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:43,857
She bargains with Leah to give her a night with Jacob in exchange for the Mandrakes,

644
01:05:44,841 --> 01:05:48,576
and more sons emerge as a consequence of that.

645
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:54,776
So then Rachel finally gives birth, Joseph.

646
01:05:56,180 --> 01:06:04,998
And Joseph plays a key role in the last story in Genesis, which I hope we'll get to in the next lecture, and then we can close off Genesis.

647
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:06,249
That's the plan, anyways.

648
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:13,620
So now, Jacob isn't really very happy about the whole arrangement, because he's been there 14 years,

649
01:06:14,081 --> 01:06:24,033
and he's got two wives, it's not too bad, but, you know, the bargain wasn't exactly clean, he doesn't really trust Laban, and there's no reason for him to do so.

650
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:32,438
Laban was poor before Jacob came, Jacob turns out to be a very useful person to have around,

651
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:43,675
And so he tells Laban he wants to leave and go back to his home country, and that he'll take the speckled and spotted cattle, the brown sheep, and the spotted and speckled goats from the flock.

652
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,056
And they're in the minority, so that's the idea.

653
01:06:47,082 --> 01:06:50,898
And so Laban takes all those animals out of his flock.

654
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:56,198
So there was an idea that the speckled goats and the brown sheep would breed true.

655
01:06:56,961 --> 01:07:04,500
So if you have a male goat and a female goat, and they're both speckled, they'll have speckled kids that's the theory

656
01:07:04,524 --> 01:07:12,824
and the same with brown sheep and so what Laban does is he takes all the speckled animals out of the flocks gives them to his son and

657
01:07:12,882 --> 01:07:19,536
they go three days away with them so that Jacob is left with the flock but with no with none of these animals

658
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:26,760
now the idea was that all the what newborns were going to be his and so what Laban has basically done is set it up so that in principle

659
01:07:26,784 --> 01:07:35,284
Jacob is going to get nothing for his work so that's another time when Jacob experiences betrayal.

660
01:07:35,336 --> 01:07:41,060
You know, it's almost as if God isn't done with reminding him of the magnitude of what he did in the past.

661
01:07:41,241 --> 01:07:44,655
That's the moral of the story in some sense.

662
01:07:44,655 --> 01:07:47,086
Now, there's a weird little twist in the story here.

663
01:07:47,086 --> 01:07:50,060
So what Jacob does is some sympathetic magic, and so

664
01:07:50,542 --> 01:08:00,548
when the animals are rutting, he puts speckled objects in front of them, speckled branches and so forth, I guess to remind them about what they're supposed to be producing.

665
01:08:00,548 --> 01:08:01,714
Something like that.

666
01:08:01,714 --> 01:08:02,397
And it works.

667
01:08:02,397 --> 01:08:03,040
And so all these

668
01:08:03,682 --> 01:08:08,939
animals that Laban left are producing spotted animals like mad.

669
01:08:08,939 --> 01:08:09,220
And so

670
01:08:09,762 --> 01:08:15,120
that's, I guess God's changed his mind and let Jacob off the hook slightly here.

671
01:08:15,962 --> 01:08:19,592
So, soon he was very wealthy.

672
01:08:19,592 --> 01:08:22,320
Much cattle, maidservants, menservants, camels, and asses.

673
01:08:22,842 --> 01:08:26,558
Laban's son's become jealous and Laban is outraged.

674
01:08:26,558 --> 01:08:32,840
Well, you know, Obviously there's some competition there between Jacob and the sons which is hardly surprising and the band played this trick to

675
01:08:33,381 --> 01:08:38,560
Strip Jacob of all his property and instead he got far more than he was going to get to begin with so you can imagine

676
01:08:38,821 --> 01:08:44,140
That's been a bit annoying so Jacob thinks he better get out of there, so he tells Rachel and Leah

677
01:08:45,382 --> 01:08:49,440
And said unto them I see your father's countenance that it's not toward me as before

678
01:08:50,382 --> 01:08:57,820
But the God of my father has been with me and you know with all my power I've served your father and your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times

679
01:08:58,422 --> 01:09:06,700
But God so far has suffered him not to hurt me if he said thus The speckled shall be thy wages then all the cattle bore speckled

680
01:09:07,123 --> 01:09:15,800
And if he said thus the ring straight shall be thy higher Then all the cattle bore ring straight thus God has taken away the cattle of your father and given them to me

681
01:09:16,864 --> 01:09:18,599
and they decide to sneak away and

682
01:09:19,383 --> 01:09:23,700
And they're unhappy with the inheritance and lack of inheritance from Lebann so as they sneak away

683
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:34,820
Rachel steals the idols that her father has in his house, and it's not exactly obvious Why there's a lot of contention about why she's doing that some of them is to punish him

684
01:09:35,823 --> 01:09:40,340
To bring with her the images of her ancestors You know maybe she's lonesome moving away from home

685
01:09:40,922 --> 01:09:44,440
Just out of spite to show him that the idols were actually powerless

686
01:09:45,404 --> 01:09:49,580
for protection to stop her father from divining the route of their escape.

687
01:09:49,580 --> 01:10:01,428
That last one is the strangest one because the idea would be that Laban would have used some sort of ritual with the idols that would help him infer their escape route and then could chase them.

688
01:10:01,428 --> 01:10:04,504
So anyways that's the range of speculation about that.

689
01:10:04,504 --> 01:10:08,180
I think it sounds to me mostly like a little act of revenge

690
01:10:09,182 --> 01:10:15,718
maybe with a bit of loneliness mixed in, Laban pursues them.

691
01:10:15,718 --> 01:10:19,855
But God comes in to dream to tell him to leave Jacob unharmed.

692
01:10:19,855 --> 01:10:27,010
Laban catches up with him and reproaches Jacob, saying that he would have thrown a great party if he would have known that they were going to leave.

693
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:29,324
You know, he didn't want them to sneak away in the night.

694
01:10:29,324 --> 01:10:32,441
And you can't tell from the story whether that's true or not.

695
01:10:32,441 --> 01:10:36,800
And, you know, these people were pretty rough and impulsive, I would say.

696
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:44,000
And maybe there was a 50% chance of a slaughter and a 50% chance of a party who knows I've been to parties like that actually

697
01:10:44,984 --> 01:10:45,105
so

698
01:10:47,401 --> 01:10:57,340
Laban complains that his gods are gone and Jacob says that whoever has them He will have them killed and Rachel who's really quite a sneaky character all things considered

699
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:06,000
basically claims that she's having her period and she's sitting on the a carpet with all the idols underneath

700
01:11:06,024 --> 01:11:14,024
and she can't move and so they search everywhere and can't find them and she's like laughing away behind her hand about that sneaky little maneuver

701
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:24,124
but she doesn't die so that's probably a good thing so the man checks everything out checks the camp out and he can't find anything so

702
01:11:24,148 --> 01:11:32,648
they reconcile and so that's the first reconciliation that Jacob engages in it's sort of like the

703
01:11:32,648 --> 01:11:49,848
what would you say the karmic debt has been paid that's one way of thinking about it that's so he got punished for his wrongdoing he's learned his lesson perhaps and it's

704
01:11:49,883 --> 01:11:53,959
it's that's good enough as far as he's concerned you know he got away good enough

705
01:11:54,280 --> 01:12:09,300
and they make peace so then the next thing that happens as they're traveling is that Jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man man angel God

706
01:12:09,324 --> 01:12:16,924
it's not clear we'll go with angel with him until the breaking of the day or God

707
01:12:16,942 --> 01:12:23,660
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him

708
01:12:24,021 --> 01:12:29,100
And he said let me go for the day breaks and Jacob said I will not let you go unless you bless me

709
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:52,600
And the angel said unto him What is thy name and Jacob said Jacob and the angel said thy name shall no more be called Jacob so the supplanter right the the overthrower with that kind of

710
01:12:53,840 --> 01:13:01,120
Intonation of or implication of crookedness, but Israel which means he who wrestles or strives successfully with God

711
01:13:02,004 --> 01:13:06,120
For as a prince, hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.

712
01:13:06,642 --> 01:13:07,686
That's quite a story.

713
01:13:07,686 --> 01:13:11,100
I don't know exactly what to make of it.

714
01:13:11,601 --> 01:13:18,220
There's obviously a symbolic level of meaning, which is that that is what human beings do in some sense,

715
01:13:18,244 --> 01:13:25,944
is they wrestle, I would say they wrestle with the divine, even with the concept of the divine for that matter.

716
01:13:29,062 --> 01:13:32,180
But the question is do they prevail like it's kind of odd thing that

717
01:13:33,221 --> 01:13:37,500
Jacob actually seems to win this battle right or at least he wins it enough so that

718
01:13:38,261 --> 01:13:46,171
Whoever he's wrestling this divine figure that he's wrestling is willing to bestow a blessing on him I guess maybe that's a testament to his courage.

719
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:47,516
It's something like that.

720
01:13:47,516 --> 01:13:48,720
Maybe it's an indication that

721
01:13:49,862 --> 01:14:01,562
He has paid for his sins sufficiently so that he's sort of back on the moral high ground ground but but I think it's really telling that the transformation of the name from Jacob to Israel

722
01:14:01,586 --> 01:14:13,186
and that what Israel means is he who wrestles with God or who struggles with God and perhaps successfully but it's also so interesting that he actually emerges victorious

723
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:20,910
you know you wouldn't necessarily think that that would be a possibility especially given you know God's rather hot-headed nature in the Old Testament

724
01:14:20,934 --> 01:14:28,534
you don't want to mess with him too much but but Jacob does it successfully but even more importantly is the idea that

725
01:14:28,558 --> 01:14:37,858
whatever Israel constitutes which would be to say the land that Jacob founds is actually composed of those who wrestle with God

726
01:14:37,881 --> 01:14:43,539
I think that's an amazing idea because it also seems to me to shed some light on

727
01:14:44,503 --> 01:14:51,537
perhaps what was meant by belief in those days you know like I've often thought of marriage as a wrestling match, right?

728
01:14:51,537 --> 01:14:54,973
If you're lucky, the person that you marry is someone you contend with.

729
01:14:54,973 --> 01:14:59,913
It's not exactly... I don't think it's exactly... It's not tranquil, precisely.

730
01:14:59,913 --> 01:15:02,984
You know, you might have noticed that, some of you.

731
01:15:02,984 --> 01:15:10,694
But the thing is, if you have something to contend against, then that strengthens you.

732
01:15:10,694 --> 01:15:21,940
And that's actually better than having nothing to contend against and so Jacob is the person who's also strengthened by the necessity of this contending

733
01:15:22,001 --> 01:15:29,212
and that seems to be the proper relationship with God or the angel is that contending the battling right

734
01:15:29,236 --> 01:15:42,436
rather than some sort of kind of loose weak statement of belief I mean I'm not trying to denigrate that to any great degree it just doesn't seem like like the right mode of conceptualization, right?

735
01:15:42,512 --> 01:15:45,122
Because human beings aren't, aren't like that.

736
01:15:45,122 --> 01:15:48,895
We're, we're contentious creatures.

737
01:15:48,895 --> 01:15:52,750
And that actually seems to be something that meets with God's favor in this situation.

738
01:15:52,750 --> 01:16:04,593
So, especially given that that's actually what he names the, well, the whole kingdom of the chosen people, is, the idea is that that's composed of those who contend with God.

739
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:18,263
So that's, that's a hell of an idea, that that's for sure and Jacob asked him and said tell me I pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it thou dost ask after by name

740
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:26,887
so there's no that's not happening and he blessed him there and Jacob called the place of the name of the place penile for I or penial for I've seen God face to face

741
01:16:26,911 --> 01:16:33,211
and my life is preserved and he passed over penile the Sun rose upon him and he halted upon on his thigh.

742
01:16:33,263 --> 01:16:46,210
Now, Jacob does walk away injured from this, right, so he has a permanent limp after that, and so that's also an indication of just how dangerous that contention actually is.

743
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:49,883
Like, he gets blessed, he wins, but he doesn't get away scot-free.

744
01:16:49,883 --> 01:17:01,542
And so, now, so Jacob goes back to Esau, and he's terrified, even though it's been 14 years, he thinks maybe his hot-headed brother hasn't calmed down yet.

745
01:17:01,542 --> 01:17:07,977
And he has good reason to think that, I would say.

746
01:17:07,977 --> 01:17:11,932
So he sends messengers to Esau, who then sets out with 400 men.

747
01:17:11,932 --> 01:17:15,046
And so Jacob is not very happy with this whole idea.

748
01:17:15,046 --> 01:17:18,884
And he breaks his people into two bands, so that maybe half of them cannot be killed.

749
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:27,998
And then he takes from his large flocks a bunch of animals, and a bunch of servants, and he sends them out to meet Esau, basically to say, look

750
01:17:28,861 --> 01:17:37,060
I'm I'm a jerk and sorry about the whole birthright thing and and here's some animals and you know maybe

751
01:17:38,061 --> 01:17:40,971
Maybe that's the beginnings of an apology.

752
01:17:40,971 --> 01:17:47,872
It's something like that and so, but he's not very Convinced that that's actually going to work but Esau

753
01:17:48,922 --> 01:17:54,480
Who actually turns out to perhaps have matured in the interim perhaps that's one way of thinking about it

754
01:17:56,225 --> 01:18:06,520
Meets Jacob and says that just seeing him is enough, but Jacob insists that he takes the gift and Esau accepts and which is probably a wise thing because

755
01:18:07,701 --> 01:18:18,020
Even if Esau is 95% convinced that just seeing his brother is enough There's probably five percent of them that's still really not all that happy and so you have to be careful

756
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:29,657
you know when you say that you forgive someone because there might be a part of you that really doesn't, that really needs something else before you can actually say, okay look, fine.

757
01:18:29,657 --> 01:18:41,490
You know, and you don't want to fool yourself about that because that five percent that hasn't been completely convinced will find its voice at some point and then maybe undermine the whole reconciliation process.

758
01:18:41,490 --> 01:18:45,106
You don't want to think that you're any better than you are, or any nicer than you are.

759
01:18:45,106 --> 01:18:46,591
It's not helpful.

760
01:18:46,591 --> 01:18:54,458
And so Esau is smart, I think, so while Jacob's smart to say, no, no, like, thanks a lot, but take the damn goats, and

761
01:18:55,582 --> 01:19:09,629
Jacob and Esau are smart enough to accept that, and he might do that maybe to, you know, to please Jacob, but also, I think, so that there really is the possibility of establishing peace.

762
01:19:09,629 --> 01:19:19,779
Because, hypothetically, the gift that's being offered is of sufficient magnitude to erase the debt of the loss of the birthright it's something like that

763
01:19:19,803 --> 01:19:35,003
it's the payment of the real debt and Esau said what meanest thou by all this drove which I met and Jacob said these are to find grace in the sight of my Lord and

764
01:19:35,043 --> 01:19:41,260
Esau says I have enough brother keep thou keep that that thou hast unto thyself

765
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:57,284
and Jacob said and this is interesting statement I think no I pray you, if I have now found grace in thy sight, take the present at my hand.

766
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:03,464
For therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and now was pleased with me."

767
01:20:03,464 --> 01:20:12,797
And so that's, so he's, he's taking the honorable judgment of his brother, because it is honorable, because Esau did get betrayed.

768
01:20:12,797 --> 01:20:16,047
So he has a right to be standing in judgment.

769
01:20:16,047 --> 01:20:22,608
And he equates that judgment with, with what would you say, with the highest of virtues.

770
01:20:22,608 --> 01:20:24,275
It's appropriate judgment.

771
01:20:24,275 --> 01:20:34,039
And so, he wants to make complete amends to Esau, as if Esau is a representative of the divine element of justice.

772
01:20:34,039 --> 01:20:38,034
And, I guess that's convincing to Esau.

773
01:20:38,034 --> 01:20:38,980
It's quite a thing to say.

774
01:20:39,962 --> 01:20:44,459
You know, that I need to be reconciled to you because that would simultaneously reconcile me with God.

775
01:20:44,941 --> 01:20:46,608
It's like, it's crucial.

776
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:56,880
This is between us, but it's, there's a higher principle at stake That's vital, and I think that is the case with betrayal That's very frequently the case because if you betray someone you really have violated

777
01:20:58,001 --> 01:20:59,346
You've deeply violated.

778
01:20:59,346 --> 01:21:01,733
What can only be called a sacred trust.

779
01:21:01,733 --> 01:21:04,020
It's the right terminology for that take it

780
01:21:04,301 --> 01:21:12,614
I pray the my blessing that is brought to thee because God has dealt graciously with me and because I have enough and he urged Him and he took it

781
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:16,060
So you know the story seems to be something like

782
01:21:17,584 --> 01:21:26,639
well Jacob was Kind of an arrogant, crooked, deceitful character, maybe over-impressed with his own ability.

783
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:31,377
He thought it was pretty amusing to pull a fast trick or two on his brother.

784
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:39,172
Then he ran off, which is not all that brave, and then he got walloped a lot and perhaps learned something.

785
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:42,136
And then when he came back, you know, he was a different person.

786
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:43,423
And so that's a...

787
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:48,373
That's a reasonable story.

788
01:21:48,980 --> 01:22:00,411
And you know, he has to repent completely about what he did before he can rectify the situation properly, and he's willing to do that.

789
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:11,500
So that's an interesting idea too, because it's an early reflection of the idea that it is, if you do something wrong in the past,

790
01:22:11,524 --> 01:22:22,424
A, that you can learn from it, right, so that you're actually capable of learning and B that you can set the balance right in the present those are very optimistic ideas you know

791
01:22:22,448 --> 01:22:33,048
because you might say well once you've committed some sort of crime that's it there's no hope for you but that's pretty rough because the probability that you've done unethical

792
01:22:33,122 --> 01:22:43,060
things at some point in your life is a hundred percent and so if there was no way of setting the balance right after that then everybody would be doomed so

793
01:22:43,681 --> 01:22:49,453
So, so then the story gets rough again.

794
01:22:49,453 --> 01:22:52,920
Jacob settles in Shelem, or Shelem.

795
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:56,495
Dinah, his daughter, goes looking around for friends.

796
01:22:56,495 --> 01:23:00,994
Shechem, the son of Hamor, lays with her, and then wants her for his wife.

797
01:23:00,994 --> 01:23:02,861
He actually has the order reversed there.

798
01:23:02,861 --> 01:23:05,029
That turns out to be a problem.

799
01:23:05,029 --> 01:23:06,936
Jacob hears of this.

800
01:23:06,936 --> 01:23:08,220
The fathers talk, and

801
01:23:08,563 --> 01:23:10,079
And so, they make an agreement.

802
01:23:11,941 --> 01:23:22,959
The agreement is that if all of Hammer's men, including Hammer and his son, are circumcised, so that's the proper offering, I guess that brings them into the familial fold,

803
01:23:23,401 --> 01:23:27,879
and indicates that they're willing to make a sacrifice to do so, especially after,

804
01:23:28,683 --> 01:23:31,179
you know, Shechem put the cart before the horse, let's say,

805
01:23:32,763 --> 01:23:35,259
the men of Hammer are circumcised, they agree to do so.

806
01:23:35,701 --> 01:23:42,200
That turns out to be a big mistake, so while they're laying around the next day, suffering madly from the circumcision,

807
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:49,280
Simeon and Levi come in, they sneak in and kill all of them, and take their wealth, and their women and children.

808
01:23:50,046 --> 01:23:50,614
That's rough.

809
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:51,949
It's rough.

810
01:23:54,783 --> 01:23:56,394
Yeah, I guess you guys noticed that, eh?

811
01:24:00,524 --> 01:24:02,260
So, they're honor societies, right?

812
01:24:02,581 --> 01:24:08,820
And there's still lots of honor societies in the world and so they don't take kindly to what happened to their to their sister

813
01:24:09,464 --> 01:24:10,495
Although they don't kill her

814
01:24:11,444 --> 01:24:11,606
so

815
01:24:14,664 --> 01:24:21,800
Now, it turns out that On the third day when they were in pain, Jacob's two sons Simeon and Levi

816
01:24:22,521 --> 01:24:27,000
Dinah's brethren took each man his sword and came upon the city boldly and slew all the males

817
01:24:27,742 --> 01:24:33,320
And they slew hammer and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword and took Dinah out of Shechem's house and went out

818
01:24:34,282 --> 01:24:38,680
The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and spoiled the city because they had defiled their sister

819
01:24:40,202 --> 01:24:47,700
they took the sheep and the oxen and the asses and that which was in the city and that was which it was in the Field and all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives

820
01:24:48,422 --> 01:24:51,920
took they came captive and spoiled everything else that was in the house and

821
01:24:52,662 --> 01:24:58,720
and Jacob actually turns out not to be very happy about that because he'd met with Hamor and they'd like hammered out a deal and

822
01:24:59,841 --> 01:25:05,560
That and that's where they were living and so he figured well that he was making the best of a bad lot

823
01:25:05,921 --> 01:25:09,000
let's say and his sons went behind his back and

824
01:25:10,321 --> 01:25:19,840
Jacob says to Simeon and Levi you have troubled me to make me To make me stink among the inhabitants of the land among the Canaanites and the parasites and I being few in number

825
01:25:20,743 --> 01:25:26,360
they shall gather themselves now together against me and slay me and I shall be destroyed I had my house and

826
01:25:27,422 --> 01:25:30,819
they said should he deal with our sister as with a harlot and

827
01:25:33,802 --> 01:25:37,300
God said unto Jacob, and this is where we get back to the idea of the center

828
01:25:38,023 --> 01:25:40,239
God says to Jacob arise go to Bethel and

829
01:25:41,562 --> 01:25:46,708
Dwell there, so Bethel was where Jacob had originally put that pillar Right so now it's back.

830
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:49,660
So it's it's it's a real hero's journey, right?

831
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:53,390
There's there's the place that he has a set place.

832
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:57,400
He goes out and has these adventures and and undergoes a moral transformation

833
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:03,155
Reconcils and then he comes back to the same place right as a transformed person.

834
01:26:03,155 --> 01:26:04,680
So that's a full hero cycle

835
01:26:05,761 --> 01:26:09,540
Arise go to Bethel and dwell there and make thou and there an altar unto God

836
01:26:10,162 --> 01:26:13,379
that appeared to thee when thou fled is from the face of Esau thy brother and

837
01:26:14,262 --> 01:26:19,560
And Jacob said to his household and to all that were with them put away the strange gods that are among you and

838
01:26:20,822 --> 01:26:25,240
Be clean and change your garments and let us arise and go up to Bethel

839
01:26:25,942 --> 01:26:32,494
And I will make there an altar unto God who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which I went and

840
01:26:33,942 --> 01:26:39,260
they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand and all their earrings which were in their ears and

841
01:26:39,901 --> 01:26:42,900
Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem and they journeyed

842
01:26:44,403 --> 01:26:49,360
And the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.

843
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:52,936
So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan.

844
01:26:52,936 --> 01:26:56,873
That is Bethel, so that's the place where he put up the pillar to begin with.

845
01:26:56,873 --> 01:26:58,460
He and all the people that were there with him.

846
01:26:59,003 --> 01:27:02,260
And he built there an altar, and called the place El-Bethel,

847
01:27:02,762 --> 01:27:05,659
because there God appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother.

848
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:11,256
And God appeared to Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram and blessed him.

849
01:27:11,256 --> 01:27:12,360
And God sent unto him,

850
01:27:13,263 --> 01:27:21,837
thy name is Jacob thy name shall not be called anymore Jacob which you remember means usurper but Israel shall be thy name

851
01:27:21,861 --> 01:27:30,661
he who wrestles with God and he called his name Israel and God said to him I am God Almighty be fruitful and multiply a nation

852
01:27:30,685 --> 01:27:42,785
and a company of nations shall be of thee and kings shall come out of thy loins and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land."

853
01:27:42,837 --> 01:27:45,430
And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.

854
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:50,398
And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, a pillar of stone.

855
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:54,275
And he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.

856
01:27:54,275 --> 01:28:06,577
And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.

857
01:28:06,577 --> 01:28:13,693
So he's returned to the central place which had been given to him as his territory.

858
01:28:13,693 --> 01:28:27,670
Rachel dies in labor in the process giving birth to Benoni son of my sorrow whose name was then changed to Benjamin son of the right hand now Reuben

859
01:28:29,844 --> 01:28:34,787
So Simeon and Levi have already Done something unforgivable now Reuben.

860
01:28:34,787 --> 01:28:36,010
It's Reuben's term.

861
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:39,820
He sleeps with Bilhah who's Jacob Israel's concubine

862
01:28:40,421 --> 01:28:46,080
So he's the third of the sons to make an unforgivable error and Jacob slash Israel gets wind of it

863
01:28:46,565 --> 01:28:47,878
So Ruben is no longer

864
01:28:48,803 --> 01:28:53,674
he would have been the premier son given that the two older sons were put out of the

865
01:28:54,462 --> 01:29:02,300
running so to speak because of their disobedience and impulsive vengeful Cruelty and then Ruben can't keep his

866
01:29:03,944 --> 01:29:05,840
What do they say well you get the idea?

867
01:29:07,922 --> 01:29:12,300
Yeah, yeah seems to be something that's still quite surprisingly common

868
01:29:15,586 --> 01:29:22,900
So then we have the story that basically ends with this establishment of the 12 tribes of Israel.

869
01:29:24,064 --> 01:29:28,400
From Leah, there's Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.

870
01:29:28,802 --> 01:29:30,570
From Zilpah, there's Gad and Asher.

871
01:29:30,570 --> 01:29:32,680
From Billa, there's Dan and Naphtali.

872
01:29:33,402 --> 01:29:42,770
And from Rachel, there's Joseph, who figures extraordinarily importantly in the next story that we're gonna cover which hopefully will wrap up Genesis and Benjamin

873
01:29:42,794 --> 01:30:06,794
and so now Israel itself is established and so then we turn to actually going to end this early tonight that's quite bloody miracle so then the story then turns to Joseph and

874
01:30:06,841 --> 01:30:15,159
The story begins essentially now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors and

875
01:30:16,604 --> 01:30:18,200
So what that seems to me to indicate?

876
01:30:19,201 --> 01:30:24,154
You know coats in dreams very often seems to be particularly true of women's dreams.

877
01:30:24,154 --> 01:30:32,078
That's that's been my clinical observation clothing footwear in particular symbolizes a role

878
01:30:32,965 --> 01:30:41,000
And that makes sense right because you dress for the roles it's not that big a mystery, but so then you might say well, what does a coat of many colors indicate and

879
01:30:42,524 --> 01:30:45,877
you know if you think of the multiplicity there

880
01:30:46,642 --> 01:30:50,900
It's something like the mastery of multiple domains right or maybe something like

881
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:57,880
Pluripotentiality and so Jacob is is Israel's or Joseph is Israel's favorite and

882
01:30:59,103 --> 01:31:04,960
Because he sees in him this excess possibility, and he basically tells his other sons that

883
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:11,780
Jacob is going to be the head son, which they are not happy with, right, because he's just this young punk fundamentally,

884
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:19,060
and he's clearly his father's favorite, and he gets this coat that's sort of indicative of this higher status, and so

885
01:31:20,062 --> 01:31:36,180
Israel inadvertently sets up a tremendous amount of sibling rivalry in the household again, and that and that's the understructure of the last story in Genesis.

886
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:40,454
And so, in the last of this lecture series for 2017,

887
01:31:43,063 --> 01:31:52,979
we'll cover the story of Joseph and his coat of many colors and what happens as a consequence of the favoritism shown to him by his father.

888
01:31:53,762 --> 01:31:58,439
And we'll track what happens as a consequence of that.

889
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:02,484
And so, I'm going to stop there because I'm finished.

890
01:32:02,484 --> 01:32:02,624
So...

891
01:32:08,313 --> 01:32:09,242
Hello, Dr. Peterson.

892
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:14,265
This is an idea I've been wrestling with for quite some time now.

893
01:32:15,791 --> 01:32:20,769
This idea of a lot of, like, the greatest sources of wisdom that we've received

894
01:32:21,572 --> 01:32:26,729
through human history, either through texts, experiences, or scriptures,

895
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:32,427
seems to always come from people going to isolation and then coming back.

896
01:32:33,390 --> 01:32:38,048
So I've had a hard time trying to figure out, from a scientific point of view

897
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:44,808
or evolutionary point of view, what would compel an organism that is centered

898
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:55,847
around its behavior, centered around surviving, especially for humans and social groups, as well as reproducing, to want to go into isolation

899
01:32:56,570 --> 01:33:03,590
And then, not only that, but, obtain some level of information that actually helps the group in coming back.

900
01:33:04,411 --> 01:33:05,508
That's a really good question.

901
01:33:07,352 --> 01:33:07,965
Okay, so...

902
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:13,929
There's this neuroscientist, neuropsychologist named L. Conan Goldberg.

903
01:33:15,251 --> 01:33:17,609
And Goldberg was a student of Alexander Luria.

904
01:33:18,111 --> 01:33:20,789
And Alexander Luria was a Russian neuropsychologist.

905
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:25,647
Perhaps the foremost neuropsychologist of the mid to late 20th century.

906
01:33:26,871 --> 01:33:33,470
And he had students, Sokolov and Vinogradova, who discovered the orienting reflex, for example.

907
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:39,490
The orienting reflex is the reflex that orients you when something anomalous interferes with your goal-directed behavior.

908
01:33:39,730 --> 01:33:50,169
It's a major discovery, like one of the four or five most important discoveries that have ever been made in psychology, I would say, certainly in neuroscience.

909
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:51,762
So Luria was a big deal.

910
01:33:53,412 --> 01:34:00,210
He was the first person who really established the functional role of the prefrontal cortex as well, so and had it very nice

911
01:34:01,971 --> 01:34:10,522
Overall view of how the brain functioned his book was written in 1980, and it's still there's still lots in it That's really useful which is pretty strange for a science.

912
01:34:10,522 --> 01:34:12,570
That's advanced that quickly anyways

913
01:34:13,972 --> 01:34:16,385
So Goldberg came from a great pedigree.

914
01:34:16,385 --> 01:34:21,967
I believe Luria's His teacher was Pavlov, if I remember correctly.

915
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:33,929
So anyways, Goldberg, you know, you hear, some of you may have heard the idea that the

916
01:34:34,910 --> 01:34:47,610
left hemisphere is more linguistic than the right hemisphere, is that the left hemisphere is specialized for language and the right hemisphere is specialized for nonverbal imagistic communication

917
01:34:47,634 --> 01:34:55,334
the left hemisphere has a pretty well organized micro structure and the right hemisphere is more diffuse as well

918
01:34:55,358 --> 01:35:07,758
and that's true in left-handed males in particular so the circuitry can be switched around a bit but it's okay the modules are basically the same although they can be moved a little bit

919
01:35:07,793 --> 01:35:14,960
but Goldberg thought that it isn't language versus non language it's routine versus novelty.

920
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:18,530
And so the left hemisphere, and there's a neuropsychologist

921
01:35:19,192 --> 01:35:25,935
physician named Ramachandran who's done some very interesting work that's pertinent to this.

922
01:35:25,935 --> 01:35:28,204
Maybe I'll tell you a story about him.

923
01:35:28,204 --> 01:35:36,750
Anyways, Goldberg believed that the right hemisphere, so you have very old systems underneath

924
01:35:37,413 --> 01:35:45,709
both cortical hemispheres that do things like respond to anomaly, to the thing that doesn't fit, to the predator in the distance.

925
01:35:45,709 --> 01:35:47,498
Some of that's extraordinarily fast.

926
01:35:47,498 --> 01:35:53,208
So that would be like a snake reflex that can move you away from a snake in less time than it takes the snake to bite.

927
01:35:53,208 --> 01:35:54,173
And it's really a reflex.

928
01:35:54,173 --> 01:35:55,438
It doesn't even hit your brain.

929
01:35:55,438 --> 01:35:57,508
It's really super fast.

930
01:35:57,508 --> 01:36:09,550
And then there's a defensive crouch that's instantiated higher up in the nervous But that's still remarkably fast, and then there's fear as an emotion and and the orientation of attention

931
01:36:09,971 --> 01:36:16,510
And then there's the cognitive processing and that all streams out across a time span right and maybe that time span is half a second

932
01:36:17,031 --> 01:36:23,050
So and that's really a long time if something is attacking you so you got it those initial responses are quite primitive

933
01:36:23,574 --> 01:36:25,029
But they're extraordinarily fast

934
01:36:26,032 --> 01:36:34,548
All right, so there's subcortical structures that orient you towards novelty and prepare you for for freezing or for attending.

935
01:36:35,154 --> 01:36:38,386
And the right hemisphere seems to be dominated by those systems.

936
01:36:38,952 --> 01:36:42,790
So imagine that what happens is that something threatens you,

937
01:36:43,053 --> 01:36:44,507
you orient towards it,

938
01:36:44,790 --> 01:36:47,699
the right hemisphere produces a bunch of images about what it might be.

939
01:36:48,790 --> 01:36:50,790
So imagine that's what happens when a child is afraid of the dark.

940
01:36:51,659 --> 01:36:52,527
The child's on the bed,

941
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:56,265
they're afraid of the dark, they're crouched because they're frozen like a prey animal,

942
01:36:56,790 --> 01:37:05,390
and their right hemisphere is producing monsters to inhabit the Darkness that are the child's hypotheses about what might be out there

943
01:37:06,656 --> 01:37:06,879
Okay

944
01:37:07,852 --> 01:37:11,210
Because that's what you want to know right you want to know what's out there

945
01:37:11,976 --> 01:37:13,670
And then you want to know what to do about it

946
01:37:14,252 --> 01:37:20,550
I can tell you two kids dreams that are sort of relevant to that so when my daughter was about three

947
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:21,921
she came into

948
01:37:23,612 --> 01:37:33,530
The bedroom that my wife and I had and she was crying she'd had a nightmare and she said that she saw a stream and there was garbage all over the stream and

949
01:37:34,534 --> 01:37:44,370
She didn't like that and so I sat her down I said okay, so imagine the stream with the garbage in it now imagine that you're taking the garbage out and throwing it in a Garbage bin

950
01:37:44,394 --> 01:37:53,294
and so she and I got her to like visualize that because that kind of puts her back in the semi dream state And then she cleaned up the mess and then she could go off to sleep

951
01:37:53,318 --> 01:38:03,782
now You could tell the child don't worry about the dream isn't real that's not that's true because it's not real like other Daytime things are but it's not like it's not real.

952
01:38:03,782 --> 01:38:05,749
It's a dream like a dream is real

953
01:38:06,171 --> 01:38:11,050
It's just not the same kind of real and so what I did with her was to

954
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:16,970
Indicate to her practically that if she saw something anomalous something that was out of place

955
01:38:17,752 --> 01:38:22,230
Right something that was a mess that it was within her capacity to set it, right?

956
01:38:23,494 --> 01:38:31,307
okay and so okay so now your right hemisphere tells you what monsters might inhabit the the darkness

957
01:38:31,331 --> 01:38:40,031
now what you have to do is figure out there's two things you have to figure out one is what to do about a given monster and

958
01:38:40,034 --> 01:38:46,646
other is to do what about is to figure out what to do about the class of all possible monsters right

959
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:52,270
that's a whole different thing that's something that only human beings are capable of that level of abstraction right

960
01:38:52,370 --> 01:38:59,170
and so what you might do about a particular monster is hide or go out and get rid of it if

961
01:38:59,190 --> 01:39:07,986
it was just an actual animal right but that doesn't help because there's all the other potential predators that are still there and so maybe you can go hunt all them down

962
01:39:08,010 --> 01:39:13,410
but that doesn't help either because you can't hunt them all down it's not it's not very likely anyways

963
01:39:13,434 --> 01:39:20,934
so instead what you have to do is figure out how to configure yourself so that you're in the best possible position to fight off the monsters when they come.

964
01:39:20,986 --> 01:39:21,810
That's your best bet.

965
01:39:22,854 --> 01:39:25,090
All right, so now people are trying to figure this out forever.

966
01:39:26,091 --> 01:39:31,650
They're trying to figure out, what's the answer to the problem of the class of all possible monsters?

967
01:39:32,652 --> 01:39:34,420
Part of that's sacrifice.

968
01:39:34,420 --> 01:39:43,730
So there are routines, for example, in Hinduism, with the goddess Kelly, you make offerings to Kelly who's this devouring goddess.

969
01:39:44,394 --> 01:39:46,870
And then she turns into her benevolent counterpart

970
01:39:47,431 --> 01:39:54,730
And so sacrifice is actually one way that you can tame the monsters if you think about the monster as the set of all Negative future potentialities you make the proper sacrifices those monsters stay at bay

971
01:39:55,271 --> 01:39:59,690
Negative future potentialities you make the proper sacrifices those monsters stay at bay

972
01:40:00,532 --> 01:40:05,510
But then there's heroism as an alternative to which which means the active

973
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:11,750
Confrontation of the class of all possible monsters in the building of yourself up into the sort of courageous person that can do that

974
01:40:12,532 --> 01:40:27,490
it took a tremendous amount of meditation to transform those images say of the monsters into it or to solve the problem of the class of those monsters

975
01:40:27,872 --> 01:40:29,944
so now I'll tell you another child's dream

976
01:40:29,968 --> 01:40:43,168
so some of you probably heard this before but it's such a great dream that it's worth it's worth telling so now is at my sister-in-law's house once and her son was running around.

977
01:40:43,244 --> 01:40:49,168
He's about four. Very precocious, very verbal, very intelligent.

978
01:40:49,168 --> 01:40:52,260
Running around with a knight hat on and a sword.

979
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:54,910
So he's engaged in this pretty intense play world.

980
01:40:55,694 --> 01:41:00,215
And when he goes to sleep, he puts the knight hat on his pillow and the sword by his pillow.

981
01:41:00,215 --> 01:41:03,547
And at the same time, he's having night terror.

982
01:41:03,547 --> 01:41:04,270
So he's waking up

983
01:41:04,692 --> 01:41:06,197
and had been for a number of weeks.

984
01:41:06,197 --> 01:41:08,887
Nate waking up screaming.

985
01:41:08,887 --> 01:41:21,049
And then, but he doesn't know why there's some things that aren't going so well in the household and the parents get divorced shortly afterwards okay so that's a that's that's what's going on underneath right

986
01:41:21,073 --> 01:41:25,973
and he's also going to go to kindergarten and so he's about to go into the world

987
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:40,097
and so he's coping with this you know so I'm watching him zoom around as this night and thinking that's pretty cool and that night he woke up and had a it was screaming and so we

988
01:41:40,110 --> 01:41:47,370
were all at breakfast the next morning and I said did you dream anything and he got really intense

989
01:41:47,394 --> 01:41:59,394
and he said yes I had a dream and I said well what was the dream and he said well I was out on this field and all these like dwarfs came up

990
01:41:59,431 --> 01:42:03,626
They're only about as high as my knees and they didn't have any arms.

991
01:42:03,626 --> 01:42:13,210
They have powerful legs and they were covered with like hairy feathers and grease and there was cross carved in the top of their head, and they had beaks and

992
01:42:15,032 --> 01:42:18,090
Whenever he moved anywhere they would jump at him with his with their beaks

993
01:42:18,692 --> 01:42:23,149
And there were lots of them and everyone like just said nothing at breakfast.

994
01:42:23,149 --> 01:42:23,490
It was like

995
01:42:25,620 --> 01:42:27,709
Because then he was right into this story, eh?

996
01:42:28,212 --> 01:42:31,810
And so we were all like, yeah, well, that accounts for all the screaming.

997
01:42:32,512 --> 01:42:37,770
And so, and then he said, yeah, and then in the background there was a dragon.

998
01:42:38,833 --> 01:42:44,869
And every time the dragon puffed out smoke, it would turn into these dwarves.

999
01:42:45,815 --> 01:42:48,270
It's like, oh man, kid, you really got a problem there.

1000
01:42:48,371 --> 01:42:51,030
You got, you got beat things that are biting you,

1001
01:42:51,833 --> 01:43:02,330
and you can kill them and that's fine but then there's the dragon just puffing out new ones so it's like a hydra problem right the old hydra is the serpent you cut off one head seven more grow

1002
01:43:02,354 --> 01:43:10,454
it's not a good thing and it's such a cool dream because it really portrayed this class of all possible monsters problem

1003
01:43:10,478 --> 01:43:15,278
so you've got the specific monsters and that's a problem so you've got to get rid of them

1004
01:43:15,278 --> 01:43:21,078
but that's not the problem the problem is is that there's a there's something in the background that's just generating monsters like mad

1005
01:43:21,102 --> 01:43:25,902
and so I said to him what do you think you could do about that

1006
01:43:25,926 --> 01:43:34,426
and that's a that's a loaded question right that's like leading the witness in a trial you don't get to ask a question like that because it implies

1007
01:43:34,451 --> 01:43:43,470
that it implies the answer what could you do about that is not any different than saying you could do something about that right so

1008
01:43:43,494 --> 01:43:51,494
so I hinted at that as a possibility and his eyes lit up now you remember he's already running around as a knight hey

1009
01:43:51,518 --> 01:43:58,718
so he kind of already knew what to do because he had the whole sword and the hat and with that you know that you can go after the dragon

1010
01:43:58,742 --> 01:44:06,242
he kind of got that and he said I'd get my dad and then I jump up on top of the dragon and

1011
01:44:06,252 --> 01:44:13,710
I'd poke out both of its eyes with my sword and then it go right down its throat to the firebox where the fire comes out

1012
01:44:13,734 --> 01:44:25,034
and I carve out a piece of the firebox and then I'd use that as a shield and I thought yes right right man

1013
01:44:25,112 --> 01:44:29,948
it's so smart a because he got the thing instantly he knew that he knew so

1014
01:44:30,531 --> 01:44:33,590
imagine first of all he thought okay I have to go to the heart of the problem

1015
01:44:34,172 --> 01:44:42,347
right and really to the heart not to the dragon but right down the damn things gullet right to the place where the fire was actually being

1016
01:44:42,371 --> 01:44:50,571
which was actually being created because there it was there you could find the shield and that he'd take this thing that was fireproof and make a shield out of it

1017
01:44:50,595 --> 01:44:59,995
and so that was just dead bloody perfect it was so cool and you think well how could a kid come up with that and there's a bunch of answers I mean one is

1018
01:45:00,019 --> 01:45:04,919
we know snake fear is innate we know that now there's been recent research dedicated that that that

1019
01:45:05,010 --> 01:45:11,158
has demonstrated that okay so and we've been preyed on and been predators for a very long period of time.

1020
01:45:11,158 --> 01:45:13,850
So the idea that, and I found something else

1021
01:45:14,171 --> 01:45:21,347
interesting about the brain out, out about the brain recently too, in a book I was reading by Ray Kurzweil called How to Build a Mind.

1022
01:45:21,347 --> 01:45:22,332
I think that's what it was called.

1023
01:45:22,332 --> 01:45:23,878
It was quite a good book.

1024
01:45:23,878 --> 01:45:28,561
So I think it was in that book, or it was in a neuroscience paper I was reading.

1025
01:45:28,561 --> 01:45:31,175
Doesn't matter, but it was in one of those two places.

1026
01:45:31,175 --> 01:45:36,725
So you know that scanning technology has got more and more high resolution over the last few years, right?

1027
01:45:36,725 --> 01:45:45,487
It just gets more and more high resolution all the time, and so people are now able to look at the microstructures of the brain in a way that hasn't been possible before,

1028
01:45:45,511 --> 01:45:55,511
and so the old idea with the cortex basically was that the cortex was full of a bunch of neurons, and then when one neuron and another fired at the same time, they would wire together.

1029
01:45:55,550 --> 01:45:58,144
And that's kind of how your brain learned to make connections.

1030
01:45:59,150 --> 01:46:01,107
It's a bit more complicated than that, but that will do.

1031
01:46:01,490 --> 01:46:12,988
And then it was found that it wasn't quite that simple, because what your cortex is made out of are these columns of neurons that are duplicated, sort of like a centipede's legs.

1032
01:46:13,630 --> 01:46:18,330
You know, it's very simple genetic code to add another set of legs to a centipede.

1033
01:46:18,652 --> 01:46:21,268
It's sort of like that with your brain, it's made out of all these columns.

1034
01:46:21,670 --> 01:46:25,008
And the columns are basically already quite wired up.

1035
01:46:25,571 --> 01:46:28,048
And then, as you learn, the columns wire together.

1036
01:46:28,712 --> 01:46:33,883
Okay, so there's some pre-existent structure there, but there's more pre-existent structure than that was thought.

1037
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:49,767
So it's basically that there are already tracks that link columns together that are in different parts of the brain, and the columns themselves can send out dendrites to these superhighways,

1038
01:46:50,870 --> 01:46:57,909
which are already there, and then the superhighway is there, and then it can generate connections to the columns at the end of the superhighway.

1039
01:46:57,990 --> 01:47:02,608
So what that means is that there's a tremendous amount of cortical structure already in place,

1040
01:47:03,030 --> 01:47:08,770
there's plasticity around that and when I read that I thought well that's part of the source of the archetypes there's already an archetypal structure there

1041
01:47:09,292 --> 01:47:20,890
that as well as the subcortical structures so you could say that like the kid already had within him not only the capacity to represent not only the monster

1042
01:47:20,914 --> 01:47:28,314
but the class of all possible monsters and the fact that the problem wasn't monsters the problem was that monsters could continually be generated

1043
01:47:28,372 --> 01:47:37,530
which is a way worse problem and then the answer to that isn't to kill an individual monster, the answer to that is go to the source of the monstrous itself and defeat it.

1044
01:47:38,332 --> 01:47:43,530
So it's absolutely staggering and you could imagine that it would take a tremendous amount of meditative effort

1045
01:47:44,132 --> 01:47:47,530
for people to have come up with that solution over a very long period of time.

1046
01:47:48,537 --> 01:47:48,679
So

1047
01:47:49,791 --> 01:48:00,570
now the point of the representation is to formulate a picture of what it is that's the threat, so that you can then formulate a general all-purpose solution.

1048
01:48:01,332 --> 01:48:08,550
And so, there's this image of Callie, which I really like, because Callie is sort of the goddess of the darkness, let's say, and destruction.

1049
01:48:08,590 --> 01:48:18,269
And so Callie is, um, she has a headdress of fire, her hair is on fire, and she has a headdress of skulls, and she has hands cut off all around her neck.

1050
01:48:18,670 --> 01:48:27,550
And she has a belt that's often snakes, but is sometimes, she's sometimes eating the intestines of this guy that she's just given birth to, and that she's sitting on.

1051
01:48:27,690 --> 01:48:34,370
She has eight legs like a spider, and she's in a web of fire, and so she's a monster in some sense that represents

1052
01:48:35,450 --> 01:48:38,462
everything that might terrify and devour you.

1053
01:48:38,462 --> 01:48:40,530
And the question is, so you come up with that

1054
01:48:40,970 --> 01:48:46,250
representation as an image to represent the class of all terrifying things, and then you have to generate a

1055
01:48:46,530 --> 01:48:50,870
solution in the face of that class, and sacrifice is one of the solutions.

1056
01:48:51,332 --> 01:48:55,730
But that heroic encounter is another one of the solutions, and that's the one that he

1057
01:48:56,593 --> 01:49:01,050
catalyzed now he'd been read lots of books he'd watched lots of Disney movies

1058
01:49:01,592 --> 01:49:06,670
you know and and he'd seen the heroic pattern portrayed many many places and

1059
01:49:06,991 --> 01:49:16,407
his little brain was working like mad to extract out the essence of that and to embody it and when I asked him that question it just went snap

1060
01:49:16,431 --> 01:49:26,731
and all those things lined up and his night terrors went away that was it and I followed up with his mum, because it was really quite remarkable, the whole set of occurrences.

1061
01:49:26,770 --> 01:49:31,265
You know, and he didn't have night terrors that night, even though he'd been having them nightly, and that was the end of them.

1062
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:38,083
Because he'd solved his problem, like he needed to be the courageous knight that went after the dragon.

1063
01:49:38,570 --> 01:49:40,562
And so that is what people need to be.

1064
01:49:42,110 --> 01:49:57,250
So I think when we go into solitude, we shut off the external stimulation, and we let the dreaming part of our mind emerge and that's this nonverbal pattern detector

1065
01:49:57,651 --> 01:50:05,267
that thinks in images and it's it's the thing that mediates between what we don't understand and what we do understand

1066
01:50:05,291 --> 01:50:15,891
like if you understand it completely you can say it and you can act it out if you don't understand it you represent it in images and there it's like it's the emotion fear

1067
01:50:15,892 --> 01:50:21,569
withdrawal paralysis and then that manifests itself in an image of what that might be

1068
01:50:21,593 --> 01:50:32,493
and that image is the basis for the story and it's the basis for further development of the idea and to go into isolation is to let those images emerge and to dream a little bit

1069
01:50:32,517 --> 01:50:36,917
and then that moves you that moves you ahead into the future

1070
01:50:36,941 --> 01:50:49,541
so to use your language they use before it's it's not enough just to map out the danger that is imminent in front of you but all the potential dangers that you could come up with in abstract form

1071
01:50:49,570 --> 01:51:02,290
yeah well remember what happens when God throws Adam and Eve out of out of paradise they become aware that they're going to die right the future becomes a problem

1072
01:51:02,314 --> 01:51:09,914
because you could say the future is the place of all potential monsters right and so just the monster that you have right in front of you

1073
01:51:09,938 --> 01:51:16,438
it's like yeah well you get rid of that but that doesn't solve your problem does it the problem is how do you exist in a world full of monsters

1074
01:51:16,462 --> 01:51:20,362
and part of that answer is well you become a monster yourself

1075
01:51:20,414 --> 01:51:21,890
That's a big part of the answer

1076
01:51:22,311 --> 01:51:27,350
But it's an incomplete answer because if you're just a monster then you're just as bad as the monsters

1077
01:51:28,052 --> 01:51:35,450
So you have to trance you have to be a monstrous enough to contend with the monsters But then you have to be civilized enough so that you're not a monster yourself

1078
01:51:35,932 --> 01:51:40,190
And that's more or less equivalent to the union inter integration of the shadow

1079
01:51:41,315 --> 01:51:41,457
so

1080
01:51:42,890 --> 01:51:52,036
Yep, yep.

1081
01:51:52,036 --> 01:51:53,157
Hi, dr. Peterson.

1082
01:51:53,157 --> 01:51:57,480
I've been wanting to ask you this for a while now since I started watching your lectures

1083
01:51:58,621 --> 01:52:02,473
After I started reading a Nietzsche's beyond good and evil.

1084
01:52:02,473 --> 01:52:04,640
I came upon a paragraph in his

1085
01:52:06,061 --> 01:52:09,014
Chapter on scholars that really really bothered me.

1086
01:52:09,014 --> 01:52:10,400
It's actually bothers me to this day

1087
01:52:11,683 --> 01:52:14,740
He talked about this kind of person like they were just a mirror

1088
01:52:15,764 --> 01:52:23,299
like they stretched he said every part of their skin basically to allow every new piece of information that they took on and

1089
01:52:23,323 --> 01:52:32,323
that all they ever were was just an instrument they were just a mirror on reflecting what they had learned never actually having generated anything on their own and it's

1090
01:52:32,347 --> 01:52:42,947
it's bothered me because I feel like in a way it's sort of like it's it's it's impacted my identity a lot because I don't know how are you supposed to create something you

1091
01:52:43,063 --> 01:52:45,650
Okay, well that's okay that that's a really good question.

1092
01:52:45,650 --> 01:52:49,320
I mean Nietzsche is often classed with the existentialists, right?

1093
01:52:49,501 --> 01:52:54,120
And so one of the tenants of existential is there's two real tenants of existentialism

1094
01:52:55,162 --> 01:53:00,060
There's more but obviously we're oversimplifying, but one is that life is a problem

1095
01:53:01,144 --> 01:53:02,940
It isn't because there's something wrong with you

1096
01:53:04,045 --> 01:53:05,420
It's that life is a problem

1097
01:53:06,002 --> 01:53:16,360
And so that's often contrasted with the Freudian view which is that if you have a problem It's because something went wrong during your development the existentialist said no, no, it's like

1098
01:53:17,483 --> 01:53:19,639
life is a problem make no mistake about it and

1099
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:30,330
that the purpose of

1100
01:53:32,492 --> 01:53:36,009
the purpose of scholarship is in some sense to solve that problem and

1101
01:53:37,431 --> 01:53:43,090
so for Nietzsche like he said all truths are bloody truths to me and what he meant by that was that

1102
01:53:44,233 --> 01:53:47,229
if an idea didn't incarnate itself in you and

1103
01:53:47,892 --> 01:53:52,654
transform your perceptions and your actions, then you were merely possessed by the idea.

1104
01:53:52,654 --> 01:53:55,346
You're merely a spokesperson for the idea.

1105
01:53:55,346 --> 01:53:57,574
Or you could say that the idea possessed you.

1106
01:53:57,574 --> 01:53:59,942
You're a puppet for the idea.

1107
01:53:59,942 --> 01:54:00,725
It's not you.

1108
01:54:00,725 --> 01:54:04,439
It's the idea is in you, and it has you.

1109
01:54:04,439 --> 01:54:09,179
You haven't taken the idea and incorporated it with you and made it part of your life.

1110
01:54:09,179 --> 01:54:12,333
And so there's a romanticism that's associated with that, right?

1111
01:54:12,333 --> 01:54:28,226
That's the passionate scholar, the person for whom ideas are not merely... they're not merely what would you call abstracted representations that can be tossed about as if they're commodities.

1112
01:54:28,226 --> 01:54:31,384
They're... they're... they're more like... they're more like personalities.

1113
01:54:31,384 --> 01:54:32,210
That might be another way

1114
01:54:32,511 --> 01:54:33,855
of thinking about it.

1115
01:54:33,855 --> 01:54:38,949
And so if you're... if... if those ideas are compelling, then you

1116
01:54:39,390 --> 01:54:46,394
don't... like one thing I learned a long time ago, and I think this is probably relevant.

1117
01:54:46,394 --> 01:54:50,587
You know, when I was a kid, I liked to argue, and I liked to win arguments or

1118
01:54:51,731 --> 01:54:54,242
lose them, although I liked winning them a lot better.

1119
01:54:54,242 --> 01:54:58,800
But I didn't really mind so much what the content of the argument was.

1120
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:01,810
You know, I could engage in it like a sparring

1121
01:55:02,493 --> 01:55:05,426
match, and it was in some sense to establish dominance, right?

1122
01:55:05,426 --> 01:55:07,132
To establish intellectual dominance.

1123
01:55:07,132 --> 01:55:15,124
I quit doing that when I was in my mid-twenties, because I thought that that That was too shallow an approach to the ideas.

1124
01:55:16,170 --> 01:55:19,524
They're not commodities of that sort.

1125
01:55:21,070 --> 01:55:23,988
They have tendrils that reach down into the living.

1126
01:55:24,250 --> 01:55:25,483
That's the right way to think about it.

1127
01:55:26,110 --> 01:55:31,635
And so Nietzsche's criticism of scholars, and he did this a lot, was that they were bloodless.

1128
01:55:32,390 --> 01:55:32,938
You know, they didn't...

1129
01:55:33,690 --> 01:55:35,748
They were full of performative contradictions.

1130
01:55:35,950 --> 01:55:37,109
That's another way of thinking about it.

1131
01:55:37,170 --> 01:55:42,137
They'd say one thing and do another, because their intellect was completely dissociated from their actions.

1132
01:55:44,011 --> 01:55:46,947
And he thought that was a very bad idea.

1133
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:50,248
And I think that that's a good criticism.

1134
01:55:50,591 --> 01:55:51,670
I think it is a bad idea.

1135
01:55:51,730 --> 01:55:54,766
I also think it makes for an extraordinarily boring lecturer.

1136
01:55:55,470 --> 01:56:02,045
You know, because you can tell if you're listening to someone whether the ideas that you're hearing are merely being passed through the person,

1137
01:56:02,069 --> 01:56:08,669
as if they're being memorized, say, or whether they're part of the dynamic core of the person.

1138
01:56:08,732 --> 01:56:13,210
if they're part of the dynamic core of the person then they're almost always engaging and gripping and

1139
01:56:13,991 --> 01:56:19,330
So he wasn't a fan of bloodless scholars, and I think that's correct because one of the things that I see

1140
01:56:21,393 --> 01:56:23,630
It's not a good idea to have ideas possess you

1141
01:56:25,793 --> 01:56:27,650
Unless you know what the ideas are up to and

1142
01:56:28,491 --> 01:56:36,948
Lots of people are possessed by ideas rather than possessing them and that what that means is they haven't taken the ideas and integrated them into their own being

1143
01:56:37,733 --> 01:56:40,810
They haven't... It's like an incarnation, in a sense.

1144
01:56:40,890 --> 01:56:44,789
They haven't incarnated the ideas in embodied form.

1145
01:56:45,876 --> 01:56:47,488
And so they're incomplete.

1146
01:56:48,352 --> 01:56:52,849
You know, Nietzsche also, thus spake Zarathustra, when Zarathustra comes down the mountain,

1147
01:56:53,391 --> 01:56:58,670
he sees a bunch of people gathered around a famous individual, I think maybe a scholar, but it doesn't really matter.

1148
01:56:59,011 --> 01:57:04,189
And when Zarathustra goes and looks at the person, all he sees is a little tiny midget with a gigantic ear.

1149
01:57:05,255 --> 01:57:07,149
And so he's a hyperspecialist, right?

1150
01:57:07,531 --> 01:57:10,529
And so he has a pretty impressive ear, but he's only this big.

1151
01:57:11,172 --> 01:57:15,590
And that was Nietzsche's imagistic commentary on the danger of hyperspecialization.

1152
01:57:16,152 --> 01:57:19,309
And also on the danger of adulation for hyperspecialization.

1153
01:57:19,912 --> 01:57:22,709
And, and, because he thought about it as a kind of deformity.

1154
01:57:23,694 --> 01:57:26,208
Now, Nietzsche was a pretty harsh guy, but, um...

1155
01:57:29,153 --> 01:57:31,768
But he did address the issue of the relationship between

1156
01:57:32,531 --> 01:57:39,130
intellectual knowledge and and action because for Nietzsche those things are not to be separated in some sense

1157
01:57:40,236 --> 01:57:40,357
so

1158
01:57:41,712 --> 01:57:44,850
Yeah, so maybe I don't know why it maybe it bothered you

1159
01:57:46,551 --> 01:57:51,890
Like it's hard to say why it bothered you it might have bothered you because it sort of undermined the idea of scholar

1160
01:57:52,552 --> 01:58:01,570
But the other possibility and this isn't an accusation because obviously I don't know anything about you But it might also be that it struck a chord you know and that maybe you were doubtful

1161
01:58:02,631 --> 01:58:14,712
questioning how tightly associated your intellectual endeavor was with your actual character and your practice

1162
01:58:14,736 --> 01:58:21,836
so that's another possibility I mean that's a really good thing to think about because generally speaking that integration is it is very much lacking

1163
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:31,260
people are a lot smarter and fluid with their ideas than they are ethical and consistent and characterized by integrity.

1164
01:58:31,312 --> 01:58:42,906
So, yep.

1165
01:58:42,906 --> 01:58:51,290
Hey, so last week you talked about how you hated people asking you if you believe in God or do you believe in miracles or you dislike those questions at least,

1166
01:58:51,314 --> 01:58:57,414
but you also talked about how, and I won't put words in your mouth, but I think you said something about the idea of an empirical evidence

1167
01:58:57,451 --> 01:59:07,270
for religious experiences or spiritual experiences and I wonder how those two ideas, can a spiritual existence or can a spiritual experience exist without God

1168
01:59:07,834 --> 01:59:09,809
Or how did I had who knows?

1169
01:59:11,132 --> 01:59:12,781
Who knows you know?

1170
01:59:12,781 --> 01:59:14,670
I don't know what I don't know what to make of that

1171
01:59:14,951 --> 01:59:18,508
I mean you could it depends on what you're willing to accept as proof.

1172
01:59:18,508 --> 01:59:18,890
I suppose

1173
01:59:19,892 --> 01:59:21,799
That's where things get tricky.

1174
01:59:21,799 --> 01:59:24,549
You know if you have to demonstrate the existence of God

1175
01:59:25,150 --> 01:59:29,230
Objectively then subjective experiences of the transcendent are irrelevant

1176
01:59:30,214 --> 01:59:41,490
And that's a perfectly reasonable standpoint if your initial presupposition is the only thing that has actual existence is those things that can be Demonstrated objectively,

1177
01:59:41,514 --> 01:59:52,214
and I'm not putting that down like that's a powerful methodology Our technology is basically dependent on the acceptance at least the partial acceptance of those axioms

1178
01:59:52,313 --> 02:00:03,329
But I also think that it's difficult for me to to deny the existence of these patterns of thinking that seem to exist cross-culturally

1179
02:00:04,373 --> 02:00:07,650
like the existence of the representation of the dragon, for example

1180
02:00:08,232 --> 02:00:13,710
especially given that I can see an evolutionary rationale for the emergence of these representations

1181
02:00:15,073 --> 02:00:25,730
so, and then there's also the indisputable fact that religious experiences are accessible to people through a number of different avenues

1182
02:00:26,693 --> 02:00:36,068
Now, and one of the things I mentioned when I discussed this before is, well, you could say, well, those are no different than experiences of psychopathology.

1183
02:00:36,710 --> 02:00:45,747
But they are different, because the experiences of psychopathology damage people, whereas the evidence is that the transcendent experiences actually help people.

1184
02:00:46,832 --> 02:00:55,848
So unless you're willing to say, well, there are some forms of psychopathological experience that actually facilitate health, which is a possibility, but you know,

1185
02:00:55,931 --> 02:00:59,829
I think you're pushing your hypothesis at that point.

1186
02:00:59,851 --> 02:01:02,929
Would it hurt to define what a religious experience is in this case, then?

1187
02:01:03,070 --> 02:01:04,949
Because I feel like the semantics...

1188
02:01:05,070 --> 02:01:09,165
Like, I'm not sure what you're saying about a religious experience is what I'm understanding.

1189
02:01:10,490 --> 02:01:15,748
Well generally, a religious experience is something like an experience of the renewal

1190
02:01:16,332 --> 02:01:16,945
of the world.

1191
02:01:17,270 --> 02:01:21,490
might be one way of thinking about it so that everything sort of leaps forward as

1192
02:01:22,250 --> 02:01:27,250
Crystalline and perfect as if you had been viewing it from behind a mask before

1193
02:01:28,212 --> 02:01:31,690
Another would be a sense of the union of everything

1194
02:01:32,771 --> 02:01:37,423
And so you're a singular being and you're isolated and in the religious experiences so for example.

1195
02:01:37,423 --> 02:01:40,050
There's a book written recently by a neuroscientist

1196
02:01:44,494 --> 02:01:44,939
What's it called?

1197
02:01:46,451 --> 02:01:52,910
My stroke of insight yeah, that's right, and I believe she had a left hemisphere stroke if I remember correctly and

1198
02:01:54,074 --> 02:02:03,629
she was a sufficiently well-developed neuroscientist to understand what was happening as she had the stroke and and she had a

1199
02:02:04,391 --> 02:02:07,450
intense religious experience as a consequence of that and

1200
02:02:08,531 --> 02:02:13,890
She experienced it as a dissolution of the ego into this state of union with everything and this

1201
02:02:14,552 --> 02:02:24,890
Transcendent experience of awe and and the open well, I don't remember the rest of it I mean there are other elements of religious experience that are quite common the idea of the opening of the heavens

1202
02:02:25,431 --> 02:02:28,059
That's one the communion with the ancestors.

1203
02:02:28,059 --> 02:02:31,530
That's another the reduction of the body to a skeleton

1204
02:02:32,012 --> 02:02:35,970
That's another the movement up into heaven like these are well-documented

1205
02:02:36,890 --> 02:02:38,890
Phenomena and a lot of them are associated

1206
02:02:39,893 --> 02:02:45,589
Well, a fair number of them are associated with psychedelic use, but that's not the only avenue to experiences like that.

1207
02:02:46,011 --> 02:02:48,487
And epilepsy can produce experiences like that, too.

1208
02:02:49,051 --> 02:02:51,890
And people usually report near-death experiences as well.

1209
02:02:51,990 --> 02:02:57,428
You know, people usually report that those experiences have life-altering significance.

1210
02:02:58,091 --> 02:03:05,509
Now, that in and of itself only proves that people are capable of having subjective religious experiences, right?

1211
02:03:06,452 --> 02:03:10,763
It doesn't definitively prove that there's anything outside of that.

1212
02:03:10,763 --> 02:03:15,301
So Jung, Carl Jung for example, most of the time he didn't talk about God.

1213
02:03:15,301 --> 02:03:16,890
He talked about the God image.

1214
02:03:17,772 --> 02:03:22,110
Which is not the same thing because you could have a God image that was even evolutionarily

1215
02:03:22,690 --> 02:03:30,525
instantiated without that necessarily being related to any transcendent being beyond the image, right?

1216
02:03:30,525 --> 02:03:30,565
So,

1217
02:03:32,574 --> 02:03:33,503
who knows?

1218
02:03:33,503 --> 02:03:33,968
Who knows?

1219
02:03:35,735 --> 02:03:39,889
Again, I think it depends on what you're willing to accept as proof.

1220
02:03:40,431 --> 02:03:47,150
Now, the proof is beyond question that people can have life-changing religious experiences.

1221
02:03:47,632 --> 02:03:52,708
Another example of that is that the best treatment for alcoholism is religious conversion.

1222
02:03:53,472 --> 02:03:56,889
It's well-documented in the literature, and I studied alcoholism for a long time.

1223
02:03:57,351 --> 02:04:01,110
So, one of the cures that sticks is religious conversion.

1224
02:04:01,190 --> 02:04:05,990
conversion and the 12-step programs essentially attempt to instantiate religious conversion and

1225
02:04:07,271 --> 02:04:13,250
It's hard to document their success because they succeed for the people who stick with it, but that's not a very good

1226
02:04:14,233 --> 02:04:16,530
measure right it's sort of it's sort of

1227
02:04:17,610 --> 02:04:19,869
Self-evident that they work for the people who stick with it

1228
02:04:20,512 --> 02:04:25,929
I'm not cynical about about alcoholics anonymous or anything, but we don't have good data on on outcome,

1229
02:04:25,953 --> 02:04:33,253
but But, there is good data showing that religious transformation is a good cure for alcoholism.

1230
02:04:33,294 --> 02:04:35,529
So, and that's an interesting phenomena too.

1231
02:04:36,773 --> 02:04:43,908
Um, it's too complicated, I probably can't.

1232
02:04:47,135 --> 02:04:48,549
Okay, I'll try this for a second.

1233
02:04:48,650 --> 02:04:51,268
So here's how I think a religious conversion might work.

1234
02:04:52,212 --> 02:04:57,349
So imagine you've got the left hemisphere, and it's the place where your habitual interpretations reside.

1235
02:04:58,295 --> 02:05:00,610
So, I can give you a quick example of this.

1236
02:05:00,850 --> 02:05:10,109
So, this guy Ramachandran, who's a neurophysiologist, or I think that's his field of study, I think he's at UCLA,

1237
02:05:10,992 --> 02:05:15,610
he studied people who had neglect, and neglect is a very very bizarre phenomenon.

1238
02:05:16,392 --> 02:05:22,429
So if you have a stroke that damages your right parietal lobe, you'll lose the left part of your being.

1239
02:05:22,871 --> 02:05:28,590
Not just your body, it's really weird, it's like, so for example if you have a right parietal stroke,

1240
02:05:29,132 --> 02:05:34,090
And you look at a clock you only see you only only half the clock exists for you

1241
02:05:34,511 --> 02:05:36,598
It's not like you only see half the clock.

1242
02:05:36,598 --> 02:05:37,621
It's weirder than that.

1243
02:05:37,621 --> 02:05:40,450
It's that there's only the right side of the clock

1244
02:05:40,832 --> 02:05:42,200
There's only the right side of you.

1245
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:44,010
There's only the right side of my body

1246
02:05:44,632 --> 02:05:50,050
I don't know that this exists and so sometimes people with right parietal damage will wake up

1247
02:05:50,631 --> 02:05:56,109
after the stroke and grab their left arm and throw it out of bed and or their leg and throw it out of bed

1248
02:05:56,133 --> 02:06:01,533
Because it's not theirs, and then of course they fall out of bed, which is quite a shock to them, so...

1249
02:06:01,591 --> 02:06:04,842
And so, they'll only eat half the food on the plate.

1250
02:06:04,842 --> 02:06:07,410
Nobody can really understand this phenomenologically, right?

1251
02:06:07,550 --> 02:06:10,078
Because we can't imagine what that must be like.

1252
02:06:10,078 --> 02:06:16,698
I think it must be like, you know how, you know there's things behind you, but you don't not see them.

1253
02:06:16,698 --> 02:06:17,662
They're just not there.

1254
02:06:17,662 --> 02:06:19,990
It's not like it's black or anything, or there's a space.

1255
02:06:20,291 --> 02:06:22,601
It's just not there.

1256
02:06:22,601 --> 02:06:29,468
And so I think what happens is the not there extends to three-quarters of the field instead of half the field.

1257
02:06:29,468 --> 02:06:29,970
That's a guess.

1258
02:06:30,813 --> 02:06:38,050
Anyway, so, Ramesh, now, the funny thing about people with neglect is that if you tell them, if you point it out,

1259
02:06:38,074 --> 02:06:45,274
you say, well, I noticed that you're not moving your left foot today, they'll say, well, it's, it's arthritic, and I can't move it.

1260
02:06:45,371 --> 02:06:47,061
And say, well, why don't you just try to move it?

1261
02:06:49,698 --> 02:06:51,328
It was working fine this morning.

1262
02:06:51,328 --> 02:06:55,628
That can be months after the the accident so it's a denial

1263
02:06:55,652 --> 02:07:03,452
and people thought actually that was trauma induced denial for a long time before they figured it out was actually a consequence of the neuro physiological damage

1264
02:07:03,452 --> 02:07:14,752
now Ramachandran found that if you irrigated the contralateral ear say now if you pour cold water in someone's ear

1265
02:07:14,776 --> 02:07:21,376
it upsets their vestibular system and their eyes will move back and forth like this you can try that at a party if you want and

1266
02:07:21,470 --> 02:07:31,170
And, huh, anyways, Ramachandran was testing vestibular function on these patients, and he irrigated the right ear with cold water, and they woke up.

1267
02:07:31,871 --> 02:07:40,710
And maybe what happened was that that was shocking enough, so imagine the networks in the right hemisphere were degraded but not completely gone.

1268
02:07:41,132 --> 02:07:45,029
And they needed a really high threshold of activation to snap into function.

1269
02:07:45,432 --> 02:07:46,507
So here's an example of that.

1270
02:07:46,951 --> 02:07:49,488
If you have Parkinson's disease, imagine you're frozen there.

1271
02:07:49,991 --> 02:07:53,369
Okay, and I throw a ball at you, you'll go like this, and catch it.

1272
02:07:54,192 --> 02:07:55,527
But you can't throw it back.

1273
02:07:56,611 --> 02:08:02,870
So you can, the stimulus is enough, that's enough to push you past threshold, but you can't do it voluntarily.

1274
02:08:03,071 --> 02:08:07,430
Now, if you have Parkinson's, like, right to the nth degree, you won't even be able to catch it.

1275
02:08:07,551 --> 02:08:09,549
But there's a stage where you can still do that.

1276
02:08:09,831 --> 02:08:19,530
There's a great case study, where this grandpa was in a wheelchair, he had Parkinson's, and his young grandson was playing out on the dock, and fell in the water and started to drown.

1277
02:08:19,851 --> 02:08:28,890
And he got out of his wheelchair, went into the ocean, rescued him, brought him onto the beach, sat back down in his wheelchair, and was paralyzed again.

1278
02:08:29,331 --> 02:08:30,072
So that was enough.

1279
02:08:30,072 --> 02:08:38,570
So you can imagine, there was enough network left, so if the emotional tension became high enough, that the degraded circuits could still function.

1280
02:08:39,231 --> 02:08:41,416
So, okay, so back to Ramachandran.

1281
02:08:41,416 --> 02:08:48,350
So you irrigate the air, all of a sudden the right hemisphere connections flash, the remainders manage to connect.

1282
02:08:48,712 --> 02:08:52,990
And the person goes, Oh my God, I've had a terrible stroke, I've lost the left side of my body.

1283
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:57,689
They're crying, they're, like, completely catastrophically overwhelmed by it.

1284
02:08:58,171 --> 02:09:06,089
And then 20 minutes later, the effects wear off, and they snap back in, and now they've lost their left side again, they don't remember it.

1285
02:09:06,611 --> 02:09:14,349
And so what seems to happen is that the right hemisphere is collecting anomalous information.

1286
02:09:14,771 --> 02:09:15,799
That's what it does.

1287
02:09:15,799 --> 02:09:17,229
That's what it does when you're dreaming.

1288
02:09:17,612 --> 02:09:19,249
it's, it's, it's, it's

1289
02:09:20,190 --> 02:09:28,001
representing that anomalous information in image form and sort of slowly passing it to the left hemisphere so it doesn't overwhelm it.

1290
02:09:28,001 --> 02:09:33,988
And maybe if it gets overwhelming you wake up and you're afraid and you tell someone about the dream, that helps you figure out what it was.

1291
02:09:33,988 --> 02:09:42,045
But anyways, so that the right hemisphere is always trying to tap the left hemisphere into transformation, right?

1292
02:09:42,045 --> 02:09:42,790
So now imagine that

1293
02:09:43,873 --> 02:09:45,989
that can happen a little bit, or a lot.

1294
02:09:47,315 --> 02:09:53,750
so maybe you're just ignoring a little bit of anomalous information you just have some mildly frightening dreams

1295
02:09:53,774 --> 02:10:01,274
or maybe you've just stacked up a whole bunch of things that you're ignoring and there's some major league monsters that you haven't contended with

1296
02:10:01,298 --> 02:10:12,598
maybe there's situations where the right hemisphere is stored up enough counter enough of a counter hypothesis let's say about how the world works

1297
02:10:12,622 --> 02:10:21,522
out make making sense out of all those things that you've ignored that one day it just goes snap and you're a new personality

1298
02:10:21,546 --> 02:10:39,246
and maybe the new personality isn't addicted so it's something like it's something like that I think so yeah okay

1299
02:10:39,270 --> 02:10:50,456
joke good morning citizen Peterson oh god I've prepared a real doozy for you here oh good it's a good thing you've got extra time to handle this one.

1300
02:10:50,456 --> 02:10:55,494
I'd even say it's rehearsed a little bit, so it's going to be ultra ineffective, you know?

1301
02:10:55,494 --> 02:10:57,158
Okay, okay.

1302
02:10:57,158 --> 02:11:04,389
Now, I understand that a lecture on the psychological significance of anything, really,

1303
02:11:04,413 --> 02:11:18,013
is going to indubitably wander off into an anthropocentric world view, but as a practitioner of the hard sciences, I wanted to dig a little bit deeper,

1304
02:11:18,070 --> 02:11:24,262
You know, so I sought out, I guess, a religious interpretation of both creative freedom and

1305
02:11:28,730 --> 02:11:31,462
I guess the very nature of time itself.

1306
02:11:33,572 --> 02:11:35,643
And I found it obviously, that's why I'm here.

1307
02:11:36,990 --> 02:11:44,142
And if you think you have an anthropocentric worldview, it's nothing compared to Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger's, you know.

1308
02:11:45,790 --> 02:11:52,289
Now I like to think that you know this microphone here the one that you keep muting out on me

1309
02:11:52,690 --> 02:11:58,368
you know this microphone is an object which exists outside of our individual perception

1310
02:11:59,050 --> 02:12:00,538
that's just the way I like to look at it.

1311
02:12:03,030 --> 02:12:08,889
But then I think about the concept beauty is in the eye of the beholder and certainly

1312
02:12:09,210 --> 02:12:18,438
I mean when you're talking about art the appreciation of art there has to be some sort of subjective element integrated into that.

1313
02:12:18,438 --> 02:12:21,386
But there also must be a limit as well.

1314
02:12:21,386 --> 02:12:34,526
I mean, certain works of art that we appreciate as absolute masterpieces, like Michelangelo's Pieta, for example, which you bring up frequently, because it really is that good.

1315
02:12:34,526 --> 02:12:42,086
But there's other things which are just, by comparison, they're like vandalism, you know?

1316
02:12:42,086 --> 02:12:43,510
Now, there's always a temptation,

1317
02:12:44,412 --> 02:12:53,259
alright, to invoke the principle of non-overlapping magisteria, but that seems like sort of a cop-out, right?

1318
02:12:53,259 --> 02:13:02,617
So I formulated, I guess for myself, four standards of measure which helped me separate what's the difference between art and mediocrity.

1319
02:13:02,617 --> 02:13:04,300
And here's the four.

1320
02:13:04,300 --> 02:13:07,106
Number one, education.

1321
02:13:07,106 --> 02:13:09,453
Number two, time commitment.

1322
02:13:09,453 --> 02:13:10,559
You got to put in the time.

1323
02:13:10,559 --> 02:13:14,579
If you're an artist, it's probably going to become your full-time occupation.

1324
02:13:14,579 --> 02:13:16,307
It's that, you have to be that passionate about it.

1325
02:13:16,990 --> 02:13:20,181
Number three, public display.

1326
02:13:20,181 --> 02:13:24,537
Art isn't something that you own for yourself, you hide it in your basement, then it's not.

1327
02:13:24,537 --> 02:13:29,314
Art is something which you have to express, you know, something which you've got to share.

1328
02:13:29,314 --> 02:13:37,580
And number four, and I think this is the most important one, efficacy of vision.

1329
02:13:37,580 --> 02:13:42,317
If you're an artist, you've got to have a vision, and we talk about the dream state here a lot.

1330
02:13:42,317 --> 02:13:49,906
You go into the dream state, you have inspiration, but it's not enough to just have the inspiration because that's totally subjective for you.

1331
02:13:49,906 --> 02:14:02,349
The art part about it is having the techniques and the skill and the intent and I guess the capacity to turn that into something real, you know, that you can then express or share.

1332
02:14:02,349 --> 02:14:12,970
So can you read Cardinal Ratzinger's explanation for the nature of time and then address the concept of beauty in the eye of the beholder with specific reference to the

1333
02:14:13,311 --> 02:14:15,862
body positivity movement how

1334
02:14:19,731 --> 02:14:25,653
I don't think I can I think I think I think that's

1335
02:15:14,558 --> 02:15:27,349
I think, I think that you tangled together so many things, and this is also a tangle of things, not that that's a criticism, that I can't pull them all together with sufficient

1336
02:15:27,650 --> 02:15:30,065
rapidity not to bore the audience to death.

1337
02:15:30,810 --> 02:15:33,319
So I'm gonna, I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna wait.

1338
02:15:37,408 --> 02:15:37,530
Okay.

1339
02:15:37,530 --> 02:15:42,410
Mr. Peterson, I'm fascinated by the idea of faith,

1340
02:15:43,255 --> 02:15:44,043
what faith means.

1341
02:15:44,790 --> 02:15:47,567
Jacob listens to a voice and believes it.

1342
02:15:49,531 --> 02:15:51,426
He probably heard other voices.

1343
02:15:52,091 --> 02:15:54,263
Why did he believe this one?

1344
02:15:55,591 --> 02:16:03,850
Why, what, there must have been an a priori sort of functional necessity for him to believe the voice

1345
02:16:04,610 --> 02:16:06,786
that told him one thing or another.

1346
02:16:07,571 --> 02:16:11,450
And I think that that's a string that runs through the Bible and then through the New Testament.

1347
02:16:12,012 --> 02:16:17,410
We are expected as, well, I confess I'm a Christian, I act like I believe God is real.

1348
02:16:18,091 --> 02:16:26,370
And so there is this call of faith and also in every hero's story we see now,

1349
02:16:26,751 --> 02:16:32,010
there is always a moment in that story where the hero must believe something

1350
02:16:32,371 --> 02:16:36,169
beyond the evidence that is before them, which is to say they must take a leap of faith.

1351
02:16:37,032 --> 02:16:42,030
I'm wondering if you can just kind of unpack that experience of faith and the understanding of how a human being

1352
02:16:42,751 --> 02:16:45,784
Makes the choice to believe one thing or another god.

1353
02:16:45,784 --> 02:16:46,969
That's a great question.

1354
02:16:46,969 --> 02:16:47,130
I mean

1355
02:16:48,555 --> 02:16:49,303
Is this still on?

1356
02:16:51,715 --> 02:16:52,503
Is this still working

1357
02:16:53,731 --> 02:16:55,195
Okay, okay good.

1358
02:16:55,195 --> 02:17:00,730
Um, I don't I don't precisely know the answer that it's it's a very peculiar thing because

1359
02:17:01,472 --> 02:17:05,110
We think many things or you could say many voices appear in our minds

1360
02:17:05,812 --> 02:17:15,870
because when Nietzsche took Descartes, I think, therefore I am a part, and he said, well, it isn't so obvious that there's an I, first of all, that it's a unity, like a

1361
02:17:16,954 --> 02:17:26,173
unity transparent unto itself, which of course the psychoanalysts picked up in a big way, and then he wasn't sure that it was the I who thought in some causal manner.

1362
02:17:26,173 --> 02:17:34,810
He said, well, no, it's more like thoughts, it's something like thoughts appear in the phenomenal field, and maybe you choose between them, or maybe they possess you

1363
02:17:34,834 --> 02:17:43,134
like there's lots of other ways of thinking about it it isn't exactly obvious to me why we choose to take one pathway rather than another

1364
02:17:43,213 --> 02:17:48,770
when so many of them offer themselves to us you know people tend to talk about

1365
02:17:49,050 --> 02:18:00,409
that as something like conscience right and now maybe it's that...

1366
02:18:00,433 --> 02:18:13,333
it's got to have something to do I think it's an endless regress because you can always ask why the why any assumption became primary but I'll put that aside for a moment it

1367
02:18:13,350 --> 02:18:25,230
seems to me to have something to do with your aims you know that you're more likely to listen to a voice that is in keeping with your most fundamental aims

1368
02:18:26,214 --> 02:18:33,689
and then the question is where do your most fundamental aims come from and from what I've been able to determine it and I'll speak psychologically again is that

1369
02:18:34,773 --> 02:18:39,690
To begin with, you're a concatenation of rather primitive sub-personalities.

1370
02:18:39,991 --> 02:18:43,424
Hungry ones, tired ones, upset ones, laughing ones.

1371
02:18:43,424 --> 02:18:44,770
You can see that in babies, you know.

1372
02:18:44,830 --> 02:18:46,689
They cycle through those states very rapidly.

1373
02:18:47,031 --> 02:18:52,830
There's an infantile unity above all that, but it doesn't have control, right?

1374
02:18:53,571 --> 02:19:02,830
And so, then the developing individual has to figure out how to integrate those primitive sub-personalities into a unified personality.

1375
02:19:04,295 --> 02:19:09,130
At the same time they integrate the unified personality into a social unity

1376
02:19:10,193 --> 02:19:12,310
So it's partly individual

1377
02:19:13,210 --> 02:19:16,240
Integration, but it's fed by social forces.

1378
02:19:16,240 --> 02:19:19,230
I mean even when you watch an infant breastfeed

1379
02:19:20,572 --> 02:19:24,265
It's established a relationship with its mother, and there's a reciprocity.

1380
02:19:24,265 --> 02:19:25,630
That's already at play there

1381
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:34,610
Underlying multiplicity starts to form itself into a unity and then the question and I would say that's something like

1382
02:19:35,931 --> 02:19:41,650
That's something like the emergence of the the individual out of out of the the titans

1383
02:19:42,252 --> 02:19:46,407
That's a reasonable way of thinking about it like a sovereign out of the titans.

1384
02:19:46,407 --> 02:19:47,150
It's something like that

1385
02:19:48,291 --> 02:19:55,030
But then there's another division which seems to me to parallel parallel that the cain and able division

1386
02:19:55,054 --> 02:20:02,654
It's that that integration can be oriented towards something that's positive, but it can also be oriented towards something that's negative and

1387
02:20:02,693 --> 02:20:07,370
That's the split of the world into good and evil I think and then it looks like you're

1388
02:20:07,650 --> 02:20:12,690
Navigating between those and I can only account for that with something like choice like I think the free choice

1389
02:20:13,713 --> 02:20:15,229
Even though I don't understand it

1390
02:20:16,451 --> 02:20:28,410
I'm unwilling to deny the existence of free choice merely because I don't understand it because it looks to me like like, that's how people act, that's how they expect to be treated, and that societies who...

1391
02:20:29,132 --> 02:20:34,210
that structure themselves in accordance with the idea that people have free choice actually work.

1392
02:20:35,012 --> 02:20:39,030
Now that doesn't prove that there's free choice, but people have been arguing about that forever, so...

1393
02:20:40,172 --> 02:20:44,950
But it looks to me, so those are two possible means of integration, and then I think what you're doing is

1394
02:20:46,572 --> 02:20:48,188
feeding one or the other constantly.

1395
02:20:49,718 --> 02:20:51,930
And I think you probably choose which one to feed

1396
02:20:52,472 --> 02:20:57,530
I think that's and I mean that's how it feels that way to me as well like when I look at my own

1397
02:20:59,852 --> 02:21:02,645
Maybe you're really aggravated with something.

1398
02:21:02,645 --> 02:21:03,810
Maybe you're aggravated with your wife

1399
02:21:04,071 --> 02:21:07,650
you know or or your child or something like that you know and

1400
02:21:08,834 --> 02:21:10,026
you're feeling kind of nasty and

1401
02:21:11,231 --> 02:21:15,930
maybe even know that you're in the wrong and an idea comes into your head you think I could say that and

1402
02:21:17,074 --> 02:21:21,330
And you know you could say it, and you know what it would do, but then you pause and you think

1403
02:21:23,556 --> 02:21:24,610
Would that make it better or worse?

1404
02:21:24,853 --> 02:21:26,289
And then maybe you go to hell with it

1405
02:21:26,811 --> 02:21:33,410
Which is quite the thing to say I've got a little story about that in a minute, and then you say it, but you knew

1406
02:21:34,613 --> 02:21:36,910
You knew that you took the low road, right?

1407
02:21:37,873 --> 02:21:45,650
And you know it, and then you're guilty about that and defensive and that makes the fight way worse because then there's no damn way You're going to admit that you actually did that

1408
02:21:45,674 --> 02:21:51,374
and so things do go to hell and so so here's here's an ugly little idea

1409
02:21:51,451 --> 02:21:58,390
So that's that's that's relevant to the question so imagine you're playing around with cocaine

1410
02:22:00,133 --> 02:22:02,790
Now I'm using cocaine because it's very addictive

1411
02:22:03,071 --> 02:22:06,970
but it's a very interesting chemical because it's a dopaminergic agonist and

1412
02:22:07,692 --> 02:22:12,310
What what dopamine does is two things it makes you feel like what you're doing is worthwhile

1413
02:22:14,471 --> 02:22:23,050
Imagine that there's a bunch of neural circuits that are active And then they get a hit of dopamine or you do then those neural circuits get a little bit more powerful

1414
02:22:24,113 --> 02:22:25,790
Okay, so it it has a rewarding

1415
02:22:26,690 --> 02:22:37,230
Property which is that it makes you feel like what you're doing is important, and it has a reinforcing property Which is it makes neural circuits grow so now what that means is that?

1416
02:22:37,230 --> 02:22:42,569
is that, whatever you were doing just before you took cocaine, grows.

1417
02:22:44,174 --> 02:22:48,509
Okay, so now imagine, there's a bunch of different things that you do just before you take cocaine.

1418
02:22:49,392 --> 02:22:55,850
But there's a string of decisions, and at one decision point, is the same for all of those different occurrences.

1419
02:22:55,910 --> 02:22:58,629
And that decision point is, because you know you're in trouble.

1420
02:22:59,092 --> 02:23:01,429
And that decision point is, well to hell with it.

1421
02:23:03,094 --> 02:23:09,470
Okay, so then you think that each of the 200 times that you take cocaine, even though you do it in different places,

1422
02:23:09,971 --> 02:23:17,450
but that one thought is there all the time, and that thing grows, because you're reinforcing it, and it grows, and it grows, and it grows.

1423
02:23:17,831 --> 02:23:22,630
And so now that's in you, that's part of you, and it's the thing that says to hell with it.

1424
02:23:23,653 --> 02:23:28,329
Okay, so now, and maybe that's not such a good thing to grow inside your brain,

1425
02:23:28,971 --> 02:23:37,070
So then, you're addicted, and they take you to a cocaine treatment centre, and after a week, you're no longer physiologically addicted.

1426
02:23:37,532 --> 02:23:41,288
You're not craving, you don't have a problem, as long as you're there.

1427
02:23:41,851 --> 02:23:46,929
But then they take you back to your normal environment, and you see, like, Cocaine Joe, your friend,

1428
02:23:47,571 --> 02:23:55,649
and as soon as you see him, up that thing comes, and bang, you're back on the to hell with it track.

1429
02:23:56,191 --> 02:24:03,270
And that's where you will end up, too, if you reinforce that particular perspective long enough.

1430
02:24:03,972 --> 02:24:08,129
So, that's akin, in a sense, to this decision-making process, you know?

1431
02:24:08,691 --> 02:24:13,289
If you take the low road, then that wins, and it gets a little stronger.

1432
02:24:13,791 --> 02:24:19,065
Because everything that wins, neurologically, gets a little stronger.

1433
02:24:19,065 --> 02:24:20,529
It's like a Darwinian competition.

1434
02:24:21,051 --> 02:24:24,829
So, one rule is, don't practice what you don't want to become.

1435
02:24:25,151 --> 02:24:27,178
Because you really do become that.

1436
02:24:27,178 --> 02:24:30,490
It builds itself right into your neural architecture.

1437
02:24:31,072 --> 02:24:35,130
And that's one of the terrifying things about addiction, you know, because you think, well, it's kind of psychological.

1438
02:24:37,141 --> 02:24:38,930
It's also kind of neurophysiological.

1439
02:24:39,010 --> 02:24:46,250
And you build a one-eyed cocaine monster in your head, if you hit yourself enough with something that reinforcing.

1440
02:24:55,727 --> 02:24:56,969
Last question, I guess.

1441
02:24:57,911 --> 02:25:07,410
hallelujah just a really simple question then about long-suffering so when it

1442
02:25:07,812 --> 02:25:16,188
one of the things that was noticing from the stories of Jacob and a lot of these biblical narratives is you do have this all-powerful God who's able to kind of

1443
02:25:17,192 --> 02:25:21,090
essentially be the hidden protagonist in the narrative but then the funny thing

1444
02:25:22,276 --> 02:25:31,510
is that he's kind of revealing some of his qualities throughout the course of the story so you were talking about the weird paradox of the fact that God

1445
02:25:31,791 --> 02:25:36,342
somehow allows Jacob Israel to win the fight yeah so my question is relating to

1446
02:25:39,550 --> 02:25:46,715
pants Epps thing about the rats that you told like three or four times and the number of occasions I saw one of your recent videos you talked about it

1447
02:25:46,739 --> 02:25:51,839
where the bigger rat lets the smaller rat win because then the other the smaller rat won't engage in the game.

1448
02:25:51,915 --> 02:25:54,665
So the question is twofold for me.

1449
02:25:54,665 --> 02:26:03,118
One, is God allowing humanity to win periodically so that's to allow us to actually engage in the dialogue through these stories?

1450
02:26:03,118 --> 02:26:05,970
And two, is it a much more primitive version of

1451
02:26:06,271 --> 02:26:15,123
the virtue of humility which you wouldn't normally characterize of an omnipotent deity?

1452
02:26:15,123 --> 02:26:17,569
Well those are excellent questions.

1453
02:26:17,569 --> 02:26:29,648
I really like the second one in particular, that God's decision to allow human victory from time to time is actually a manifestation of something approximating humility, or at least mercy.

1454
02:26:30,290 --> 02:26:32,308
But humility is an interesting take on it.

1455
02:26:32,530 --> 02:26:44,409
Well, it's also connected to Paul's image of how Christ hands himself over and allows himself to be defeated by men and therefore conquers sin, which is man's enemy.

1456
02:26:44,911 --> 02:26:52,525
weird it's the same paradox where God enters into that dynamic with people and loses and willingly loses

1457
02:26:52,549 --> 02:27:05,949
yeah well that's a okay so if the first thing I would say is that that's a really interesting analogy, it's complicated enough questions

1458
02:27:05,973 --> 02:27:14,873
so that I can't go be I don't think I can go beyond the question actually because it's so complicated that I don't think I can formulate it any better than you already did.

1459
02:27:14,925 --> 02:27:16,935
Like it's an interesting string of ideas.

1460
02:27:16,935 --> 02:27:19,184
I'd have to play with it a while to see.

1461
02:27:19,184 --> 02:27:29,909
It does shed an interesting light on why God is amenable to negotiation in the Old Testament, which is really a strange, as you pointed out, it's really a strange thing.

1462
02:27:29,909 --> 02:27:37,402
It's like this is omnipotent God who obviously can do whatever he wants, and yet he can be bargained with.

1463
02:27:37,402 --> 02:27:46,750
And that also opens up the question of Why like your hypothesis is well if you don't let the little rat win now And then then they get dejected and quit playing

1464
02:27:46,774 --> 02:27:54,374
and that's I mean That's that's a pretty good observation if people don't get to win now And then you know they that's kind of what happens to cane

1465
02:27:54,452 --> 02:27:56,601
God says well you're not playing a straight game.

1466
02:27:56,601 --> 02:28:02,036
That's why you're not winning, but I Don't know

1467
02:28:06,239 --> 02:28:15,035
There's an intimation in the Old Testament, and I think it's more developed in the New Testament, maybe not, that the straighter the game you play, the more likely you are to win.

1468
02:28:16,770 --> 02:28:25,844
And so, maybe part of the reason that God lets Abraham bargain and even Jacob is because they've started to play very straight games.

1469
02:28:26,890 --> 02:28:30,085
And so maybe you do win in your wrestling with God if you play a straight game.

1470
02:28:31,330 --> 02:28:38,607
I mean, I think that's, I actually think that's, I think the reason that's true is because that's actually why we would define it as a straight game.

1471
02:28:39,171 --> 02:28:41,328
Now, then we could speak psychologically again.

1472
02:28:41,811 --> 02:28:45,689
I think that what we've come to recognize as a straight game

1473
02:28:46,311 --> 02:28:49,868
is the game that in the broadest number of situations across

1474
02:28:50,471 --> 02:28:55,109
the widest range of time spans, is most likely to produce a positive outcome.

1475
02:28:55,531 --> 02:28:59,888
And that's, that's actually the grounds for our sense of ethics, that it's really practical.

1476
02:29:00,671 --> 02:29:05,989
Not to belabour it too much, because there was an interesting insight from Chesterton's The Man Who Was Thursday,

1477
02:29:06,411 --> 02:29:12,849
where God sets himself up as the benevolent antagonist, so as to accelerate the game.

1478
02:29:14,472 --> 02:29:17,170
Yeah, well, I think that's a really interesting idea.

1479
02:29:17,250 --> 02:29:26,890
I mean, there is hints, I would say, throughout the biblical stories, that the reason that God tolerates Satan, let's say,

1480
02:29:27,151 --> 02:29:37,251
because without an adversary you're soft and that's I mean that's tied in with the notion that life is something like a moral struggle

1481
02:29:37,275 --> 02:29:46,075
you know that that's the fundamental essence of being a moral struggle now it I think that that's phenomenologically a reasonable observation

1482
02:29:46,099 --> 02:29:53,499
maybe other people don't experience it that way but it seems to me like within my own experience that that's accurate

1483
02:29:53,523 --> 02:29:57,723
now I don't know what again I don't know what that says about the fundamental nature of reality

1484
02:29:57,747 --> 02:30:07,747
but I had a vision at one point that I was in a ring with Satan actually believe it or not and it was

1485
02:30:07,770 --> 02:30:22,516
like a Roman Colosseum and you know I was rather upset to find myself there but I won and I asked God afterwards why he would do such a thing and his answer was

1486
02:30:23,835 --> 02:30:24,623
He knew I could win

1487
02:30:25,692 --> 02:30:26,576
That's interesting.

1488
02:30:26,576 --> 02:30:32,530
You know because like I don't know what to make of that believe me I have no idea what to make of that, but the idea was that

1489
02:30:34,135 --> 02:30:35,890
If you're trying to encourage someone

1490
02:30:37,391 --> 02:30:47,370
Rather than protect them because those are really different things right to protect someone isn't to make them strong to encourage them is to make Them strong then you set them a series of challenges

1491
02:30:48,954 --> 02:30:49,238
right

1492
02:30:50,613 --> 02:30:52,969
right at the point where they may win and

1493
02:30:54,312 --> 02:30:59,874
Maybe you could make a case that that's what you do if you really care for someone now I know that that's it.

1494
02:30:59,874 --> 02:31:03,023
I'm not saying that that interpretation is correct.

1495
02:31:03,023 --> 02:31:05,389
I'm not I'm not but but there's something I

1496
02:31:06,511 --> 02:31:08,437
Mean you definitely with your children.

1497
02:31:08,437 --> 02:31:12,510
You know when you're wrestling with them say when you're playing with them you use

1498
02:31:14,694 --> 02:31:16,710
You push them to the limit of their ability

1499
02:31:18,013 --> 02:31:20,810
Because otherwise they don't transcend their current abilities

1500
02:31:22,234 --> 02:31:22,416
so

1501
02:31:25,791 --> 02:31:40,870
Yep, so we'll see some of you

1502
02:31:41,732 --> 02:31:50,670
Perhaps most of you in December And I think we'll finish off Genesis at that point and then in the new year probably not till the spring

1503
02:31:51,632 --> 02:31:59,770
I'll start with Exodus, which I'm really looking forward to because I really like the Exodus story It's an amazing story and unbelievably deep

1504
02:31:59,794 --> 02:32:08,794
not well the ones we've covered so far been you know pretty good as well But so thank you all for coming and we'll perhaps see you in about a month

1505
02:32:08,818 --> 02:32:22,929
好吧 上次我来这里的时候 你们中的许多人也是如此 我们已经讲完了雅各的故事 从那时起我就一直在零星地挖掘这个故事

1506
02:32:22,953 --> 02:32:29,753
试图找出可以展开的其他主题 我认为有一些非常有趣的东西可以谈论

1507
02:32:29,829 --> 02:32:31,970
那么我们就开始吧

1508
02:32:33,960 --> 02:32:35,490
所以我要先回顾一下

1509
02:32:37,032 --> 02:32:48,570
所以我们正在谈论雅各 我将稍微更新一下他的传记 以便我们可以在继续之前将自己置于正确的背景中

1510
02:32:49,551 --> 02:32:56,248
他的母亲利百加生下了双胞胎 而这对双胞胎甚至在她的子宫里也在为健康而斗争

1511
02:32:56,970 --> 02:33:01,010
他们正在斗争 当然是他们正在为年长者的统治地位而斗争

1512
02:33:01,874 --> 02:33:05,830
或者（也可以说是）年轻人反对年长的人 因雅各意味着篡位者

1513
02:33:06,813 --> 02:33:12,730
利百加有一个来自上帝的异象 你称之为什么

1514
02:33:13,912 --> 02:33:27,121
雅各将取代以扫 所以甚至在她的双胞胎出生之前 他们就处于竞争状态 这就是敌对兄弟母题的重演 对吗

1515
02:33:27,121 --> 02:33:35,521
这是一个非常非常常见的神话主题 我们已经在该隐和亚伯的故事中看到了这一点 对吧

1516
02:33:35,545 --> 02:33:42,745
该隐和亚伯本质上是最早的两个人类 最初的两个天生的人类 他们立即陷入了敌对状态

1517
02:33:42,769 --> 02:33:55,569
这首先象征着人们心灵中存在的敌意 你可能会说 他们的目标是光明

1518
02:33:55,593 --> 02:34:00,493
而另一帮人的目标是黑暗 我认为这是描绘它的合理方式

1519
02:34:00,497 --> 02:34:08,290
显然 这是一种充满象征意义的方式 但我对人们的经历

1520
02:34:09,331 --> 02:34:19,210
特别是当你认真地了解他们或者当他们正在处理严重的问题时 你会发现他们中显然有一部分人正在努力在世界上做好事 甚至做“善”事

1521
02:34:19,234 --> 02:34:26,234
另一部分则是极度愤世嫉俗和怨恨的 它说让它见鬼去吧 并且是自我毁灭的

1522
02:34:26,332 --> 02:34:30,310
猛烈抨击（一切）的 真正的目的是让事情变得更糟

1523
02:34:32,933 --> 02:34:35,830
所以这似乎是人类心理的自然组成部分

1524
02:34:36,891 --> 02:34:42,870
这也反映在“堕落”的思想中 因此这些思想​​不会轻易被抛弃

1525
02:34:43,511 --> 02:34:50,150
它们与伊甸园故事中自我意识的兴起有关 我认为这是正确的 因为我

1526
02:34:51,334 --> 02:34:55,450
我确实认为我们的自我意识在我们内部产生了这种分裂 因为

1527
02:34:56,434 --> 02:35:05,890
我们比任何其他生物都更强烈地意识到我们的有限性和痛苦 这往往会使我们至少在某种程度上反对存在本身

1528
02:35:06,795 --> 02:35:14,570
我上周在美国看到一群抗议者对着天空尖叫

1529
02:35:15,594 --> 02:35:17,249
关于特朗普

1530
02:35:17,892 --> 02:35:23,130
这很有趣 就像我认为这是一种非常自恋的表现

1531
02:35:23,891 --> 02:35:28,525
但尽管如此 它还是有一些象征意义的

1532
02:35:28,525 --> 02:35:33,845
还有一部电影我非常喜欢 可悲的是叫《FUBAR》

1533
02:35:33,845 --> 02:35:35,130
不知道你们有多少人看过

1534
02:35:38,391 --> 02:35:47,775
是的 那部电影是 它是关于和我一起长大的人的 所以是的 这是真的 我告诉你那是真的

1535
02:35:47,775 --> 02:35:53,330
所以《FUBAR》中的男主角很聪明 但完全不文明

1536
02:35:54,511 --> 02:36:01,546
他得了睾丸癌 有一个很棒的场景 他喝得太醉了 他在街上跌跌撞撞

1537
02:36:02,131 --> 02:36:12,130
几乎处于昏迷状态 当然他对发生在他身上的事情不是很兴奋 他对着天空挥舞着拳头 倾盆大雨 他咒骂上帝 这就像

1538
02:36:12,431 --> 02:36:18,970
好的 你可以理解他的立场 所以这让我想起了（刚才说的）那些（为了特朗普而）对着天空大喊大叫的人

1539
02:36:18,994 --> 02:36:27,694
他们基本上是在戏剧化这个思想 他们很生气 你可以说 上帝 当然他们中的大多数人不会这么说 但是

1540
02:36:27,773 --> 02:36:29,850
但他们是那种对着该死的天空大喊大叫的人

1541
02:36:30,111 --> 02:36:35,830
我的意思是 所以你看到了他们做了什么而不是他们说了什么 他们很愤怒

1542
02:36:36,131 --> 02:36:41,550
这个存在的构造使得特朗普可以成为总统 所以

1543
02:36:42,851 --> 02:36:53,749
嗯 所以这个思想 我们可以很容易地反对“存在”并为它的毁灭而努力 这是一个非常非常普遍的主题 它永远不会消失

1544
02:36:54,230 --> 02:37:03,130
你会看到它在像新的漫威系列这样的故事中得到呼应 例如 你看到雷神和洛基之间的敌意 这是同一件事的一个很好的例子

1545
02:37:03,270 --> 02:37:15,409
或者在蝙蝠侠和小丑之间 或者超人和莱克斯卢瑟之间 这些英雄对恶棍 这是一个非常戏剧性和容易的

1546
02:37:16,573 --> 02:37:19,230
大家都能理解这种动力吧

1547
02:37:19,370 --> 02:37:29,370
这是一个基本情节 之所以是基本情节 是因为它是我们的精神之战的真实写照 是我们个人的精神之战的真实写照 是家庭的真实写照

1548
02:37:29,394 --> 02:37:32,894
因为兄弟姐妹之间的竞争可能异常残酷

1549
02:37:32,914 --> 02:37:41,508
这在陌生人之间是真实的 在人群之间也是如此 就像在每个分析层面上都是如此 在某种意义上也是如此

1550
02:37:41,508 --> 02:37:43,881
这是典型的真实

1551
02:37:45,232 --> 02:37:51,070
至少在深刻的宗教象征意义方面 因为你在许多故事中也看到了这一点的呼应

1552
02:37:51,094 --> 02:37:58,194
所以我认为最清晰的代表可能是基督和撒旦 尽管它最接近纯粹的原型

1553
02:37:58,293 --> 02:38:06,770
古埃及故事中有奥西里斯和塞特或荷鲁斯和塞特 塞特是撒旦的前身

1554
02:38:07,770 --> 02:38:20,727
从词源学上来说 这是一个非常非常常见的主题 这就是利百加子宫里再次发生的事情 这个思想立即发挥出来 两个双胞胎实际上是

1555
02:38:21,754 --> 02:38:22,663
你在那里管它叫什么

1556
02:38:24,175 --> 02:38:27,408
他们拥有至高无上的命运 因为

1557
02:38:28,874 --> 02:38:35,989
其中一位注定要成为以色列的父亲 当然 这是旧约的巅峰时刻

1558
02:38:36,551 --> 02:38:40,797
显然 这可以说是人类历史上的巅峰时刻

1559
02:38:40,797 --> 02:38:48,550
现在 《旧约》中的故事实际上在多大程度上构成了我们所认为的经验历史 这是一个有争议的问题

1560
02:38:49,311 --> 02:39:02,142
但从某种意义上说 这并不重要 因为正如我之前在系列讲座中提到的 你知道 有些形式的小说是元真实的

1561
02:39:02,166 --> 02:39:10,066
这意味着它们不一定是关于某个具体的个人 尽管我通常认为它们是基于具体个人的生活

1562
02:39:10,142 --> 02:39:12,530
这是最简单的理论 但谁知道呢 对吧

1563
02:39:13,392 --> 02:39:22,630
但它们比现实本身更真实 因为它们抽象出现实中最相关的元素并将其呈现给您

1564
02:39:22,991 --> 02:39:27,590
这就是为什么你看小说 你不希望你的小说被简化 对吧

1565
02:39:28,415 --> 02:39:29,910
你要把问题归结到本质上来

1566
02:39:30,030 --> 02:39:36,250
这就是优秀小说的精髓 其本质比普通的真理更真实

1567
02:39:37,053 --> 02:39:50,450
如果处理得好 那么你就会知道 如果你看莎士比亚戏剧 半辈子的事情都可能在莎士比亚的戏剧中发生 它涵盖了广泛的场景等等

1568
02:39:51,715 --> 02:40:02,790
所以它是同时被剪切、编辑和压缩的 但正因为如此 它用一种情感和道德的力量来震撼你

1569
02:40:03,510 --> 02:40:08,970
是单纯的日常生活录像所无法比拟的 而更像一种近似

1570
02:40:09,957 --> 02:40:10,120
所以

1571
02:40:11,132 --> 02:40:13,020
还有敌对兄弟的这个主题

1572
02:40:13,020 --> 02:40:19,067
这是一个深刻的原型真理

1573
02:40:22,516 --> 02:40:32,178
神对拉结说 两个国家在你腹中 两种人将从你的腹中分离出来 一个人比另一个人更强大 年长的要侍奉年幼的

1574
02:40:32,950 --> 02:40:47,654
因此 这里存在一个倒置 因为正如我们所讨论的 从历史角度和传统角度来看 长子往往会获得绝大多数的祝福

1575
02:40:49,830 --> 02:41:04,830
这也有一定的道理 从经验上看 随着家庭中孩子数量的增加 越年幼的智商往往会越低 一般来说 最年长的人最聪明

1576
02:41:04,854 --> 02:41:17,754
目前还不清楚为什么会这样 但可能是他们得到了更多的关注 但谁知道呢 所以你们这些年幼的人可能会对这个事实感到非常不满 现在雅各好吧 所以还有另一个

1577
02:41:17,834 --> 02:41:29,366
这里还有另一条情节线 因为亚伯拉罕和利百加不和

1578
02:41:30,212 --> 02:41:38,346
很抱歉以撒和利百加在孩子们的问题上存在分歧 所以这也有一个恋母情结 因为

1579
02:41:39,331 --> 02:41:49,030
好吧 以撒与以扫结盟 而以扫是个猎人 所以他是个粗犷的角色 你知道 他长得有点野性

1580
02:41:49,871 --> 02:41:51,819
毛茸茸的 他喜欢在野外

1581
02:41:51,819 --> 02:41:52,622
他住在帐篷里

1582
02:41:52,622 --> 02:41:53,365
他喜欢打猎

1583
02:41:53,365 --> 02:41:54,510
他是一个男人中的男人

1584
02:41:54,691 --> 02:41:56,336
这是一种思想

1585
02:41:56,336 --> 02:41:58,423
而雅各则住在帐篷里

1586
02:41:58,423 --> 02:41:59,768
他很少出门

1587
02:41:59,768 --> 02:42:00,169
他更...

1588
02:42:01,252 --> 02:42:03,807
嗯 也许他比较内向 但他确实是这样的孩子

1589
02:42:04,970 --> 02:42:10,230
是个青少年 他在家里闲逛 有迹象表明他是他的母亲……

1590
02:42:10,370 --> 02:42:16,750
嗯 他显然是他母亲的最爱 有所有的优点 我想也有随之而来的缺点

1591
02:42:18,352 --> 02:42:34,683
以撒和利百加对于谁应该在儿子们中占据主导地位的问题意见不一 利百加与雅各串通一气 颠覆了社会秩序 所以首先发生的事情是这样的

1592
02:42:34,683 --> 02:42:43,150
奇怪的是 以扫打猎回来了 他可能已经出去好几天了

1593
02:42:43,630 --> 02:42:49,150
他很贪婪 而且是一个有点冲动的人 似乎并没有真正考虑长远的问题

1594
02:42:50,452 --> 02:42:52,429
雅各正在煮扁豆汤

1595
02:42:54,811 --> 02:43:02,466
以扫想要一些 雅各拒绝了 然后说让以扫用他与生俱来的权利来换取它

1596
02:43:05,132 --> 02:43:08,547
以扫同意了 这是一个糟糕的交易 对吗

1597
02:43:08,547 --> 02:43:09,350
这是一笔糟糕的交易

1598
02:43:10,333 --> 02:43:15,150
所以你可以说 以扫实际上是罪有应得

1599
02:43:18,012 --> 02:43:21,524
至少你必须认为他们俩都有同样的罪责

1600
02:43:21,524 --> 02:43:25,647
这是一个令人讨厌的把戏 所以这是雅各的第一个把戏

1601
02:43:27,934 --> 02:43:34,909
那么第二个技巧是 随着时间的推移 以撒变得又老又瞎

1602
02:43:35,975 --> 02:43:37,045
接近死亡

1603
02:43:37,751 --> 02:43:41,109
现在是他为儿子们祝福的时候了

1604
02:43:41,652 --> 02:43:44,709
显然 对于这些古代人来说 这是一个非常重要的事件

1605
02:43:47,371 --> 02:43:53,269
以扫又出去打猎了 拉结给雅各穿上了毛茸茸的……

1606
02:43:54,011 --> 02:44:00,509
把一张山羊皮放在他的手臂上 所以他有点像以扫一样的毛茸茸的 给他穿上以扫的衣服 所以他闻起来像以扫 而且……

1607
02:44:02,393 --> 02:44:11,289
以撒告诉以扫出去给他猎取一些鹿肉 我想是的 这是他最喜欢的

1608
02:44:11,750 --> 02:44:20,369
利百加让雅各煮了几个小山羊 然后把它们端给以撒 并扮演以扫的角色

1609
02:44:20,690 --> 02:44:22,136
所以他就这么做了

1610
02:44:22,136 --> 02:44:25,088
考虑到所有事情 这真的非常令人讨厌

1611
02:44:25,750 --> 02:44:32,548
对你的兄弟和你失明的父亲玩这样的把戏 并与你的母亲勾结

1612
02:44:32,871 --> 02:44:36,929
这并不是真正旨在促进家庭和谐的事情

1613
02:44:37,672 --> 02:44:45,448
所以 特别是因为你已经把他整惨了一次 你知道 你会觉得 你会觉得这就足够了

1614
02:44:46,232 --> 02:44:55,190
所以 无论如何 他是成功的 而以扫失去了父亲的祝福 所以雅各最终真正处于长子的位置

1615
02:44:55,290 --> 02:45:01,410
这很有趣 因为上帝告诉拉结 雅各将成为双胞胎中的主导者

1616
02:45:01,434 --> 02:45:08,234
你会再次想到上帝的祝福 或者至少是雅各最终会成为一个好人的预言

1617
02:45:08,291 --> 02:45:14,369
但他肯定不是一开始就以这种方式呈现的 这也很有趣 因为他是以色列的最终创始人

1618
02:45:15,051 --> 02:45:26,004
这是的这些古老故事的现实主义的另一个迹象 这对我来说非常令人惊讶 对我来说 这些故事仍然如此未经预测 一直让我感到非常惊讶

1619
02:45:26,004 --> 02:45:27,470
因为你会认为

1620
02:45:28,392 --> 02:45:38,710
如果你有一点点愤世嫉俗 特别是如果你有马克思主义有关“宗教是大众鸦片”的观点 这是一个可信的观点 尽管它是错误的

1621
02:45:39,071 --> 02:45:51,349
我认为这是一个肤浅的解释 我认为这是一个肤浅的解释的部分原因是 因为如果是这样的话 （这些宗教）故事应该被写得漂亮些

1622
02:45:51,349 --> 02:45:58,069
（那么）这些角色不会有这种奇怪的、现实的、道德上的模糊性

1623
02:45:58,490 --> 02:46:07,067
你知道 如果你要给人们灌输一种幻想 那么你希望它像哈莱金小说或贺卡之类的东西

1624
02:46:07,550 --> 02:46:13,867
你不希望这是一个充满背叛、欺骗、谋杀、混乱和种族灭绝等等的故事

1625
02:46:14,130 --> 02:46:19,455
我想 这似乎不是一个正确的答案

1626
02:46:20,950 --> 02:46:29,308
无论如何 雅各侥幸逃脱了惩罚 但以扫并不高兴 雅各确信他可能会杀了他

1627
02:46:29,390 --> 02:46:36,648
我认为这是一种合理的恐惧 因为以扫是一个硬汉 他习惯在外面 他知道如何打猎 他知道如何杀人

1628
02:46:36,672 --> 02:46:44,572
事实上 他并不是很高兴被他的呆在家里的弟弟狠狠地整了两次

1629
02:46:44,590 --> 02:46:48,008
于是雅各就跑去拜访他的叔叔了

1630
02:46:48,430 --> 02:46:54,988
在路上 这是故事中非常有趣的部分 他停下来睡觉 然后

1631
02:46:55,530 --> 02:47:00,969
他拿一块石头当枕头 然后他有了这个幻象 这就是梦 但是

1632
02:47:01,390 --> 02:47:11,346
上下文使它看起来像一个异象 一架梯子通向天堂 天使在梯子上上下移动 可以这么说

1633
02:47:12,211 --> 02:47:18,850
有一些关于这一点的表述 上次我们讨论时 我向你们展示了其中一些 但我会先读给你们听

1634
02:47:46,190 --> 02:47:55,670
你的后裔和你的后裔要像地上的尘土一样 现在要向西向东 向北向南传播 这样就正确地确定了方向

1635
02:47:55,694 --> 02:47:57,694
所以 现在有了一个中心 它有一个标准方向 就像你在地图上看到的那个小符号一样

1636
02:48:02,311 --> 02:48:14,461
这也是象征性地放置在地球上的东西 因此已经建立了一个中心 并从中心辐射出方向线

1637
02:48:14,461 --> 02:48:17,648
所以它作为一处地方而被设立

1638
02:48:18,573 --> 02:48:21,790
最后 我看到地上的万家都将蒙福

1639
02:48:21,834 --> 02:48:23,430
这对雅各来说是个好消息

1640
02:48:23,490 --> 02:48:28,590
至于上帝为什么要奖励他--因为他在坑害了自己的兄弟之后逃跑了--这也不是一目了然的

1641
02:48:28,771 --> 02:48:31,004
但事情似乎就是这样

1642
02:48:31,004 --> 02:48:34,990
这里有几个典型的阐述

1643
02:48:36,353 --> 02:48:37,963
右边的是威廉·布莱克

1644
02:48:37,963 --> 02:48:39,130
是我特别喜欢的一位

1645
02:48:39,190 --> 02:48:46,348
布莱克将上帝与太阳和光同化 对吧

1646
02:48:47,350 --> 02:48:54,034
所以这是一个相当常见的神话观念 即上帝与光和白昼有关

1647
02:48:59,642 --> 02:49:04,266
看啊 我与你同在 无论你去往何处 我都会保护你 并带你再次回到这片土地

1648
02:49:04,590 --> 02:49:08,288
因为我不会离开你 除非我完成了我对你所说的事情

1649
02:49:08,710 --> 02:49:17,310
雅各从睡梦中醒来 他说 主确实在这里 我不知道 他很害怕--这正是正确的反应--

1650
02:49:17,334 --> 02:49:27,634
并说这个地方是多么可怕 它不是别处 正是上帝的殿 这是天堂之门 雅各清早起床 拿起他当作枕头上的石头

1651
02:49:27,658 --> 02:49:36,458
把它立为一根柱子 在上面倒上油 这比你想象的更重要 我们会更深入地讨论这一点 因为

1652
02:49:36,482 --> 02:49:43,982
到目前为止 故事中还没有任何东西真正出现来标记一个神圣的空间 对吧

1653
02:49:44,006 --> 02:49:47,706
没有 没有大教堂 没有教堂 没有那样的东西

1654
02:49:47,706 --> 02:49:55,706
但出现了这样的思想：你可以标记某个重要事物的中心 然后用一块石头来标记它

1655
02:49:55,795 --> 02:50:04,290
石头是标记重要事物的好方法 因为石头是永久的权利 我们现在用石头标记事物 就像我们用石头标记坟墓一样

1656
02:50:04,314 --> 02:50:10,614
因为我们想要创造一段记忆 在石头上雕刻一些东西 而在石头上雕刻一些东西就是创造记忆

1657
02:50:10,672 --> 02:50:18,950
使用石头就是创造记忆 因为石头是永久的 而正确地摆放石头则是为了表明一个中心

1658
02:50:18,974 --> 02:50:29,074
这就是发生的事情 并将油倒在上面 这是一种祭品 他给那个地方起名叫伯特利 但这座城市的名字最初被称为路斯

1659
02:50:29,098 --> 02:50:47,125
雅各许愿说 如果上帝与我同在 在我所走的路上保佑我 给我食物吃 衣服穿 那么我就把我挣来的十分之一给他

1660
02:50:47,125 --> 02:50:49,389
我错过了

1661
02:50:49,389 --> 02:50:53,144
这也很有趣 因为现在牺牲发生了转变 对吗

1662
02:50:53,144 --> 02:50:58,046
因为在那之前 牺牲已经相当具体了

1663
02:50:58,046 --> 02:50:59,752
那是某种东西在燃烧

1664
02:50:59,752 --> 02:51:10,008
而在这里 突然间 它变成了生产劳动本身的提供 就像什一税一样 因为什一税是一种牺牲形式

1665
02:51:10,008 --> 02:51:12,439
因此 牺牲的概念是抽象的

1666
02:51:12,439 --> 02:51:24,767
现在 牺牲 将牺牲的概念抽象化非常重要 对吧 因为它应该抽象到我们今天使用它的方式 即

1667
02:51:24,791 --> 02:51:36,395
我们为了取得成功而做出牺牲 每个人都明白这意味着什么 但这些牺牲通常是心理和现实的结合

1668
02:51:36,395 --> 02:51:37,760
所以我们不会把它们表现出来

1669
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:41,575
准确地说 我们并没有将它们戏剧化或仪式化

1670
02:51:41,575 --> 02:51:45,716
我们实际上在我们与未来订立的契约中践行了它们

1671
02:51:45,716 --> 02:51:53,270
我们会这样做--除非我们在生活中非常冲动和漫无目的 并且对未来没有任何概念

1672
02:51:53,672 --> 02:52:02,284
并且很可能会为了现在而牺牲未来 这就是以扫所做的 对吧--否则我们就会做出牺牲

1673
02:52:02,284 --> 02:52:09,550
你必须想 为了让未来变得更美好而做出牺牲的思想是一个非常难以学习的教训

1674
02:52:09,574 --> 02:52:18,574
天知道人们花了多长时间才知道 就像我们知道这不是动物能轻易做到的事情一样

1675
02:52:18,598 --> 02:52:26,998
黑猩猩不会储存剩下的肉  它们不会储存剩余的肉 狼也不会 狼一次可以吃掉大约30磅的肉

1676
02:52:27,022 --> 02:52:37,622
这就是狼吞虎咽的思想的来源 因为他们不会隐藏它 为以后保存它 他们不能这样做 所以他们不能为了未来而牺牲现在

1677
02:52:37,712 --> 02:52:40,024
因此 发生这种情况是一件大事

1678
02:52:41,230 --> 02:52:56,602
现在我想告诉你们一些关于支柱的思想 因为这是一个令人难以置信的深刻思想 它以我们仍然不理解的方式引导我们

1679
02:52:56,690 --> 02:53:00,225
事实上 它实际上是我们定向的机制

1680
02:53:01,410 --> 02:53:04,006
如果缺乏它 我们就会迷失方向

1681
02:53:04,610 --> 02:53:06,988
因此 我将向您展示一些图片并首先描述它们

1682
02:53:07,431 --> 02:53:10,326
好吧 首先 有一座有城墙的城市

1683
02:53:11,050 --> 02:53:15,608
所以让我告诉你 你可以将其视为一个典型的人类居住地

1684
02:53:16,210 --> 02:53:21,747
也许是平原或森林中的火之类的东西的反射

1685
02:53:22,650 --> 02:53:25,463
或者丛林 尽管那里很难生火

1686
02:53:26,990 --> 02:53:31,710
火周围环绕着原木 也许周围环绕着住宅 对吗

1687
02:53:31,790 --> 02:53:38,976
所以火在中心 火定义了中心 然后当你远离火时 你就进入了黑暗 对吗

1688
02:53:38,976 --> 02:53:49,150
因此 火是光、交流和安全 当你远离火时 你就会进入黑暗和边界之外的可怕事物

1689
02:53:49,291 --> 02:53:51,339
所以 边界之外的东西是可怕的

1690
02:53:51,339 --> 02:53:53,869
如果你去野外露营 你就会有这种感觉

1691
02:53:54,231 --> 02:53:56,769
你非常高兴--尤其是当狼嚎叫的时候--

1692
02:53:57,071 --> 02:54:01,449
你非常高兴坐在火边 因为你可以看到

1693
02:54:01,831 --> 02:54:12,749
火可以让动物远离 而且 如果你真的走进灌木丛、走进黑暗 那么你就处于戒备状态 你的捕食者探测系统也处于戒备状态

1694
02:54:13,191 --> 02:54:21,769
所以你可以把经典的人类居住地想象成两个地方 一个地方是你的捕食者检测系统没有处于警戒状态

1695
02:54:22,251 --> 02:54:26,049
另一个是你的捕食者检测系统处于警戒状态

1696
02:54:26,451 --> 02:54:32,670
您可以将其大致视为已探索领域和未探索领域之间的区别

1697
02:54:33,131 --> 02:54:39,849
事实上 一个地方的建立正是如此 这是我从阅读 Mircea Eliade 中得到的很多内容

1698
02:54:40,411 --> 02:54:48,729
一个地方的建立正是对一个已探索的中心的定义 它与未探索的边缘相对应

1699
02:54:49,331 --> 02:54:54,130
而且 这有什么有趣的 所以你可以思考一下关于城墙的城市 对吗

1700
02:54:54,451 --> 02:54:59,949
墙内万物皆宇宙 墙外万物皆混沌

1701
02:55:01,171 --> 02:55:09,070
而且 它也延伸到概念领域 因为想象你是某个研究领域的大师

1702
02:55:09,771 --> 02:55:14,269
所以 这是一个有趣的隐喻 因为领域是一个地理隐喻 对吧

1703
02:55:14,871 --> 02:55:23,889
而且 如果这个领域的中心是每个人都非常了解的事情 那么每个人都在该领域遵守的公理

1704
02:55:24,311 --> 02:55:30,809
然后 当你走向边缘时 你就走向了未知 走向了学科的前沿

1705
02:55:31,352 --> 02:55:34,889
而且 当您成为专家时 您就会从中心走向前沿

1706
02:55:35,331 --> 02:55:45,610
所以 那么你就处于边界上 当你是一名学者 一名有能力的学者时 你就处于未探索的边界 或者已探索的与未探索的边界

1707
02:55:46,014 --> 02:55:47,529
而你正试图进一步拓展这个边界

1708
02:55:47,630 --> 02:55:51,125
所以即使你只是抽象地做这件事 它也是一样的

1709
02:55:51,872 --> 02:55:59,307
这反映了这样一个事实：每个人类环境 无论是具体的还是抽象的 都没有区别

1710
02:56:00,196 --> 02:56:06,903
概括了宇宙-混沌二分法 或者秩序-混沌二分法

1711
02:56:07,630 --> 02:56:09,085
这就是为什么在道教中 例如

1712
02:56:09,630 --> 02:56:16,930
混乱与秩序的结合构成了存在本身 而你就站在混乱与秩序的边界上

1713
02:56:16,954 --> 02:56:27,554
因为那里才是合适的地方 太有秩序、太有探索性的话 你什么都学不到 而潜藏着很多掠食者的地方 你会被恐惧冻住

1714
02:56:27,578 --> 02:56:32,567
这些位置都不理想

1715
02:56:32,591 --> 02:56:42,591
这就是你所知道的 所以你认为 这显然是一个具体的现实 也是一个心理现实 这些墙是有原因的 对吧

1716
02:56:42,615 --> 02:56:46,515
因为墙内都是像我们这样的人

1717
02:56:46,567 --> 02:56:50,683
这就引出了一个问题 人们像我们一样意味着什么

1718
02:56:50,683 --> 02:57:02,169
然后墙外就有那些人 因为他们是最恶劣的掠夺者 因为人们实际上是最恶劣的掠夺者 他们不像我们

1719
02:57:02,169 --> 02:57:07,910
墙的存在是为了区分像我们和不像我们的人 所以

1720
02:57:08,171 --> 02:57:15,070
这是生死攸关的事情 你可以从他们必须亲手建造那些墙壁看出来

1721
02:57:15,094 --> 02:57:27,194
你知道 你确实会看到有三层城墙的城市 所以这些人是非常害怕的 但没有那些建造三层城墙的人那么害怕 那些人真的是非常非常害怕

1722
02:57:27,194 --> 02:57:28,326
他们有他们的理由

1723
02:57:29,294 --> 02:57:30,844
那么 好吧 那么...

1724
02:57:32,812 --> 02:57:41,369
现在 雅各天梯的故事反映了一个思想

1725
02:57:42,031 --> 02:57:48,208
中心 也就是你放置柱子的地方 也是天地相接的地方

1726
02:57:49,314 --> 02:57:51,750
这是一个复杂的思想

1727
02:57:52,292 --> 02:57:57,390
我想你可以知道我正在尝试从心理学的角度来看待这些故事

1728
02:57:57,811 --> 02:58:03,190
所以你可以说这是一个象征性的地方 最低的和最高的聚集在一起

1729
02:58:04,234 --> 02:58:05,608
所以这是一个地方

1730
02:58:07,431 --> 02:58:13,490
尘世的存在延伸到最高可能的道德抽象 这是中心 因为

1731
02:58:14,772 --> 02:58:23,780
与他们（墙外的人）相比 我们的一个特点是 我们在某种道德规范下团结一致

1732
02:58:23,780 --> 02:58:26,387
这就是我们相同的原因

1733
02:58:26,387 --> 02:58:34,487
这是一个复杂的推理过程 但我会在给你看更多图片后再回到它

1734
02:58:34,511 --> 02:58:41,711
但这就是第一个思想 中心是最低点和最高点同时接触的地方

1735
02:58:41,735 --> 02:58:46,635
所以你可以说 在某种意义上它指定了一群人的目标

1736
02:58:46,702 --> 02:58:47,625
那是另一种方式

1737
02:58:47,625 --> 02:58:54,525
即使在工作中 如果你与人们聚集在一起组成一个团队 你也会围绕一个项目进行分组

1738
02:58:54,549 --> 02:59:01,849
这使你们团结起来 它使你们团结起来 因为你们都有相同的目标 你们都指向同一件事 这使你们在某些方面是相同的 因为

1739
02:59:01,873 --> 02:59:07,373
如果你追求的东西和我一样 那么同样的东西对你来说也很重要 对我来说也很重要

1740
02:59:07,397 --> 02:59:14,497
同样的事情会对你产生负面影响 也会对我产生负面影响 因为我们的情绪就是这样运作的 这意味着我可以立即预测你

1741
02:59:14,497 --> 02:59:21,197
我知道你会如何表现 所以我们的目标基本上是我们的道德目标 因为我们的目标是更好的东西 至少在原则上我们的目标是更好的东西

1742
02:59:21,221 --> 02:59:28,921
我们的道德目标统一了我们的看法 也协调了我们的情感

1743
02:59:28,945 --> 02:59:36,045
因此这就引出了一个问题：如果您要围绕社区聚集的目标建立一个社区

1744
02:59:36,045 --> 02:59:44,645
好吧 这里的思想是 社区的中心是连接天地的支柱 因此它将最低的与最高的连接在一起

1745
02:59:44,671 --> 02:59:49,290
所以有一些 "最高的把社区结合在一起 "的暗示

1746
02:59:50,273 --> 02:59:52,189
好的 所以请记住这一点

1747
02:59:53,374 --> 02:59:54,889
这也是一个非常古老的思想

1748
02:59:55,432 --> 02:59:59,590
这就是世界轴的概念 它是连接天地的中心极

1749
02:59:59,911 --> 03:00:05,070
这是一个令人难以置信的古老思想 已有数万年的历史 甚至可以追溯到

1750
03:00:05,852 --> 03:00:13,270
不管我们的古老记忆 准记忆 我不知道你会怎么描述它们 我们的原型记忆

1751
03:00:14,654 --> 03:00:24,190
来自于我们极其久远的祖先和树木 当树木本身实际上是世界的中心 而且它被蛇和混沌所环绕

1752
03:00:24,214 --> 03:00:31,814
我们不知道这些想法有多古老 但它们非常非常古老 进化是一个保守的领域

1753
03:00:31,838 --> 03:00:38,938
一旦它构建了一个小工具 然后就在那个小工具的基础上构建新的东西 就像一个中世纪的小镇一样

1754
03:00:38,938 --> 03:00:51,938
小镇的中心非常古老 而围绕着它建造的是相对较新的区域 但中心仍然非常古老 这就像我们一样 你知道 我们的平台

1755
03:00:51,992 --> 03:01:03,070
像我们的基本生理结构 这个骨骼体系比我们早了几千万年 或者更久 如果你考虑到脊椎动物 那就更久了

1756
03:01:03,094 --> 03:01:09,194
而且这一切都被保存下来了 所以一切都是建立在一切之上的

1757
03:01:09,274 --> 03:01:11,870
好吧 所以有一种经典的小镇

1758
03:01:13,572 --> 03:01:18,570
我向你展示了这个思想 这是斯堪的纳维亚世界树 同样的思想 它统一了天地

1759
03:01:19,051 --> 03:01:29,350
在那棵树的根部周围有蛇不断地吃这棵树 所以这就是稳定的思想 但围绕这种稳定和稳定存在着不断的转变

1760
03:01:30,634 --> 03:01:32,509
与此同时 蛇也在啃食树根

1761
03:01:32,509 --> 03:01:34,765
有溪流滋养着它

1762
03:01:35,751 --> 03:01:45,068
所以这有点像生命依赖于死亡和不断更新的观点 因为你的细胞正在死亡并不断更新 对吗

1763
03:01:45,430 --> 03:01:48,068
如果它们只是增殖 那么你就患有癌症

1764
03:01:48,390 --> 03:01:50,044
如果他们快要死了 那么你也死了

1765
03:01:50,790 --> 03:01:57,022
你必须在死与生之间取得恰到好处的平衡 这样你才能真正活下去 这也是一件很奇怪的事情

1766
03:01:58,730 --> 03:02:05,084
那棵树是从微观世界的底层一直延伸到宏观世界的东西

1767
03:02:05,650 --> 03:02:06,621
无论如何 这就是这个思想

1768
03:02:07,410 --> 03:02:14,350
那么 好吧 那就是雅各和他的支柱

1769
03:02:14,490 --> 03:02:21,249
他有一个思想 你可以用这块石头标记中心 就像它象征着他做梦时躺在的东西上一样 但现在他有了这个思想

1770
03:02:21,330 --> 03:02:29,109
你把一些东西直立起来 它标志着中心 它象征着他对最高善的愿景 比如

1771
03:02:30,072 --> 03:02:36,290
对他做出的承诺 然后这是一座埃及方尖碑 上面是金字塔

1772
03:02:37,531 --> 03:02:38,374
那是在巴黎

1773
03:02:38,374 --> 03:02:44,715
它是从卢克索拿走并放在巴黎的 所以这是一个更加复杂的

1774
03:02:47,251 --> 03:02:52,290
同样的思想的例子好吧 欧亚大陆有石器时代的文化

1775
03:02:53,193 --> 03:02:58,130
像巨石阵这样巨大的地方到处都竖起了这些巨大的方尖碑 这就是一个很好的例子

1776
03:02:58,472 --> 03:03:01,990
它非常复杂 而且它们也是空间的标记

1777
03:03:02,551 --> 03:03:08,450
我们不知道它们的确切功能是什么 但它们非常类似于一些永久的地点标记

1778
03:03:10,751 --> 03:03:22,910
有一个很好的地方 那就是在圣彼得斯 我真的很喜欢这个 因为你可以看到雅各在那里建立领地的愿景 对吗

1779
03:03:22,990 --> 03:03:28,129
方尖碑位于中间 然后是从中心辐射的方向

1780
03:03:28,671 --> 03:03:30,456
当然 还有圣彼得教堂

1781
03:03:30,456 --> 03:03:35,610
这就是罗马的圣彼得大教堂 这是一个绝对令人难以置信的地方

1782
03:03:35,751 --> 03:03:37,266
简直令人瞠目结舌

1783
03:03:38,212 --> 03:03:44,130
而且 大教堂在它的后面 然后是围绕着它的一圈柱子

1784
03:03:44,431 --> 03:03:48,369
您可以在中间左侧看到它们

1785
03:03:48,831 --> 03:03:55,009
这一直围绕着整个围场 而且 呃 那里可以聚集很多人

1786
03:03:55,871 --> 03:04:05,050
然后 那个柱子标志着中心 这将是天主教的中心 本质上 这就是它所代表的 对的 天主教的象征性中心

1787
03:04:05,912 --> 03:04:13,430
虽然你可以说大教堂是中心 但这其实并不重要 它们非常接近 彼此之间差不多是六个一半 半斤八两

1788
03:04:14,531 --> 03:04:21,889
然后 这是同一思想的另一种表述 对吧 这就是为什么人们不喜欢国旗被烧毁

1789
03:04:21,913 --> 03:04:27,813
因为保守派人士将旗帜视为将人们联系在一起的神圣之物

1790
03:04:27,850 --> 03:04:33,949
因此 当那个神圣的东西被摧毁时 他们并不高兴 即使它是以抗议的名义被摧毁的

1791
03:04:33,973 --> 03:04:40,773
而那些焚烧旗帜的人则认为 好吧 有时会夸大中心已经腐败的思想

1792
03:04:40,830 --> 03:04:52,690
你可以通过把它付诸火炬来证明这一点 代表着作为腐败中心现在必须被烧毁和改造

1793
03:04:53,411 --> 03:04:55,274
事实是 他们都是对的

1794
03:04:55,274 --> 03:05:04,410
他们一直都是对的 因为中心是绝对必要的 是神圣的 但几乎总是腐败的 需要修复

1795
03:05:04,692 --> 03:05:06,227
这也是一个典型的思想

1796
03:05:07,012 --> 03:05:12,130
了解这一点很有用 因为 尤其是年轻人很容易认为

1797
03:05:13,172 --> 03:05:19,990
好吧 世界将陷入地狱 这是上一代人的错 他们给我们留下了这个可怕的烂摊子

1798
03:05:20,014 --> 03:05:27,715
而且 我们对此感到非常背叛 现在我们必须清理它 就像 是的 是的 人们已经这样想了大约 35,000 年

1799
03:05:27,715 --> 03:05:28,579
这并不新鲜

1800
03:05:28,579 --> 03:05:35,490
它之所以不新鲜是因为它总是正确的 你所得到的是一个有缺陷的神圣中心

1801
03:05:36,233 --> 03:05:37,177
永远 永远

1802
03:05:37,177 --> 03:05:39,948
部分原因是它是死者的创造 对吧

1803
03:05:40,650 --> 03:05:44,970
死者看不见 也无法交流 所以他们与现在没有联系

1804
03:05:45,472 --> 03:05:53,330
所以他们留给你的东西 除了它实际上可能是腐败的这一事实（这是一个稍微不同的事情）之外 至少是盲目的和死的

1805
03:05:53,390 --> 03:05:56,749
那么你到底能对一个盲目而死的东西指望什么呢

1806
03:05:56,910 --> 03:06:00,130
如果它没有让你消失 那你就很幸运了

1807
03:06:00,832 --> 03:06:06,150
所以这显然是一张可爱的照片 这就是一个新中心的建立

1808
03:06:07,217 --> 03:06:07,359
然后

1809
03:06:08,813 --> 03:06:17,210
中心也可以是大教堂 当然通常是经典的城镇 特别是欧洲城镇

1810
03:06:18,234 --> 03:06:20,170
不只是欧洲小镇是这样的

1811
03:06:20,431 --> 03:06:23,950
有一个用石头建成的中心 那就是大教堂

1812
03:06:24,252 --> 03:06:33,870
塔顶上有最高的塔 通常有一个十字架 那是象征性的中心 所以人们都会聚集在十字架周围

1813
03:06:34,630 --> 03:06:40,370
现在表示十字显然代表一个中心 因为它是一个x 右x标记了该点

1814
03:06:40,871 --> 03:06:47,330
所以十字架的中心就是中心 然后大教堂通常呈十字形 这也标志着中心

1815
03:06:47,792 --> 03:06:56,162
然后在大教堂里经常有一个圆顶 那就是天空 那就是从地球到天堂的梯子

1816
03:06:56,162 --> 03:06:58,390
所以这是同一个思想的重述

1817
03:06:59,333 --> 03:07:12,657
因此 人们被那个中心所吸引 而这个中心是将他们团结起来的象征 而将他们团结起来的是大教堂所体现的信仰

1818
03:07:12,657 --> 03:07:14,987
你想 那么 信仰意味着什么

1819
03:07:14,987 --> 03:07:24,106
再说一遍 我们正在从心理上解决这个问题 这意味着该群体的每个成员都接受该群体的超越理想

1820
03:07:24,106 --> 03:07:29,333
现在的问题是 如果你是一个团体的成员 你就接受这个团体的超越理想

1821
03:07:29,333 --> 03:07:32,127
这就是成为团体成员的意义

1822
03:07:32,127 --> 03:07:41,089
因此 如果你在一个工作团队中 并且大家都在从事一个项目 那么你本质上所做的就是决定你将使目标变得不容置疑 对吗

1823
03:07:41,089 --> 03:07:48,710
我的意思是 你们可能会争论细节 但如果你们被分配了某件事 这是一份适合你们 10 个人的工作 围绕工作组织自己

1824
03:07:48,734 --> 03:07:54,834
你可以讨论你将如何完成这项工作 但你不能讨论工作本身 否则团队就会分崩离析

1825
03:07:54,858 --> 03:08:04,258
因此 在某种意义上存在一种信仰行为 信仰行为是必要的 因为它很难具体说明

1826
03:08:04,271 --> 03:08:09,650
鉴于有许多不同的目标 我们必须准确无误地确定中心目标

1827
03:08:09,674 --> 03:08:18,490
这是一件非常非常难以弄清楚的事情 这是我们今晚要做的事情 就像一个团体聚集在一起的目标应该是什么

1828
03:08:19,553 --> 03:08:22,090
所以特别是如果这是一个大团体

1829
03:08:22,752 --> 03:08:28,230
这是一个庞大的群体 需要在非常长的时间跨度中保持团结 这个群体是

1830
03:08:28,850 --> 03:08:37,130
难以置信地多样化 你知道 什么样的理想可能会统一一个在非常长的时间跨度中 由多样化的人组成的大群体

1831
03:08:37,613 --> 03:08:45,370
这是一个非常非常难的问题 我认为部分回答这个问题的方式是 它以象征性的方式被回答 象征性地和通过图像

1832
03:08:45,394 --> 03:08:50,594
因为它实在是太复杂了 几乎不可能用语言来表达

1833
03:08:50,631 --> 03:08:55,710
所以 但显然你需要有一个每个人都可以团结起来的中心 因为如果你不这样做

1834
03:08:56,272 --> 03:09:02,690
然后每个人都会互相争吵 就像我不知道你在做什么 你也不知道他在做什么我们没有 我们只是陌生人

1835
03:09:03,151 --> 03:09:13,990
我们根本不知道我们的道德是否匹配 那么我们能够和谐相处的可能性就会迅速下降到零 这显然是没有好处的

1836
03:09:14,392 --> 03:09:25,110
这是一种完全混乱的状态 所以我们不能认为没有中心理想就不可能存在 这是不可能的 而且比这更深刻

1837
03:09:25,431 --> 03:09:42,270
它比这更深刻 部分原因是我不知道 我会尽力解决这个问题 这是我与萨姆·哈里斯争论的事情 你的范畴系统是你目标的产物

1838
03:09:42,294 --> 03:09:53,694
事情就像这样 如果你手头有一组事实 这些事实不会告诉你如何对事实进行分类 因为事实太多了 有一万亿个事实

1839
03:09:53,712 --> 03:10:02,090
如果不对它们施加某种先验的顺序 就没有办法确定你应该如何排序它们 那么你该如何排序它们呢 这很简单

1840
03:10:02,635 --> 03:10:04,450
你决定你的目标

1841
03:10:05,852 --> 03:10:06,938
现在你该怎么做呢

1842
03:10:07,441 --> 03:10:09,130
我现在先不回答这个问题

1843
03:10:09,391 --> 03:10:13,209
我只是说 为了组织这些事实 你需要一个目标

1844
03:10:14,252 --> 03:10:18,970
然后 目标立即将事实组织成与目标相关的工具

1845
03:10:19,231 --> 03:10:25,290
比方说 那些碍事的事情 以及大量你根本不需要关注的事情

1846
03:10:26,314 --> 03:10:27,284
它把它们排除了

1847
03:10:28,312 --> 03:10:30,565
比如 如果你在解决一个工程问题

1848
03:10:30,565 --> 03:10:31,390
你不需要担心

1849
03:10:32,391 --> 03:10:36,950
啊 啊 在你的社区实践医学

1850
03:10:38,030 --> 03:10:45,130
你知道 有一堆 比如如果你专注于某个特定的 啊 你怎么说

1851
03:10:47,571 --> 03:10:58,150
任何 任何工作 任何一套技能都意味着你擅长一小部分事情 然后在其他极其众多的技能上不擅长

1852
03:10:58,611 --> 03:11:04,290
它简化了事情 因此您可以使用您的目标作为范畴系统的基础

1853
03:11:04,832 --> 03:11:10,753
所以你也必须记住这一点 因为据我所知 它的意思是

1854
03:11:12,471 --> 03:11:18,130
你的范畴系统本身 即构成你的看法的东西 实际上取决于你的目标伦理

1855
03:11:18,573 --> 03:11:19,782
直接的

1856
03:11:19,782 --> 03:11:20,850
这是道德问题

1857
03:11:21,332 --> 03:11:29,610
这直接取决于你的目标 如果这是真的 那是一个令人震惊的思想 这不是人们对思考的常规看法

1858
03:11:29,634 --> 03:11:37,734
我们不是那样思考的 我们喜欢认为我们是决定论地思考的 可以说 或者我们是经验主义地思考 或者我们是理性地思考

1859
03:11:37,758 --> 03:11:47,358
但这一切其实似乎都不是我们所做的：我们设定了一个有效的目标 然后我们围绕这个目标组织世界 并且有大量的证据表明这一点

1860
03:11:47,390 --> 03:11:53,841
对知觉的心理学研究表明 这确实像知觉系统的运作方式

1861
03:11:53,841 --> 03:11:57,114
大多数情况下他们忽略 因为世界太复杂了

1862
03:11:57,114 --> 03:12:02,835
他们专注于一小部分被认为与目标相关的现象

1863
03:12:02,835 --> 03:12:05,065
然后当然 目标本身就是有问题的

1864
03:12:05,065 --> 03:12:15,170
再说一遍 这很复杂 因为我的目标必须是你们中的一些人的目标 或者至少不反对 因为否则我根本无法实现我的该死的目标

1865
03:12:15,572 --> 03:12:18,344
它必须在世界上切实可行

1866
03:12:18,344 --> 03:12:30,250
它必须至少在一段时间内可持续 它不会杀死我 就像它真的对冲这个目标一样 它不是任何旧事物 几乎没有任何东西可以成为它

1867
03:12:31,172 --> 03:12:38,170
所以雅各的目标是破坏以扫 差点让他被杀

1868
03:12:38,854 --> 03:12:43,710
你可以理解为什么你认为那是一件令人讨厌的工作

1869
03:12:43,734 --> 03:12:54,834
你可以理解以扫的愤怒 即使我们与这些故事中的人们分开了 4,000年 3,000年 类似的事情 你马上就知道

1870
03:12:54,911 --> 03:13:01,610
为什么每个人都会有这样的感觉 至少当你了解了故事的背景后 你会发现这一切一点也不神秘

1871
03:13:02,894 --> 03:13:03,076
所以...

1872
03:13:04,913 --> 03:13:07,490
所以就有了教堂 而教堂就在十字架下面

1873
03:13:09,351 --> 03:13:15,630
对了 这就是圣彼得大教堂 所以大教堂顶部的地球上有一个十字架

1874
03:13:16,191 --> 03:13:20,449
方尖碑上还有十字架

1875
03:13:21,411 --> 03:13:26,530
所以 这意味着 这就是事情变得异常复杂的地方

1876
03:13:27,651 --> 03:13:31,869
中心是由十字代表的任何东西定义的

1877
03:13:32,391 --> 03:13:37,189
现在 十字架在地理上代表了一个交叉点 确实如此

1878
03:13:37,731 --> 03:13:40,329
十字架可能在某种程度上代表身体

1879
03:13:40,950 --> 03:13:45,089
但显然 十字架也代表受苦的地方

1880
03:13:45,752 --> 03:13:50,409
更重要的是 它代表了自愿受苦的超越之地

1881
03:13:51,172 --> 03:13:53,440
我说的是心理层面的吧

1882
03:13:53,440 --> 03:13:54,945
不是神学上的

1883
03:13:54,945 --> 03:13:55,929
这就是它所代表的

1884
03:13:56,591 --> 03:14:03,470
所以你可能会说 把方尖碑和十字架放在一起 说这就是中心 这就是背后的思想

1885
03:14:04,275 --> 03:14:05,989
所以这就是每个人的目标

1886
03:14:06,130 --> 03:14:11,530
所以这个思想是 好吧 如果你想成为这个方尖碑所定义的群体中的一员

1887
03:14:11,554 --> 03:14:19,354
那么你要做的就是自愿接受自己处于痛苦中心的位置 从而超越它

1888
03:14:19,431 --> 03:14:20,775
就是这个思想

1889
03:14:20,775 --> 03:14:23,122
这是一个绝妙的思想

1890
03:14:23,122 --> 03:14:24,146
确实如此 伙计

1891
03:14:24,146 --> 03:14:25,469
That is a killer idea.

1892
03:14:25,911 --> 03:14:30,489
因为它实际上是一个信号 是一个非常明确的心理健康信号

1893
03:14:31,192 --> 03:14:35,869
因为如果你是一名临床心理学家 而某人因恐惧而瘫痪 你会做的一件事是

1894
03:14:36,792 --> 03:14:41,350
你要做的就是将他们的恐惧分解成相对容易控制的部分

1895
03:14:41,952 --> 03:14:50,252
然后你让他们自愿面对他们的恐惧 如果他们有强迫症 也可能是他们对此感到厌恶的事情

1896
03:14:50,276 --> 03:14:59,176
但它会产生非常强烈的负面情绪 无论是什么 然后你让他们自愿面对任何产生压倒性负面情绪的东西

1897
03:14:59,200 --> 03:15:06,100
这让他们变得更坚强 但这并没有让他们减少恐惧

1898
03:15:06,120 --> 03:15:07,968
这让他们更加勇敢、更加坚强

1899
03:15:07,968 --> 03:15:09,254
这不是一回事

1900
03:15:09,254 --> 03:15:10,178
真的不是

1901
03:15:10,178 --> 03:15:12,267
它并不能减少恐惧

1902
03:15:12,267 --> 03:15:14,536
它增加了勇气

1903
03:15:14,536 --> 03:15:17,746
所以 这是一个令人难以置信的思想

1904
03:15:17,746 --> 03:15:18,409
而且还更深

1905
03:15:18,409 --> 03:15:25,943
这些原型思想真正有趣的事情之一是 也许部分原因是圣经的超链接性质

1906
03:15:25,967 --> 03:15:31,967
这是其中的一部分 但不是全部 无论你挖得有多深 你都永远无法探底

1907
03:15:32,043 --> 03:15:40,170
你触到了谷底 你想 上帝 这是如此令人难以置信的深刻 然后如果你在下面挖掘一点 你会发现其他东西 那就更深刻了

1908
03:15:40,194 --> 03:15:50,294
你认为哇 那一定是底部 然后你在下面挖 就像没有底部一样 你可以继续往下挖 据我所知 你可以一层又一层地往下挖

1909
03:15:50,334 --> 03:16:02,089
我们将更多地讨论十字架作为中心的含义 因为你看到人们试图弄清楚的是 我们需要团结在什么之下

1910
03:16:02,532 --> 03:16:02,754
正确的

1911
03:16:02,754 --> 03:16:04,710
团结在什么之下才是正确的

1912
03:16:05,031 --> 03:16:06,217
我可以再举一个例子

1913
03:16:06,217 --> 03:16:08,408
所以 在美索不达米亚社会

1914
03:16:09,412 --> 03:16:14,569
皇帝 他或多或少是一个绝对的君主

1915
03:16:15,112 --> 03:16:18,129
他住在本质上是一座有城墙的城市里

1916
03:16:18,853 --> 03:16:22,169
美索不达米亚人的神是马尔杜克

1917
03:16:22,732 --> 03:16:27,612
马杜克是那个头上长满眼睛的人物 他会说神奇的话语

1918
03:16:27,612 --> 03:16:30,204
所以它非常细心并且非常善于表达

1919
03:16:30,204 --> 03:16:37,350
而正是马杜克出去 与混沌女神、混沌之龙对峙 将她切成碎片 组成了世界

1920
03:16:37,851 --> 03:16:40,137
好的 这样你就可以明白这意味着什么了

1921
03:16:40,137 --> 03:16:51,710
因此 马杜克超越了边境 进入了掠夺性的混沌之地 遇到了可怕的事物 然后从中产生了一些富有成效的东西

1922
03:16:52,212 --> 03:17:03,430
所以这是一个英雄神话 马杜克被所有其他美索不达米亚诸神选为至高无上的上帝 因为他做到了这一点 所以马杜克的思想出现在神圣的世界中

1923
03:17:05,530 --> 03:17:14,026
统治等级制度达到顶峰 天知道这需要多长时间 这将是许多部落的合并

1924
03:17:15,414 --> 03:17:22,230
然后是所有部落神话的升华产生了这个关于构成最高神的故事

1925
03:17:22,510 --> 03:17:26,830
然后皇帝的工作就是扮演马杜克

1926
03:17:27,631 --> 03:17:34,330
这就是赋予他主权的原因 所以他成为人们围绕其组织自己的中心 并不是因为他

1927
03:17:35,111 --> 03:17:41,450
在他成为一个合适的皇帝时 并不是因为他有什么特别特殊的 像是权力并不完全存在于他身上

1928
03:17:42,032 --> 03:17:49,197
这是一个非常有用的区分 对吧 你想要的是权力 这就是为什么拥有一个象征性的君主挺好的

1929
03:17:49,197 --> 03:17:53,010
你得到的是与个人权力分离的象征性权力 对吗

1930
03:17:53,030 --> 03:17:54,560
因为否则它们会被混为一谈

1931
03:17:54,560 --> 03:17:55,829
这就是罗马发生的事情

1932
03:17:56,452 --> 03:18:00,010
你可以看到这种情况在美国时不时就会发生

1933
03:18:00,151 --> 03:18:02,345
就像肯尼迪王朝之类的

1934
03:18:03,050 --> 03:18:08,528
因此 只要皇帝正确地履行马杜克的职责 他就拥有主权

1935
03:18:09,030 --> 03:18:12,990
然后走出混乱 将其切成碎片并恢复秩序

1936
03:18:13,478 --> 03:18:20,910
那是他的工作 所以他们常常在过年的时候把他带到城外 剥掉他所有的皇帝衣服

1937
03:18:21,470 --> 03:18:29,970
羞辱他 然后强迫他承认那一年他不是一个好马杜克

1938
03:18:30,951 --> 03:18:40,170
他不是一个好的统治者 所以这应该给他提供线索并唤醒他 然后他们会仪式性地重演马杜克之战

1939
03:18:41,072 --> 03:18:44,240
使用雕像对抗混沌怪物提亚马特

1940
03:18:44,240 --> 03:18:50,460
然后 如果一切顺利的话 皇帝就会回去 这座城市就会再延续一年

1941
03:18:50,460 --> 03:18:53,210
在我们的新年庆祝活动中 仍然回荡着这样的声音 不是吗

1942
03:18:53,210 --> 03:18:57,930
同样的思想已经回响了所有那些世纪、几千年

1943
03:18:58,712 --> 03:19:01,663
所以这是一个非常绝妙的主意 对吧

1944
03:19:01,663 --> 03:19:03,350
因为 所以这个思想的一部分是

1945
03:19:04,292 --> 03:19:08,970
主权的东西 所以这是中心的支柱 每个人都聚集在周围

1946
03:19:09,452 --> 03:19:13,529
是 至少在某种程度上 勇敢地走向未知的事物

1947
03:19:13,931 --> 03:19:17,009
并从中做出一些对社区有用的东西

1948
03:19:18,076 --> 03:19:18,243
所以...

1949
03:19:21,131 --> 03:19:22,723
这非常非常聪明

1950
03:19:22,723 --> 03:19:23,548
它非常聪明

1951
03:19:25,151 --> 03:19:27,118
这是中心的另一个例子

1952
03:19:27,118 --> 03:19:29,909
这是国旗 这是英国国旗 等等

1953
03:19:30,813 --> 03:19:33,023
它是由一堆十字架组成的 对吗

1954
03:19:33,023 --> 03:19:38,150
所以第一个十字 英国十字 那是圣乔治的旗帜 那是英格兰的旗帜

1955
03:19:38,431 --> 03:19:41,660
圣乔治是做什么的

1956
03:19:41,660 --> 03:19:43,124
准确的说是屠龙

1957
03:19:43,124 --> 03:19:44,127
同样的思想 对吧

1958
03:19:44,127 --> 03:19:50,374
于是 英格兰的守护神圣乔治出面杀死了恶龙 并将圣母从恶龙的魔掌中解救出来

1959
03:19:50,374 --> 03:19:51,276
同样的思想 对吧

1960
03:19:51,276 --> 03:19:52,620
这就是中心

1961
03:19:52,620 --> 03:19:59,799
第二个十字架被称为celtier 但它是另一个十字架

1962
03:19:59,799 --> 03:20:02,547
这就是圣安德鲁被钉在十字架上的十字架

1963
03:20:03,490 --> 03:20:04,504
所以这是同样的思想

1964
03:20:04,930 --> 03:20:10,809
该中心是自愿承担苦难的中心 因为圣安德鲁是一位烈士

1965
03:20:11,230 --> 03:20:13,507
然后圣帕特里克是第三个十字架

1966
03:20:13,970 --> 03:20:15,419
圣帕特里克在爱尔兰做了什么

1967
03:20:17,290 --> 03:20:19,309
把所有的蛇都赶跑了 对吗

1968
03:20:19,450 --> 03:20:21,286
所以这是同一件事 对吧

1969
03:20:21,710 --> 03:20:27,620
因此 英国国旗是定义中心的所有这三个十字的组合

1970
03:20:28,130 --> 03:20:29,084
这就是旗帜

1971
03:20:29,530 --> 03:20:31,102
这象征着这一切

1972
03:20:32,230 --> 03:20:35,623
所以 这完全令人难以置信

1973
03:20:37,470 --> 03:20:39,589
关于圣帕特里克还有更多信息

1974
03:20:39,750 --> 03:20:44,889
所以他在禁食 40 天后驱逐了蛇 所以这是对 40 年的暗示

1975
03:20:45,410 --> 03:20:50,628
摩西在沙漠中度过的40天 以及新约中基督禁食的40天

1976
03:20:51,150 --> 03:20:54,126
当他种下他的手杖时 它就会长成一棵树

1977
03:20:54,790 --> 03:20:58,648
因此 这呼应了我们刚才描述的有关该中心的所有思想

1978
03:20:59,130 --> 03:21:07,001
他还与古代爱尔兰祖先交谈 如果你还记得的话 这是萨满仪式的一个特点

1979
03:21:08,770 --> 03:21:20,026
因此 在典型的萨满仪式中 这似乎是由迷幻剂的使用引起的 萨满会溶解到他们的骨头里

1980
03:21:20,050 --> 03:21:25,850
然后他们升到天上和祖先说话 然后他们被引入天国

1981
03:21:25,874 --> 03:21:31,974
然后他们的肉又回到了骨头上 他们回来告诉每个人发生了什么事

1982
03:21:32,026 --> 03:21:35,057
这是一次可重复的经历 对吧

1983
03:21:35,057 --> 03:21:38,628
萨满教的传统令人难以置信地广泛传播

1984
03:21:38,628 --> 03:21:45,372
那么整个欧洲 古代欧洲和亚洲 也许远至南美洲 对吧

1985
03:21:45,372 --> 03:21:52,556
它是高度保守的 而且我们的宗教观念很可能就是在这种传统之外出现的

1986
03:21:52,556 --> 03:21:54,480
所以 你可以在这里看到类似的情况

1987
03:21:58,871 --> 03:22:06,026
回到雅各和他的梯子的故事 这样我就可以平安地回到我父亲的家 然后耶和华就是我的神

1988
03:22:06,026 --> 03:22:13,041
我所立为柱子的这块石头将成为神的殿 凡你所赐给我的 我必将十分之一献给你

1989
03:22:13,041 --> 03:22:24,221
所以我想说 这也是对那些攀登权力阶层的人有义务照顾底层人的呼应 对吗

1990
03:22:24,221 --> 03:22:29,887
因为如果你把什一奉献看作是一种财富分配形式 它本质上就是财富分配

1991
03:22:29,911 --> 03:22:43,011
那么定义与该中心相关的正确道德努力的伦理道德的一部分就是 不要以牺牲整个社会为代价来提升自己

1992
03:22:43,030 --> 03:22:49,929
所以 如果你足够幸运 你可以提升权威、权力和能力

1993
03:22:50,291 --> 03:22:59,807
在一个社区的范围内 你仍然有义务维护这个结构 维护并进一步发展你所在的社区的结构

1994
03:23:00,310 --> 03:23:01,426
这很明显 对吧

1995
03:23:01,670 --> 03:23:05,540
因为如果几代人之后人们不这样做 整个事情就会崩溃

1996
03:23:06,190 --> 03:23:12,448
所以 破坏你正在获胜的游戏是不合理的

1997
03:23:13,010 --> 03:23:15,546
加强你正在获胜的游戏是合理的

1998
03:23:16,170 --> 03:23:27,626
所以这是另一回事 因为这也描述了一种道德 它应该让你成为社区的积极成员 而这个社区聚集在这个中心周围

1999
03:23:29,450 --> 03:23:40,824
所以我学到的关于英雄神话的一件事是我非常非常喜欢的 所以你可以在基督的形象中清楚地看到这一点 但因为在这个故事中两件事是结合在一起的

2000
03:23:41,610 --> 03:23:47,070
但基督也是英雄 有两种英雄 一种是陷入混乱的英雄

2001
03:23:47,094 --> 03:23:53,994
对抗混沌之龙并收集宝藏 然后与社区分享

2002
03:23:53,994 --> 03:24:00,794
另一种形式的英雄是反抗腐败国家的英雄

2003
03:24:00,813 --> 03:24:10,950
动摇国家的基础 让它崩溃 然后重建它 因为人类面临的两大危险

2004
03:24:11,251 --> 03:24:17,435
一是毫无保护地暴露在自然世界的灾难中 二是屈从于暴政

2005
03:24:17,435 --> 03:24:28,821
因此 英雄就是 他们心目中的终极英雄就是利用自己在未知领域收集到的信息重建国家结构的人

2006
03:24:28,821 --> 03:24:30,328
这将他们俩团结在一起

2007
03:24:30,328 --> 03:24:36,545
据我所知 这意味着什么

2008
03:24:36,545 --> 03:24:38,230
所以一个结构 一个中心

2009
03:24:38,832 --> 03:24:42,343
有两个与之相关的风险

2010
03:24:42,343 --> 03:24:44,409
一是它会堕落为混乱

2011
03:24:44,409 --> 03:24:44,590
和

2012
03:24:45,174 --> 03:24:47,490
另一个是它会僵化成暴政

2013
03:24:49,194 --> 03:24:50,547
将会堕落为混沌

2014
03:24:52,151 --> 03:24:58,950
即使它只是做它正在做的事情 如果它只是做它正在做的事情而不改变 它就会退化

2015
03:24:59,411 --> 03:25:03,010
因为事情会发生变化 如果不改变就跟不上

2016
03:25:03,532 --> 03:25:08,190
然后它离环境越来越远 就会急剧崩溃

2017
03:25:09,092 --> 03:25:19,790
那么如果它只是随意改变 那么没有人可以建立一个一个稳定的、中心化的目标 那么它立刻就会陷入混乱 谁也无法相处

2018
03:25:20,871 --> 03:25:34,086
所以 属于社区有一条规则 这条规则必须是你必须以维持社区并提高其能力的方式行事

2019
03:25:34,086 --> 03:25:37,898
这是归属感的基本道德义务

2020
03:25:37,898 --> 03:25:39,664
嗯 显然是这样 对吧

2021
03:25:39,664 --> 03:25:41,390
因为为什么你会属于...

2022
03:25:42,155 --> 03:25:44,350
你为什么要走进着火的俱乐部会所

2023
03:25:45,132 --> 03:25:47,003
好像这不太聪明 对吧

2024
03:25:47,003 --> 03:25:48,169
如果你想成为游戏的一部分

2025
03:25:49,372 --> 03:25:54,870
如果您认为参与游戏是值得的 那么您也承担了道德责任

2026
03:25:56,091 --> 03:26:01,170
您还决定 即使您没有注意到 您也必须努力支持该游戏

2027
03:26:01,194 --> 03:26:09,794
因为通过决定玩这个游戏 你已经说过它是有价值的 如果它有价值 那么显然你应该努力维持和扩展它

2028
03:26:09,860 --> 03:26:20,097
因为这是与有价值的事物建立关系的定义 也是社区成员资格的标准

2029
03:26:20,121 --> 03:26:29,021
这就是为什么如果你认为十字架是自愿受苦的象征 你就知道自愿接受苦难

2030
03:26:29,091 --> 03:26:35,863
类似的事情意味着还有另一个值得考虑的因素

2031
03:26:35,887 --> 03:26:41,087
所以你知道该隐失控的原因是因为他在受苦 而且他不接受它

2032
03:26:41,163 --> 03:26:48,690
他绝对不会为此承担责任 他对此感到愤怒和痛苦 这并不奇怪 对吧 我的意思是 我们必须对这类事情保持现实态度

2033
03:26:49,312 --> 03:26:52,470
在你们人生的某个时刻 所有人都会遭受苦难

2034
03:26:53,353 --> 03:27:02,630
以至于让你感到愤怒和痛苦 我是说 这是毫无疑问的 你甚至会想 我愤怒和痛苦是理所当然的

2035
03:27:02,911 --> 03:27:08,610
每个人都会这样 事情是如此可怕 以至于它们甚至没有理由存在

2036
03:27:09,654 --> 03:27:15,404
就像这是一个强有力的论点 尽管我认为它最终会弄巧成拙

2037
03:27:15,404 --> 03:27:17,170
嗯 这就是该隐和亚伯的故事

2038
03:27:18,731 --> 03:27:21,519
该隐和亚伯的故事就是这样

2039
03:27:21,519 --> 03:27:22,803
该怎么说

2040
03:27:22,803 --> 03:27:25,210
这本质上就是该隐和亚伯故事的寓意

2041
03:27:28,258 --> 03:27:36,570
所以这意味着即使在那些相对强烈的痛苦条件下 你也必须自愿接受它 因为否则它会让你反对“存在”

2042
03:27:36,831 --> 03:27:42,449
然后你开始以这种可怕的方式行事 这让一切变得更糟

2043
03:27:42,449 --> 03:27:45,102
在我看来 这其中存在矛盾

2044
03:27:45,102 --> 03:27:52,870
如果你抱怨的原因是事情很糟糕 那么你的行为方式让事情变得更糟是不合理的 对吗

2045
03:27:53,432 --> 03:27:59,030
我的意思是 即使人们这样做并不奇怪 但这是一个堕落的游戏 所以这就是

2046
03:28:00,091 --> 03:28:08,150
所以十字架的思想部分和它所代表的痛苦是 如果你能接受这一点

2047
03:28:08,490 --> 03:28:21,110
自愿地 无论其强度如何 你都不会变得怨恨、怨恨和报复 以至于对社区的稳定构成危险

2048
03:28:22,576 --> 03:28:31,990
所以或者你自己的稳定 因为这可能是你自己的稳定 你家庭的稳定 社区的稳定和世界的稳定 这可能是所有这些

2049
03:28:32,870 --> 03:28:34,744
我越来越认为这一切都是如此

2050
03:28:38,333 --> 03:28:38,898
可以 然后呢

2051
03:28:42,553 --> 03:28:44,629
现在雅各我们得到了雅各故事的第二部分

2052
03:28:49,739 --> 03:28:59,643
他去见他的叔叔拉班 并在那里再次在井边遇见了拉结 他坠入爱河并与拉班住在一起

2053
03:28:59,643 --> 03:29:04,239
那里有两个女儿 利亚和拉结

2054
03:29:04,239 --> 03:29:07,629
利亚并不是一个特别有魅力的人

2055
03:29:07,629 --> 03:29:10,825
具体原因尚不清楚 但故事已经很清楚了

2056
03:29:10,825 --> 03:29:20,170
她绝对是两个女儿中最不受欢迎的一个 故事提到了她的眼睛 目前还不清楚她的生理是否有问题

2057
03:29:20,194 --> 03:29:25,394
或者如果她的态度有问题 虽然不明显 但并不重要 重点是

2058
03:29:25,492 --> 03:29:37,687
她是大女儿 但却是最不受欢迎的女儿 雅各停留一个月 这是当时招待的限制 如果您停留一个月 我们欢迎您

2059
03:29:37,711 --> 03:29:44,211
但你必须为自己的生活而工作 我想大约三天后 类似的事情看起来相当合理

2060
03:29:44,310 --> 03:29:51,210
所以他待了一个月 然后他和拉班聊天 他说此时他已经爱上了拉结

2061
03:29:51,234 --> 03:30:01,434
他说我会和你一起工作七年 然后我会和拉结结婚 拉班说 这是一个很好的交易

2062
03:30:01,452 --> 03:30:16,810
然后七年过去了 举行了一场婚礼 这是一个相当漫长的事情 新娘蒙上了面纱 新娘和雅各一起走进帐篷

2063
03:30:17,372 --> 03:30:20,885
如果我没记错的话--我已经有一个月左右没有看过它了--

2064
03:30:22,831 --> 03:30:34,370
拉结在帐篷外面说话 但利亚在帐篷里面 所以雅各认为他要和拉结结婚 但他实际上是和

2065
03:30:34,711 --> 03:30:45,648
这是一个倒置 因为他在黑暗中 就像愚弄以撒时一样 所以现在轮到雅各了 在黑暗中 他被背叛了

2066
03:30:46,230 --> 03:30:58,010
他的叔叔、他的未婚妻拉结和她的妹妹 其方式与他对以扫的伎俩大致相似 所以那里有一个因果报应的概念

2067
03:30:58,492 --> 03:31:05,668
我想让我的意思是你可能认为业力是一种迷信的思想 但是......

2068
03:31:07,811 --> 03:31:12,549
有多种解释方法可能会证明事实如此 但我认为事实并非如此

2069
03:31:12,549 --> 03:31:12,850
就是那个

2070
03:31:14,072 --> 03:31:15,963
任何恶行都会受到惩罚

2071
03:31:15,963 --> 03:31:17,049
就是这样的

2072
03:31:17,049 --> 03:31:17,310
就像是...

2073
03:31:21,271 --> 03:31:28,070
也许你对某人做了坏事 因此你的一部分对此感到非常内疚 希望如此

2074
03:31:28,651 --> 03:31:35,110
而且 该部分正在寻求惩罚以纠正局面

2075
03:31:35,912 --> 03:31:42,190
你可能会想 好吧 不 但事情是肯定的 除非你是一个精神病患者 事情就是这样运作的

2076
03:31:43,115 --> 03:31:46,190
如果你对这类事情感兴趣 你应该读读陀思妥耶夫斯基的《罪与罚》

2077
03:31:46,512 --> 03:31:49,190
因为它是对此类现象的权威研究

2078
03:31:49,853 --> 03:31:54,190
因为在那本书中 主角拉斯柯尔尼科夫犯下了谋杀罪却逍遥法外

2079
03:31:54,512 --> 03:31:57,190
就像他成功地做到了这一点一样 没有人怀疑他

2080
03:31:58,233 --> 03:32:04,070
但他因内疚而让自己发疯 以至于他让自己落入了警察的手中

2081
03:32:04,592 --> 03:32:09,090
他将自己推入警察手中 因为他无法容忍自己的所作所为

2082
03:32:09,634 --> 03:32:11,190
这非常非常令人惊奇 这是一本令人惊奇的书

2083
03:32:11,330 --> 03:32:22,190
但无论如何 重点在于 雅各陷入了与他过去用来提升自己的那种不正当行为的牺牲品

2084
03:32:22,230 --> 03:32:26,130
这种情况在生活中发生的次数比人们想象的要多得多

2085
03:32:26,532 --> 03:32:30,650
想一想 他真的不能抱怨这件事 如果他有理智的话

2086
03:32:30,951 --> 03:32:35,430
就像他带利亚出去见拉班一样 他说

2087
03:32:36,751 --> 03:32:39,802
这位姐姐到底是怎么回事

2088
03:32:39,802 --> 03:32:41,970
你知道 拉班基本上对他说

2089
03:32:44,095 --> 03:32:54,110
在我们的文化中 习俗是先娶最年长的女儿 这完全正确 他说 这会带来你知道的 他显然在合理化

2090
03:32:54,134 --> 03:32:59,834
因为他刚刚以一种重大的方式欺骗了雅各 但现在已经太晚了

2091
03:32:59,855 --> 03:33:11,548
婚姻已经圆满完成 仪式也已经完成 如果试图解除这段关系 所有的地狱都会爆发 所以

2092
03:33:13,013 --> 03:33:18,150
事情就是这样 利亚结婚了 雅各娶错了妻子

2093
03:33:19,295 --> 03:33:22,990
那么这就是雅各 你在左边看到

2094
03:33:23,271 --> 03:33:29,270
他戴着一顶花帽子 指着利亚 说这发生了什么

2095
03:33:34,443 --> 03:33:34,545
和

2096
03:33:35,011 --> 03:33:41,838
拉班 拉班是个坚强的老山羊 他对此并没有那么难过 事实上你可以想象他会...

2097
03:33:43,334 --> 03:33:43,455
所以

2098
03:33:45,433 --> 03:33:47,470
好吧 那他还得再工作七年

2099
03:33:50,758 --> 03:33:54,710
他得到了拉结 但因为上帝是个狡猾的角色

2100
03:33:56,274 --> 03:33:57,688
这个故事还有另一个转折

2101
03:33:58,812 --> 03:34:06,130
拉结不擅长生儿育女 或者拉结和雅各都不擅长

2102
03:34:06,634 --> 03:34:07,321
但是利亚

2103
03:34:08,534 --> 03:34:09,948
她真的很擅长带孩子

2104
03:34:11,134 --> 03:34:11,276
所以

2105
03:34:12,994 --> 03:34:19,189
她为雅各提供了流便、流便、利未--我相信是利未--还有犹太

2106
03:34:20,111 --> 03:34:22,981
这些名字、这些名字的含义就在那里

2107
03:34:22,981 --> 03:34:25,650
流便的意思是看见儿子 流便的意思是听见

2108
03:34:26,132 --> 03:34:28,205
不过 我认为是“主听到了我的祈祷”

2109
03:34:28,205 --> 03:34:29,130
我想就是这样

2110
03:34:30,052 --> 03:34:32,510
利未的意思是联合 犹大的意思是赞美天父亚乎我(Yahuwah)

2111
03:34:35,131 --> 03:34:37,979
基督就是从犹大支派中兴起的

2112
03:34:37,979 --> 03:34:41,950
在故事的后期 犹大基本上被提升为长子

2113
03:34:42,372 --> 03:34:54,990
这很重要 因为流便、流便和利未都做了一些应受谴责的事情 所以犹大被提升为长子 这就是部分原因

2114
03:34:56,032 --> 03:35:00,967
按照这个叙述的逻辑 基督是从犹大支派中兴起的

2115
03:35:04,052 --> 03:35:08,910
所以现在 当这一切发生时 拉结就像是自杀般地渴望孩子

2116
03:35:09,010 --> 03:35:15,950
她嫉妒她的姐姐 正如我们指出的那样 虽然利亚相当不受欢迎 但她似乎非常擅长生儿子

2117
03:35:17,391 --> 03:35:23,830
拉结对雅各不满意 所以她斥责了他 雅各基本上说 你想让我做什么

2118
03:35:23,890 --> 03:35:26,867
我又不是上帝 这是一个合理的回应

2119
03:35:26,867 --> 03:35:32,441
我会说 所以在绝望中她将Billa给雅各做妾

2120
03:35:32,441 --> 03:35:34,186
她的婢女

2121
03:35:34,186 --> 03:35:35,590
我们以前见过类似的事情发生过

2122
03:35:39,373 --> 03:35:49,190
Billa生了两个孩子丹（dan）和纳夫（naph） 这就是我详细介绍所有这些儿子的原因 这很重要 因为雅各是以色列的创始人

2123
03:35:50,672 --> 03:35:56,189
他的儿子们是12个部落的创始人 所以这是故事的关键时刻 对吧

2124
03:35:56,532 --> 03:36:00,145
因为他是……的根本族长

2125
03:36:00,991 --> 03:36:06,410
那些与上帝摔跤的人 因为正如我们将看到的 这就是以色列这个名字的意思 他得到了以色列这个名字

2126
03:36:06,912 --> 03:36:12,810
过一会儿你就会明白为什么 但在这种情况下你需要知道这些家谱 因为

2127
03:36:14,113 --> 03:36:16,770
他们在之后发生的一切中扮演着重要的角色

2128
03:36:17,874 --> 03:36:22,243
所以拿弗他利是第二个

2129
03:36:23,973 --> 03:36:30,410
她的名字或他的名字意味着我与我的妹妹摔跤 与她进行了激烈的摔跤并取得了胜利

2130
03:36:31,576 --> 03:36:31,738
所以

2131
03:36:33,153 --> 03:36:35,630
这可以让你看出家庭的紧张气氛

2132
03:36:37,011 --> 03:36:39,416
现在 利亚已经不能生育了

2133
03:36:39,416 --> 03:36:45,829
我猜 她还给了雅各她的女仆悉帕 以跟上她姐姐的步伐

2134
03:36:46,610 --> 03:36:55,370
现在 悉帕为雅各生了两个孩子 所以他把孩子们堆在这里 左、右、中

2135
03:36:56,995 --> 03:37:01,290
其中一个名叫迦得（Gad） 意思是“好运” 另一个名叫亚设（Asher） 意思是“幸福”或“有福”

2136
03:37:02,052 --> 03:37:06,204
于是 姐妹之间的竞争就更加激烈了

2137
03:37:06,204 --> 03:37:08,229
这是一个非常有趣的小故事

2138
03:37:08,550 --> 03:37:14,350
于是 利亚的女儿流便出去寻找风茄

2139
03:37:14,932 --> 03:37:18,968
现在 曼德拉草具有壮阳功效 所以一开始就有点奇怪

2140
03:37:19,410 --> 03:37:21,410
但是 没关系 事情就是这样

2141
03:37:21,812 --> 03:37:23,279
而且 拉结是……

2142
03:37:26,434 --> 03:37:29,988
拉结想要曼德拉草 因为她仍然对生孩子感兴趣

2143
03:37:30,410 --> 03:37:35,487
她与利亚讨价还价 让她与雅各共度一夜 以换取曼德拉草

2144
03:37:36,471 --> 03:37:40,206
结果 更多的儿子出现了

2145
03:37:41,110 --> 03:37:46,406
于是 拉结终于生下了约瑟

2146
03:37:47,810 --> 03:37:56,628
约瑟在《创世记》的最后一个故事中扮演了关键角色 我希望我们能在下一讲中讲到这个故事 然后我们就可以结束《创世记》了

2147
03:37:56,890 --> 03:37:57,879
无论如何 这就是计划

2148
03:37:59,030 --> 03:38:05,250
所以现在 雅各对整个安排并不是很满意 因为他已经在那里工作了 14 年了

2149
03:38:05,711 --> 03:38:15,663
他有两个妻子 这还不错 但是 这笔交易并不完全干净 他并不真正信任拉班 他没有理由这样做

2150
03:38:18,190 --> 03:38:24,068
雅各来之前拉班很穷 雅各却是一个非常能干的人

2151
03:38:24,750 --> 03:38:35,305
于是他告诉拉班 他想离开并回到自己的祖国 他要从羊群中带走有斑点和有斑点的牛、棕色的绵羊和有斑点和有斑点的山羊

2152
03:38:35,670 --> 03:38:37,686
他们属于少数 所以这就是我们的思想

2153
03:38:38,712 --> 03:38:42,528
于是拉班把所有这些动物都从他的羊群中带走了

2154
03:38:43,030 --> 03:38:47,828
于是就有了这样的思想：斑点山羊和棕色绵羊会真正繁殖

2155
03:38:48,591 --> 03:38:56,130
所以 如果你有一只雄性山羊和一只雌性山羊 它们都是斑点的 那么它们将会有斑点的小山羊 这就是理论

2156
03:38:56,154 --> 03:39:04,454
同样的 对于棕色的绵羊也是如此 所以拉班所做的是 他把所有的斑点动物从羊群中带走 给了他的儿子 并且

2157
03:39:04,512 --> 03:39:11,166
他们带着这些动物走了三天的路程 这样雅各就只剩下羊群 但没有这些动物

2158
03:39:11,190 --> 03:39:18,390
现在的思想是 所有新生崽的都将是拉班的 所以拉班基本上是这样安排的

2159
03:39:18,414 --> 03:39:26,914
原则上雅各为他的工作 而且什么都得不到 这是雅各又一次经历了背叛

2160
03:39:26,966 --> 03:39:32,690
上帝似乎还没有停止提醒他过去所做的事情的重要性

2161
03:39:32,871 --> 03:39:36,285
从某种意义上说 这就是这个故事的寓意

2162
03:39:36,285 --> 03:39:38,716
现在 这个故事有一个奇怪的小转折

2163
03:39:38,716 --> 03:39:41,690
所以雅各所做的是一些令人同情的魔法 所以

2164
03:39:42,172 --> 03:39:52,178
当动物发情时 他把有斑点的物体放在它们面前 有斑点的树枝等等 我想是为了提醒它们应该生产什么

2165
03:39:52,178 --> 03:39:53,344
类似的事情

2166
03:39:53,344 --> 03:39:54,027
它有效

2167
03:39:54,027 --> 03:40:00,569
所以所有这些拉班留下的动物疯狂地生出有斑点的动物

2168
03:40:00,569 --> 03:40:00,850
所以

2169
03:40:01,392 --> 03:40:06,750
也就是说 我猜上帝改变了主意 让雅各在这里稍微摆脱了困境

2170
03:40:07,592 --> 03:40:11,222
所以 很快他就变得非常富有

2171
03:40:11,222 --> 03:40:13,950
多牛、婢女、骆驼、驴

2172
03:40:14,472 --> 03:40:18,188
拉班的儿子嫉妒了 拉班很愤怒

2173
03:40:18,188 --> 03:40:24,470
嗯 显然雅各和儿子们之间存在一些竞争 这并不奇怪 拉班玩这个伎俩

2174
03:40:25,011 --> 03:40:30,190
是为了剥夺了雅各的所有财产 但相反的是 他得到的远远超出了他一开始的财产 所以你可以想象

2175
03:40:30,451 --> 03:40:35,770
这有点烦人 所以雅各认为他最好离开那里 所以他告诉拉结和利亚

2176
03:40:37,012 --> 03:40:41,070
并对他们说 我看到你们父亲的脸色对我已不像以前那样了

2177
03:40:42,012 --> 03:40:49,450
但我父亲的上帝一直与我同在 我竭尽全力为你父亲服务 而你父亲欺骗了我 十次改变了我的工资

2178
03:40:50,052 --> 03:40:58,330
但到目前为止 上帝不让他伤害我 如果他这样说：斑点的将是你的报酬 那么所有的牲畜都生出了斑点的

2179
03:40:58,753 --> 03:41:07,430
如果他这样说：条纹的将是你的报酬 那么所有的牲畜都生出了条纹的 因此 上帝已经夺走了你父亲的牲畜 赐给了我

2180
03:41:08,494 --> 03:41:10,229
他们决定偷偷溜走

2181
03:41:11,013 --> 03:41:15,330
他们对拉班的继承权和继承权的缺失感到不满 所以他们偷偷溜走了

2182
03:41:15,970 --> 03:41:26,450
拉结偷走了她父亲家中的偶像 为什么她要这么做并不完全明显 关于她这样做的原因有很多争议 或是为了惩罚他

2183
03:41:27,453 --> 03:41:31,970
或是 带着她祖先的形象离开 你知道 也许她离家出走时感到孤独

2184
03:41:32,552 --> 03:41:36,070
或是 出于怨恨 向他展示那些偶像实际上是无能为力的

2185
03:41:37,034 --> 03:41:41,210
或是 为了保护 阻止她的父亲通过占卜来追踪他们的逃跑路线

2186
03:41:41,210 --> 03:41:53,058
最后一个是最奇怪的 因为这个思想是 拉班会对偶像使用某种仪式 这将帮助他推断他们的逃生路线 然后可以追赶他们

2187
03:41:53,058 --> 03:41:56,134
无论如何 这就是对此的猜测范围

2188
03:41:56,134 --> 03:41:59,810
我觉得这对我来说更像是一种小小的报复行为

2189
03:42:00,812 --> 03:42:07,348
也许夹杂着一点孤独 拉班追赶着他们

2190
03:42:07,348 --> 03:42:11,485
但上帝在梦中告诉他不要伤害雅各

2191
03:42:11,485 --> 03:42:18,640
拉班追上他并责备雅各 说如果他知道他们要离开 他就会举办一场盛大的聚会

2192
03:42:18,640 --> 03:42:20,954
他不想让他们在夜里偷偷溜走

2193
03:42:20,954 --> 03:42:24,071
你无法从故事中判断这是否属实

2194
03:42:24,071 --> 03:42:28,430
而且 我想说 这些人非常粗鲁和冲动

2195
03:42:28,570 --> 03:42:35,630
也许有 50% 的可能性会发生一场屠杀 有50%的可能性会有一个派对 我实际上参加过这样的派对

2196
03:42:36,614 --> 03:42:36,735
所以

2197
03:42:39,031 --> 03:42:48,970
拉班抱怨他的神不见了 雅各说无论谁拥有这些神 他都会杀死他们 而拉结从各方面来看都是一个非常狡猾的角色

2198
03:42:49,690 --> 03:42:57,630
声称她正在月经 她坐在地毯上 下面是所有的偶像

2199
03:42:57,654 --> 03:43:05,654
她不能动 所以他们到处搜索却找不到 她则是在手背后偷偷笑 因为那个狡猾的小策略

2200
03:43:05,654 --> 03:43:15,754
但她没有死 这大概是件好事 所以那个男人检查了一切 检查了营地 但什么也没找到

2201
03:43:15,778 --> 03:43:24,278
他们和解了 所以这是雅各参与的第一次和解

2202
03:43:24,278 --> 03:43:41,478
你会说业债已经偿还了吗 这是思考它的一种方式 所以他因为他的错误行为而受到惩罚 他也许已经吸取了教训

2203
03:43:41,513 --> 03:43:45,589
就他而言 这已经足够好了 他已经足够好了

2204
03:43:45,910 --> 03:44:00,930
他们和解了 然后当他们旅行时接下来发生的事是雅各独自一人 与一个人摔跤 那个人可能是天使 也可能是上帝

2205
03:44:00,954 --> 03:44:08,554
这不太清楚 我们就说是天使吧 直到天亮或者说是上帝

2206
03:44:08,572 --> 03:44:15,290
当他看到自己不能胜过对方时 就触摸了雅各大腿的窝 雅各与他摔跤时大腿的窝就脱臼了

2207
03:44:15,651 --> 03:44:20,730
他说让我在天亮时走 雅各说我不会让你走 除非你祝福我

2208
03:44:21,559 --> 03:44:44,230
天使对他说 你叫什么名字 雅各说 我叫雅各 天使说 你的名字不再叫雅各 雅各意味着篡夺者

2209
03:44:45,470 --> 03:44:52,750
即那种带有狡猾含义的推翻者 （现在你叫）以色列 意味着与上帝成功搏斗或努力的人

2210
03:44:53,634 --> 03:44:57,750
因为作为一位王子 你与上帝和人类拥有力量 并且取得了胜利

2211
03:44:58,272 --> 03:44:59,316
这真是个了不起的故事

2212
03:44:59,316 --> 03:45:02,730
我不知道到底该怎么理解

2213
03:45:03,231 --> 03:45:09,850
显然有象征意义 这就是人类在某种意义上所做的事情

2214
03:45:09,874 --> 03:45:17,574
如果他们在搏斗 我想说他们是在与神性搏斗 甚至是在与神性的概念搏斗

2215
03:45:20,692 --> 03:45:23,810
但问题是他们是否真的胜利了 这有点奇怪 因为

2216
03:45:24,851 --> 03:45:29,130
雅各实际上似乎赢得了这场战斗 或者至少他赢得了足够多的胜利

2217
03:45:29,891 --> 03:45:37,801
以至于无论他与这个神圣人物搏斗的是谁 都愿意为他祝福 我想这也许是对他勇气的证明

2218
03:45:37,801 --> 03:45:39,146
就是这样的

2219
03:45:39,146 --> 03:45:40,350
也许这表明

2220
03:45:41,492 --> 03:45:53,192
他已经为自己的罪孽付出了足够的代价 所以他又回到了道德制高点 但我认为这确实很能说明问题 名字从雅各到以色列的转变

2221
03:45:53,216 --> 03:46:04,816
以色列的意思是与上帝摔跤的人 或者与上帝斗争的人 也许会成功 但也很有趣 他实际上取得了胜利

2222
03:46:04,840 --> 03:46:12,540
你不一定会认为这是一种可能性 特别是考虑到旧约中上帝相当急躁的本性

2223
03:46:12,564 --> 03:46:20,164
你不想惹他太多 但雅各成功地做到了 但更重要的是这个思想

2224
03:46:20,188 --> 03:46:29,488
无论以色列是由什么组成的 也就是说雅各布建立的这片土地实际上是由那些与上帝搏斗的人组成的

2225
03:46:29,511 --> 03:46:35,169
我认为这是一个了不起的思想 因为在我看来 它也揭示了一些问题

2226
03:46:36,133 --> 03:46:43,167
也许在那些日子里 信仰意味着什么 就像我经常认为婚姻是一场摔跤比赛 对吧

2227
03:46:43,167 --> 03:46:46,603
如果你幸运的话 你嫁给的人就是你的对手

2228
03:46:46,603 --> 03:46:51,543
这不完全是……我不认为这完全是……准确地说 这并不平静

2229
03:46:51,543 --> 03:46:54,614
你们中的一些人可能已经注意到了这一点

2230
03:46:54,614 --> 03:47:02,324
但问题是 如果你有一些东西可以对抗 那么它就会增强你的力量

2231
03:47:02,324 --> 03:47:13,570
实际上 与其没有什么可以争斗的 不如拥有争斗的对手更好 所以雅各是一个因这种争斗的必要性而变得更加坚强的人

2232
03:47:13,631 --> 03:47:20,842
这似乎是与上帝或天使的正确关系 即争斗、战斗 对吧

2233
03:47:20,866 --> 03:47:34,066
而不是某种松散的、弱的信仰声明 我的意思是 我不是想在很大程度上贬低它 它只是看起来不像是正确的概念化模式 对吧

2234
03:47:34,142 --> 03:47:36,752
因为人类不是那样的

2235
03:47:36,752 --> 03:47:40,525
我们是 我们是有争议的生物

2236
03:47:40,525 --> 03:47:44,380
在这种情况下 这实际上似乎是得到上帝青睐的事情

2237
03:47:44,380 --> 03:47:56,223
所以 特别是考虑到这实际上是他所说的 嗯 整个选民王国 这个思想是由那些与上帝抗衡的人组成的

2238
03:47:56,223 --> 03:48:09,893
所以 这是一个地狱般的思想 这是肯定的 雅各问他并说请告诉我你的名字 他说为什么你要问名字

2239
03:48:09,917 --> 03:48:18,517
所以那并没有发生 他在那里祝福了雅各 雅各称那个地方为毗努伊勒 因为我面对面见到了上帝

2240
03:48:18,541 --> 03:48:24,841
我的生命得以保全 他经过毗努伊勒时 太阳升起照在他身上 他的大腿受伤 跛行

2241
03:48:24,893 --> 03:48:37,840
现在 雅各确实受伤了 对吧 所以在那之后他就永久跛行了 这也表明这种搏斗实际上是多么危险

2242
03:48:37,840 --> 03:48:41,513
就像 他得到了祝福 他赢了 但他并没有逃脱惩罚

2243
03:48:41,513 --> 03:48:53,172
所以 现在 雅各回到以扫 他很害怕 尽管已经过去了14年 他想也许他那个头脑发热的兄弟还没有平静下来

2244
03:48:53,172 --> 03:48:59,607
我想说 他有充分的理由这么认为

2245
03:48:59,607 --> 03:49:03,562
于是 他派使者去见以扫 以扫带着 400 人出发了

2246
03:49:03,562 --> 03:49:06,676
雅各对即将发生的情况并不乐观

2247
03:49:06,676 --> 03:49:10,514
他把他的人民分成两队 这样也许其中一半就不会被杀死

2248
03:49:10,514 --> 03:49:19,628
然后他从他的大羊群中挑选了一群动物和一群仆人 他派他们出去迎接以扫 基本上是说 看

2249
03:49:20,491 --> 03:49:28,690
我是个混蛋 对整个与生俱来的权利感到抱歉 这里有一些动物 也许

2250
03:49:29,691 --> 03:49:32,601
也许这就是道歉的开始

2251
03:49:32,601 --> 03:49:39,502
类似这样的事情 但他不太相信这实际上会起作用

2252
03:49:40,552 --> 03:49:46,110
事实证明 在这段时间里 以扫实际上已经成熟了 也许这是思考它的一种方式

2253
03:49:47,855 --> 03:49:58,150
以扫遇见雅各并说 只要见到他就足够了 但雅各坚持要他接受礼物 而以扫接受了 这可能是明智的事情 因为

2254
03:49:59,331 --> 03:50:09,650
即使以扫有95%确信 仅仅见到他的兄弟就足够了 可能还有5%的部分真的并不那么高兴 所以你必须小心

2255
03:50:10,073 --> 03:50:21,287
你知道 当你说你原谅某人时 因为可能有你的一部分实际上并没有真正原谅 真正需要其他东西 在你能真正说 好吧 看 没问题之前

2256
03:50:21,287 --> 03:50:33,120
你不想在这一点上欺骗自己 因为尚未完全被说服的那百分之五会在某个时候发出自己的声音 然后可能会破坏整个和解进程

2257
03:50:33,120 --> 03:50:36,736
你不要以为自己比别人强 也不要以为自己比别人好

2258
03:50:36,736 --> 03:50:38,221
这没有帮助

2259
03:50:38,221 --> 03:50:46,088
所以以扫是聪明的 我认为 而雅各也聪明地说 不 不 像是 非常感谢 但还是收下这些该死的山羊 而且

2260
03:50:47,212 --> 03:51:01,259
雅各和以扫足够聪明地接受这个 他可能这样做是为了取悦雅各 但也是 我认为 为了真正有可能建立和平

2261
03:51:01,259 --> 03:51:11,409
因为 假设 所提供的礼物足以消除因失去与生俱来的权利而产生的债务 就像这样

2262
03:51:11,433 --> 03:51:26,633
这是真正债务的偿还 以扫问这一切送来的群畜是什么意思 雅各说这些是为了在我主人面前找到恩典

2263
03:51:26,673 --> 03:51:32,890
以扫说我已经有足够了 兄弟 你保留你自己的吧

2264
03:51:40,714 --> 03:51:48,914
雅各说--这是一个有趣的声明--我认为不 我请求你 如果我现在在你眼前找到了恩典 请接受我手中的礼物

2265
03:51:48,990 --> 03:51:55,094
因此 我看见了你的面容 就好像我看见了上帝的面容一样 现在对我感到满意

2266
03:51:55,094 --> 03:52:04,427
所以 他就是这样 他接受了他兄弟的光荣判决 因为这是光荣的 因为以扫确实被出卖了

2267
03:52:04,427 --> 03:52:07,677
所以他有权利站在审判的立场上

2268
03:52:07,677 --> 03:52:14,238
他将这种审判等同于最高的美德

2269
03:52:14,238 --> 03:52:15,905
这是正确的判断

2270
03:52:15,905 --> 03:52:25,669
所以 他想彻底弥补以扫 好像以扫是正义神圣元素的代表

2271
03:52:25,669 --> 03:52:29,664
而且 我想这对以扫来说是有说服力的

2272
03:52:29,664 --> 03:52:30,610
这是一件很值得说的事

2273
03:52:31,592 --> 03:52:36,089
我需要与你和好 因为这会同时使我与神和好

2274
03:52:36,571 --> 03:52:38,238
就好像 这很关键

2275
03:52:38,238 --> 03:52:48,510
这是我们之间的事情 但是 有一个更高的原则处于危险之中 这很重要 我认为背叛就是这种情况 这种情况很常见 因为如果你背叛了某人 你确实已经侵犯了

2276
03:52:49,631 --> 03:52:50,976
你已经严重侵犯了

2277
03:52:50,976 --> 03:52:53,363
只能称之为神圣的信任

2278
03:52:53,363 --> 03:52:55,650
这是正确的术语 接受它

2279
03:52:55,931 --> 03:53:04,244
我祈祷我的祝福能带给你 因为上帝仁慈地对待我 因为我已经足够了 他恳求他 他接受了它

2280
03:53:05,874 --> 03:53:07,690
所以这个故事似乎是这样的

2281
03:53:09,214 --> 03:53:18,269
好吧 雅各是一个傲慢、狡诈、欺骗的性格 也许对自己的能力印象过于深刻

2282
03:53:18,730 --> 03:53:23,007
他觉得在哥哥面前耍一两个小把戏挺有意思的

2283
03:53:23,730 --> 03:53:30,802
然后他就逃跑了 这可不太勇敢 然后他遭到了很多重击 也许学到了一些东西

2284
03:53:31,410 --> 03:53:33,766
然后当他回来时 他是一个不同的人

2285
03:53:34,430 --> 03:53:35,053
所以这是一个...

2286
03:53:38,930 --> 03:53:40,003
这是一个合理的故事

2287
03:53:40,610 --> 03:53:52,041
他必须彻底悔改自己的所作所为 才能妥善纠正这种情况 而且他愿意这样做

2288
03:53:54,070 --> 03:54:03,130
所以这也是一个有趣的思想 因为它是这个思想的早期反映 如果你过去做错了什么

2289
03:54:03,154 --> 03:54:14,054
A 你可以从中学习 对吧 这样你实际上就有能力学习 B 你可以在当下找到平衡 这些都是非常乐观的思想

2290
03:54:14,078 --> 03:54:24,678
因为你可能会说 一旦你犯下了某种罪行 那就完了 你没有希望了 但这太苛刻了 因为

2291
03:54:24,752 --> 03:54:34,690
你在生活中某个时刻做过不道德的事的概率是百分之百 所以如果之后没有办法纠正这种不平衡 那么每个人都将注定失败

2292
03:54:35,311 --> 03:54:41,083
所以 故事又变得艰难起来

2293
03:54:41,083 --> 03:54:44,550
雅各定居在示勒 或称谢勒

2294
03:54:44,931 --> 03:54:48,125
他的女儿黛娜四处寻找朋友

2295
03:54:48,125 --> 03:54:52,624
哈抹的儿子示剑与她同房 然后想要她为妻

2296
03:54:52,624 --> 03:54:54,491
他实际上把顺序颠倒了

2297
03:54:54,491 --> 03:54:56,659
事实证明这是一个问题

2298
03:54:56,659 --> 03:54:58,566
雅各听说了这件事

2299
03:54:58,566 --> 03:54:59,850
父辈们谈论着

2300
03:55:00,193 --> 03:55:01,709
于是 他们达成协议

2301
03:55:03,571 --> 03:55:14,589
协议是 如果哈默的所有部下 包括哈默和他的儿子 都接受割礼 那么这就是适当的祭品 我想这会让他们融入家族

2302
03:55:15,031 --> 03:55:22,809
并表示他们愿意为此做出牺牲 尤其是在示剑本末倒置之后

2303
03:55:24,393 --> 03:55:26,889
哈默人接受了割礼 他们同意这样做

2304
03:55:27,331 --> 03:55:33,830
事实证明这是一个很大的错误 所以当他们第二天躺在床上 忍受着割礼的痛苦时

2305
03:55:35,410 --> 03:55:40,910
西缅和利未进来了 他们潜入并杀死了所有人 夺走了他们的财富 以及他们的妇女和儿童

2306
03:55:41,676 --> 03:55:42,244
这很暴力

2307
03:55:43,115 --> 03:55:43,579
这很暴力

2308
03:55:46,413 --> 03:55:48,024
是的 我想你们注意到了 嗯

2309
03:55:52,154 --> 03:55:53,890
所以 他们是荣誉社会 对吗

2310
03:55:54,211 --> 03:56:00,450
世界上仍然有很多荣誉社会 因此他们对发生在他们妹妹身上的事情感到不满

2311
03:56:01,094 --> 03:56:02,125
尽管他们没有杀她

2312
03:56:03,074 --> 03:56:03,236
所以

2313
03:56:06,294 --> 03:56:13,430
现在事情变成了这样 在第三天 当他们感到疼痛时 雅各的两个儿子西缅和利未

2314
03:56:14,151 --> 03:56:18,630
底拿的兄弟们各自拿起剑 大胆地来到城中 杀死了所有的男性

2315
03:56:19,372 --> 03:56:24,950
他们用剑杀死了哈抹和他的儿子示剑 将底拿从示剑的家中带出 离开了

2316
03:56:25,912 --> 03:56:30,310
雅各的儿子们来到被杀之人那里 洗劫了城市 因为他们玷污了他们的妹妹

2317
03:56:31,832 --> 03:56:39,330
他们夺取了羊、牛、驴以及城里和田里的一切 所有的财富、所有的孩子和他们的妻子

2318
03:56:40,052 --> 03:56:43,550
他们把他们掳为俘虏 并洗劫了房子里的一切其他东西

2319
03:56:44,292 --> 03:56:50,350
雅各实际上对此并不高兴 因为他已经与哈抹会面 并且他们已经敲定了一项协议

2320
03:56:51,471 --> 03:56:57,190
这就是他们居住的地方 所以他觉得自己是在尽可能地从坏境况中寻找出路

2321
03:56:57,551 --> 03:57:00,630
我们这么说吧 他的儿子们背着他做了事

2322
03:57:01,951 --> 03:57:11,470
雅各对西缅和利未说 你们让我在这片土地上的居民中成了臭名昭著的 我在迦南人和非利士人中成了异类 而且我们人数少

2323
03:57:12,373 --> 03:57:17,990
他们现在会聚集起来攻击我 我会被杀死 我和我的家庭会被毁灭

2324
03:57:19,052 --> 03:57:22,449
他们说 难道他可以像对待妓女那样对待我们的妹妹吗

2325
03:57:25,432 --> 03:57:28,930
上帝对雅各说 这就回到了中心思想

2326
03:57:29,653 --> 03:57:31,869
上帝对雅各说 起来 去伯特利

2327
03:57:33,192 --> 03:57:38,338
在那里居住 所以伯特利是雅各原先立那根柱子的地方 现在又回到了这里

2328
03:57:38,338 --> 03:57:41,290
这确实是一次真正的英雄之旅 对吧

2329
03:57:41,410 --> 03:57:45,020
那里是他有一个固定的地方

2330
03:57:45,020 --> 03:57:49,030
他外出冒险 经历了道德的转变

2331
03:57:50,010 --> 03:57:54,785
和解之后 他作为一个转变了的人回到了同一个地方

2332
03:57:54,785 --> 03:57:56,310
这就是一个完整的英雄循环

2333
03:57:57,391 --> 03:58:01,170
起来 去伯特利 在那里居住 并为那位显现给你的上帝建立一座祭坛

2334
03:58:01,792 --> 03:58:05,009
当你从你兄弟以扫面前逃跑时 他向你显现

2335
03:58:05,892 --> 03:58:11,190
雅各对他的家人和所有与他们同在的人说 把你们中间的外邦神像除掉 并且

2336
03:58:12,452 --> 03:58:16,870
洁净自己 更换衣服 让我们起身上伯特利去

2337
03:58:17,572 --> 03:58:24,124
我要在那里为那位在我困苦之日应允我的上帝建立一座祭坛 他一直与我同在我所走的路上

2338
03:58:25,572 --> 03:58:30,890
他们就把所有的外邦神像和耳环 都交给了雅各 都是他们手中和耳中的

2339
03:58:31,531 --> 03:58:34,530
雅各把它们藏在示剑旁的橡树下 他们就动身前往

2340
03:58:36,033 --> 03:58:40,990
上帝的恐惧降临在他们周围的城市上 他们没有追赶雅各的儿子们

2341
03:58:41,752 --> 03:58:44,566
于是雅各来到迦南地的路斯

2342
03:58:44,566 --> 03:58:48,503
那是伯特利 所以那是他最初立柱子的地方

2343
03:58:48,503 --> 03:58:50,090
他和所有与他在一起的人

2344
03:58:50,633 --> 03:58:53,890
他在那里筑了一座坛 给那地方起名叫伊勒伯特利

2345
03:58:54,392 --> 03:58:57,289
因为当他逃离他哥哥的时候 上帝向他显现了

2346
03:58:58,751 --> 03:59:02,886
当雅各从巴旦亚兰出来时 神再次向他显现并赐福给他

2347
03:59:02,886 --> 03:59:03,990
上帝派人到他那里

2348
03:59:04,893 --> 03:59:13,467
你的名字是雅各 你的名字将不再被称为雅各 你记得意味着篡位者 但以色列将是你的名字

2349
03:59:13,491 --> 03:59:22,291
与上帝摔跤的人 他给他起名叫以色列 上帝对他说 我是全能的上帝 要生养众多 使一个国家繁衍生息

2350
03:59:22,315 --> 03:59:34,415
你将成为一群国家 君王将从你的腰间出来 我将把我赐给亚伯拉罕和以撒的土地赐给你 我还将把这土地赐给你的后裔 ”

2351
03:59:34,467 --> 03:59:37,060
神就从他与他说话的地方升上去了

2352
03:59:37,060 --> 03:59:42,028
雅各在他与他说话的地方立了一根石柱

2353
03:59:42,028 --> 03:59:45,905
又在上面浇奠祭 又浇上油

2354
03:59:45,905 --> 03:59:58,207
雅各给神与他说话的地方起名叫伯特利

2355
03:59:58,207 --> 04:00:05,323
就这样 他回到了原本属于他的领地的中心地带

2356
04:00:05,323 --> 04:00:19,300
拉结在分娩中死去 在生下便俄尼（我悲哀之子）的过程中 其名字后来被改为便雅悯（右手之子）现在是流便

2357
04:00:21,474 --> 04:00:26,417
所以西缅和利未已经做了一些不可原谅的事 现在轮到流便了

2358
04:00:26,417 --> 04:00:27,640
轮到流便了

2359
04:00:27,640 --> 04:00:31,450
他与辟拉同寝 辟拉是雅各（以色列）的妾

2360
04:00:32,051 --> 04:00:37,710
所以他是第三个犯下不可原谅错误的儿子 雅各/以色列得知了此事

2361
04:00:38,195 --> 04:00:39,508
所以流便不再...

2362
04:00:40,433 --> 04:00:45,304
鉴于两个年长的儿子因为他们的不服从和冲动的报复性残忍而被排除在外 他本应成为首要的儿子

2363
04:00:46,092 --> 04:00:53,930
可以这么说 因为他们的不服从而被排除在竞争之外 然后流便不能控制自己

2364
04:00:55,574 --> 04:00:57,470
他们怎么说来着 你明白我的意思吧

2365
04:00:59,552 --> 04:01:03,930
是的 这似乎仍然是相当普遍的事情

2366
04:01:07,216 --> 04:01:14,530
那么我们的故事基本上以以色列 12 个部落的建立而结束

2367
04:01:15,694 --> 04:01:20,030
来自利亚的有流便、西缅、利未、犹大、以萨迦和西布伦

2368
04:01:20,432 --> 04:01:22,200
来自悉帕的有迦得和亚设

2369
04:01:22,200 --> 04:01:24,310
来自辟拉的有但和拿弗他利

2370
04:01:25,032 --> 04:01:34,400
来自拉结的有约瑟 他在我们接下来要讲的故事中占据了极其重要的地位 希望能总结创世记 还有便雅悯

2371
04:01:34,424 --> 04:01:58,424
因此 现在以色列本身已经确立 然后我们转向约瑟的故事 今晚要提前结束 真是个奇迹 故事随后转向约瑟和...

2372
04:01:58,471 --> 04:02:06,789
故事基本上从现在开始 以色列爱约瑟胜过他所有的孩子 因为他是约瑟晚年生下的儿子 他给他做了一件彩色的外套

2373
04:02:08,234 --> 04:02:09,830
所以这似乎在我看来是什么意思

2374
04:02:10,831 --> 04:02:15,784
你知道 梦中的外衣很多时候似乎特别符合女性的梦境

2375
04:02:15,784 --> 04:02:23,708
这是我的临床观察 服装尤其是鞋履象征着一个角色

2376
04:02:24,595 --> 04:02:32,630
这是有道理的 对吧 因为你会根据角色来打扮 这并不是什么大秘密 但那么你可能会问 多彩的外衣意味着什么呢

2377
04:02:34,154 --> 04:02:37,507
如果你想到那里的多样性

2378
04:02:38,272 --> 04:02:42,530
这就像是多个领域的掌握 对吧 或许是类似于多能性

2379
04:02:43,550 --> 04:02:49,510
因此雅各是以色列的最爱 或者说约瑟是以色列的最爱

2380
04:02:50,733 --> 04:02:56,590
因为他在他身上看到了这种多余的可能性 他基本上告诉他的其他儿子

2381
04:02:57,350 --> 04:03:03,410
雅各将成为继承人 这是他们不高兴的 对 因为他本质上只是个年轻的小混混

2382
04:03:03,770 --> 04:03:10,690
而且他明显是他父亲的宠儿 他得到了这件象征更高地位的外衣 因此

2383
04:03:11,692 --> 04:03:27,810
以色列无意中在家庭中引发了大量的兄弟姐妹间的竞争 这也是创世记最后一个故事的基础

2384
04:03:27,990 --> 04:03:32,084
因此 在 2017 年本系列讲座的最后一篇中

2385
04:03:34,693 --> 04:03:44,609
我们将讲述约瑟和他的多种颜色外套的故事 以及由于他父亲对他的偏爱而发生的后果

2386
04:03:45,392 --> 04:03:50,069
我们将跟踪由此发生的情况

2387
04:03:50,670 --> 04:03:54,114
所以 我要到此为止 因为我已经完成了

2388
04:03:54,114 --> 04:03:54,254
所以...

2389
04:03:59,943 --> 04:04:00,872
你好 彼得森博士

2390
04:04:01,821 --> 04:04:05,895
这是我已经思考了很长一段时间的思想

2391
04:04:07,421 --> 04:04:12,399
人类历史上最伟大的智慧源泉

2392
04:04:13,202 --> 04:04:18,359
无论是通过文本、经历还是经文

2393
04:04:18,720 --> 04:04:24,057
似乎总是来自于人们进入孤立然后再返回的过程

2394
04:04:25,020 --> 04:04:29,678
所以从科学的角度或进化的角度

2395
04:04:30,240 --> 04:04:36,438
我一直很难理解 是什么驱使一个以行为为中心

2396
04:04:37,380 --> 04:04:47,477
以生存为中心的生物 特别是对于人类和社会群体 以及繁殖 想要进入孤立

2397
04:04:48,200 --> 04:04:55,220
而且 不仅如此 还能从中获得某种程度的信息 实际上也会帮助团体返回

2398
04:04:56,041 --> 04:04:57,138
这是一个非常好的问题

2399
04:04:58,982 --> 04:04:59,595
可以 然后呢...

2400
04:05:01,620 --> 04:05:05,559
有一位神经科学家、神经心理学家 名叫 L.柯南·戈德堡

2401
04:05:06,881 --> 04:05:09,239
戈德堡是亚历山大·卢里亚的学生

2402
04:05:09,741 --> 04:05:12,419
亚历山大·卢里亚是一位俄罗斯神经心理学家

2403
04:05:13,140 --> 04:05:17,277
也许是 20 世纪中后期最重要的神经心理学家

2404
04:05:18,501 --> 04:05:25,100
例如 他的学生索科洛夫和维诺格拉多娃发现了定向反射

2405
04:05:25,280 --> 04:05:31,120
定向反射是当异常事物干扰你的目标导向行为时为你定向的反射

2406
04:05:31,360 --> 04:05:41,799
这是一项重大发现 就像心理学领域（尤其是神经科学领域）有史以来最重要的四五个发现之一

2407
04:05:42,180 --> 04:05:43,392
所以卢里亚是一件大事

2408
04:05:45,042 --> 04:05:51,840
他也是第一个真正确立前额叶皮层功能作用的人 因此非常高兴

2409
04:05:53,601 --> 04:06:02,152
他的书写于 1980 年 关于大脑如何运作的总体观点 现在仍然有很多内容 这非常有用 这对于科学来说是相当奇怪的

2410
04:06:02,152 --> 04:06:04,200
无论如何 进步得那么快

2411
04:06:05,602 --> 04:06:08,015
因此 戈德堡出身于伟大的血统

2412
04:06:08,015 --> 04:06:13,597
如果我没记错的话 卢里亚的老师是巴甫洛夫

2413
04:06:14,360 --> 04:06:25,559
所以无论如何 戈德堡 你们中的一些人可能听说过这样的思想：

2414
04:06:26,540 --> 04:06:39,240
左半球比右半球更具语言能力 左半球专门用于语言 右半球专门用于非语言意象交流

2415
04:06:39,264 --> 04:06:46,964
左半球具有组织良好的微观结构 右半球也更加分散

2416
04:06:46,988 --> 04:06:59,388
对于左撇子男性尤其如此 因此电路可以稍微切换一下 但没关系 模块基本相同 尽管它们可以移动一点

2417
04:06:59,423 --> 04:07:06,590
但戈德堡认为 这不是语言与非语言的问题 而是常规与新奇的问题

2418
04:07:06,590 --> 04:07:10,160
左半球 有一位神经心理学家

2419
04:07:10,822 --> 04:07:17,565
一位名叫拉马钱德兰（Ramachandran）的医生做了一些与此相关的非常有趣的工作

2420
04:07:17,565 --> 04:07:19,834
也许我会告诉你一个关于他的故事

2421
04:07:19,834 --> 04:07:28,380
总之 戈德堡认为 右半球 所以你有非常古老的系统

2422
04:07:29,043 --> 04:07:37,339
大脑皮层的两个半球都会对异常做出反应 对不合适的东西做出反应 对远处的捕食者做出反应

2423
04:07:37,339 --> 04:07:39,128
其中一些速度非常快

2424
04:07:39,128 --> 04:07:44,838
这就像蛇的反射一样 可以在比蛇咬人更短的时间内让你远离蛇

2425
04:07:44,838 --> 04:07:45,803
这确实是一种条件反射

2426
04:07:45,803 --> 04:07:47,068
甚至在你大脑意识到之前就已经进行反射了

2427
04:07:47,068 --> 04:07:49,138
真的是超级快

2428
04:07:49,138 --> 04:08:01,180
然后 有一种防御性的蹲伏姿态 在神经系统更高处被激活 但这仍然异常迅速 然后有作为情绪的恐惧以及注意力的定向

2429
04:08:01,601 --> 04:08:08,140
接着是认知处理 所有这些在一段时间内展开 对吧 也许这段时间是半秒钟

2430
04:08:08,661 --> 04:08:14,680
所以 如果有东西在攻击你 这真的是很长的一段时间 所以你得到的这些初始反应是相当原始的

2431
04:08:15,204 --> 04:08:16,659
但它们异常快速

2432
04:08:17,662 --> 04:08:26,178
好吧 皮层下结构会引导你去感受新奇事物 并为僵直或行动做好准备

2433
04:08:26,784 --> 04:08:30,016
右半球似乎是由这些系统控制的

2434
04:08:30,582 --> 04:08:34,420
所以 想象一下 发生的事情是有东西在威胁你

2435
04:08:34,683 --> 04:08:36,137
你朝着它的方向

2436
04:08:36,420 --> 04:08:39,329
右半球产生一堆关于它可能是什么的图像

2437
04:08:40,420 --> 04:08:42,420
想象一下当一个孩子害怕黑暗时会发生什么

2438
04:08:43,289 --> 04:08:44,157
孩子在床上

2439
04:08:44,521 --> 04:08:47,895
它们怕黑 蹲着是因为它们像猎物一样被冻僵了、

2440
04:08:48,420 --> 04:08:57,020
他们的右脑正在假想栖息在黑暗中的怪物 这些怪物是孩子对外面世界的假设

2441
04:08:58,286 --> 04:08:58,509
好的

2442
04:08:59,482 --> 04:09:02,840
因为这就是你想知道的 你想知道外面有什么

2443
04:09:03,606 --> 04:09:05,300
然后你想知道该怎么办

2444
04:09:05,882 --> 04:09:12,180
我可以告诉你两个与此相关的孩子的梦想 所以当我女儿大约三岁的时候

2445
04:09:12,924 --> 04:09:25,160
她进入我和妻子的卧室 她在哭 她做了一个噩梦 她说她看到一条小溪 小溪里到处都是垃圾

2446
04:09:26,164 --> 04:09:36,000
她不喜欢这样 所以我让她坐下 我说好吧 所以想象一下里面有垃圾的小溪 现在想象一下你正在把垃圾拿出来扔进垃圾桶

2447
04:09:36,024 --> 04:09:44,924
所以她和我让她喜欢想象这一点 因为这会让她回到半梦状态 然后她清理了乱七八糟的东西 然后她就可以去睡觉了

2448
04:09:44,948 --> 04:09:55,412
现在你可以告诉孩子不要担心 梦是不是真的 那不是真的 因为它不像其他白天的事情那样真实 但它又不像是不真实的

2449
04:09:55,412 --> 04:09:57,379
这是一个梦 就像梦是真实的

2450
04:09:57,801 --> 04:10:02,680
但它并非现实的 所以我对她所做的就是

2451
04:10:03,300 --> 04:10:08,600
实际地向她表明 如果她看到一些异常的东西 一些不合适的东西

2452
04:10:09,382 --> 04:10:13,860
一些乱七八糟的事 她在她的能力范围之内就能解决

2453
04:10:15,124 --> 04:10:22,937
好吧 好吧 现在你的右半球会告诉你黑暗中可能栖息着哪些怪物

2454
04:10:22,961 --> 04:10:31,661
现在你必须做的是弄清楚有两件事你需要解决：一是如何应对一个特定的怪物

2455
04:10:31,664 --> 04:10:38,276
另一个是要解决的是如何应对所有可能怪物的类别

2456
04:10:38,300 --> 04:10:43,900
这是完全不同的事情 只有人类才能达到这种抽象水平 对吧

2457
04:10:44,000 --> 04:10:50,800
所以你对付一个特定怪物的方法可能是隐藏或者出去把它除掉

2458
04:10:50,820 --> 04:10:59,616
如果它仅仅是一只实际的动物的话 但这没有帮助 因为还有所有其他可能的捕食者仍然存在 所以或许你可以去猎杀它们

2459
04:10:59,640 --> 04:11:05,040
但这也没用 因为你不可能全部猎杀完 无论如何这都不太可能

2460
04:11:05,064 --> 04:11:12,564
所以你必须做的是弄清楚如何配置自己 以便当怪物来临时你处于最佳的抵抗位置

2461
04:11:12,616 --> 04:11:13,440
这是你最好的选择

2462
04:11:14,484 --> 04:11:16,720
好吧 现在人们正试图永远解决这个问题

2463
04:11:17,721 --> 04:11:23,280
他们试图弄清楚 所有可能的怪物类别问题的答案是什么

2464
04:11:24,282 --> 04:11:26,050
其中一部分是牺牲

2465
04:11:26,050 --> 04:11:35,360
所以有一些惯例 例如 在印度教中 与女神凯莉一起 你向凯莉供奉 她是吞噬女神

2466
04:11:36,024 --> 04:11:38,500
然后她变成了她的反面 仁慈

2467
04:11:39,061 --> 04:11:51,320
因此 牺牲实际上是驯服怪兽的一种方法 如果你把怪兽看成是所有负的未来潜能的集合 你做出适当的牺牲 那些怪兽就会远离你

2468
04:11:52,162 --> 04:11:57,140
但随后 有作为另一种选择的英雄主义 这意味着

2469
04:11:57,500 --> 04:12:03,380
积极地直面所有可能怪物的类别 并把自己建造成一个有勇气的人 能够做到这一点

2470
04:12:04,162 --> 04:12:19,120
它需要大量的冥想来转化那些怪物的形象 比如说 或者解决那些怪物类别的问题

2471
04:12:19,502 --> 04:12:21,574
所以现在我要告诉你另一个孩子的梦想

2472
04:12:21,598 --> 04:12:34,798
所以你们中的一些人可能以前听说过这个 但这是一个伟大的梦想 值得讲述 所以现在有一次在我嫂子的家里 她的儿子到处乱跑

2473
04:12:34,874 --> 04:12:40,798
他大约四岁 非常早熟 非常善于表达 非常聪明

2474
04:12:40,798 --> 04:12:43,890
戴着骑士帽 拿着剑到处乱跑

2475
04:12:43,890 --> 04:12:46,540
所以他沉浸在这个非常激烈的游戏世界中

2476
04:12:47,324 --> 04:12:51,845
当他睡觉时 他把骑士帽放在枕头上 把剑放在枕头边

2477
04:12:51,845 --> 04:12:55,177
与此同时 他也有夜惊症

2478
04:12:55,177 --> 04:12:55,900
所以他时常惊醒

2479
04:12:56,322 --> 04:12:57,827
并且已经持续了好几个星期了

2480
04:12:57,827 --> 04:13:00,517
内特尖叫着醒来

2481
04:13:00,517 --> 04:13:12,679
然后 但他不知道为什么家里有些事情进展得不是很顺利 父母不久后就离婚了 好吧 所以这就是潜在的情况 对吧

2482
04:13:12,703 --> 04:13:17,603
他也要去幼儿园了 所以他即将走向这个世界

2483
04:13:17,627 --> 04:13:31,727
所以他正在应对这个问题 所以那晚我看着他四处走动 觉得这很酷 那天晚上他醒来并尖叫

2484
04:13:31,740 --> 04:13:39,000
第二天早上我们都在吃早餐 我说你做了什么梦吗 他变得非常紧张

2485
04:13:39,024 --> 04:13:51,024
他说是的 我做了一个梦 我问那梦见了什么 他说我在这个田野上 然后所有这些像矮人一样的生物走了过来

2486
04:13:51,061 --> 04:13:55,256
它们只有我膝盖那么高 而且它们没有手臂

2487
04:13:55,256 --> 04:14:04,840
它们有强壮的腿 身上覆盖着像是毛茸茸的羽毛和油脂 头顶上刻着十字架 而且它们有喙

2488
04:14:06,662 --> 04:14:09,720
每当他移动时 它们会用喙向他跳扑

2489
04:14:10,322 --> 04:14:14,779
而且它们有很多 早餐时每个人都什么都没说

2490
04:14:14,779 --> 04:14:15,120
就像是

2491
04:14:17,250 --> 04:14:19,339
因为那时他正深入这个故事 是吧

2492
04:14:19,842 --> 04:14:23,440
所以我们都像是 是啊 这就解释了所有的尖叫声

2493
04:14:24,142 --> 04:14:29,400
然后 他说 是的 然后在背景中有一条龙

2494
04:14:30,463 --> 04:14:36,499
每当龙吐出烟雾时 它们就会变成这些矮人

2495
04:14:37,445 --> 04:14:39,900
就像是 哦 伙计 你真的有问题了

2496
04:14:40,001 --> 04:14:42,660
你得到了 你得到了咬你的东西

2497
04:14:43,463 --> 04:14:53,960
你可以杀死它们 这很好 但然后还有龙 不断地吐出新的 所以这就像是九头蛇问题 对吧 老九头蛇是那条蛇 你切掉一个头 就会长出七个更多

2498
04:14:53,984 --> 04:15:02,084
这不是好事 而且这是一个很酷的梦 因为它真的描绘了所有可能怪物的问题

2499
04:15:02,108 --> 04:15:06,908
所以你有具体的怪物 这是一个问题 所以你得摆脱它们

2500
04:15:06,908 --> 04:15:12,708
但那不是问题 问题是有些东西在背景中 就像疯了一样不断生成怪物

2501
04:15:12,732 --> 04:15:17,532
所以我对他说你认为你能对此做些什么

2502
04:15:17,556 --> 04:15:26,056
这是一个充满暗示的问题 对吧 这就像在审判中引导证人 你不能问这样的问题 因为它暗示了

2503
04:15:26,081 --> 04:15:35,100
这暗示了答案 你能对此做些什么并不比说你可以对此做些什么不同 对吧

2504
04:15:35,124 --> 04:15:43,124
所以我暗示这是一种可能性 他的眼睛亮了起来 现在你记住他已经以骑士的身份奔跑了 嘿

2505
04:15:43,148 --> 04:15:50,348
所以他已经知道该怎么做 因为他有整套剑和帽子 有了那些 你知道你可以去追杀龙

2506
04:15:50,372 --> 04:15:57,872
他明白了这一点 他说我会叫上我爸爸 然后我跳上龙的背上

2507
04:15:57,882 --> 04:16:05,340
我会用我的剑刺瞎它的双眼 然后直接冲进它的喉咙到发火的地方

2508
04:16:05,364 --> 04:16:16,664
我会切出一块发火的部位 然后我会用那作为盾牌 我想对 对 伙计

2509
04:16:16,742 --> 04:16:21,578
这太聪明了 因为他立刻就明白了 他知道了

2510
04:16:22,161 --> 04:16:25,220
首先想象他想好了 我必须直面问题的核心

2511
04:16:25,802 --> 04:16:33,977
对 真正到达核心 不是龙 而是直接冲进那该死东西的喉咙 直到火被创造的地方

2512
04:16:34,001 --> 04:16:42,201
因为在那里 你可以找到盾牌 他会拿这个防火的东西做成盾牌

2513
04:16:42,225 --> 04:16:51,625
所以这简直完美无瑕 太酷了 你会想一个孩子怎么能想出这个 有很多答案 我是说一个是

2514
04:16:51,649 --> 04:16:56,549
我们知道对蛇的恐惧是天生的 我们现在知道了 最近的研究表明了那个那个

2515
04:16:56,640 --> 04:17:02,788
已经证明了这一点 好吧 而且我们已经被捕食和成为捕食者很长一段时间了

2516
04:17:02,788 --> 04:17:05,480
所以这个思想 我发现了其他东西

2517
04:17:05,801 --> 04:17:12,977
关于大脑的有趣内容 最近我也在读雷·库兹韦尔（Ray Kurzweil）写的一本名为《如何构建思维》（How to Build a Mind）的书

2518
04:17:12,977 --> 04:17:13,962
我想这就是它的名字

2519
04:17:13,962 --> 04:17:15,508
这是一本相当不错的书

2520
04:17:15,508 --> 04:17:20,191
所以我认为那是在那本书中 或者是我正在读的一篇神经科学论文中

2521
04:17:20,191 --> 04:17:22,805
这不重要 重要的是它就在这两个地方之一

2522
04:17:22,805 --> 04:17:28,355
你知道最近几年扫描技术的分辨率越来越高了吧

2523
04:17:28,355 --> 04:17:37,117
它的分辨率一直在变得越来越高 所以人们现在能够以一种以前不可能的方式观察大脑的微观结构

2524
04:17:37,141 --> 04:17:47,141
因此 关于皮质的旧思想基本上是 皮质充满了一堆神经元 然后当一个神经元和另一个神经元同时放电时 它们就会连接在一起

2525
04:17:47,180 --> 04:17:49,774
这就是你的大脑学会建立联系的方式

2526
04:17:50,780 --> 04:17:52,737
比这稍微复杂一点 但是就这样了

2527
04:17:53,120 --> 04:18:04,618
然后我们发现事情没那么简单 因为你的皮层是由这些重复的神经元柱组成的 有点像蜈蚣的腿

2528
04:18:05,260 --> 04:18:09,960
给蜈蚣添加另一组腿是非常简单的遗传密码

2529
04:18:10,282 --> 04:18:12,898
这有点像你的大脑 它是由所有这些柱子组成的

2530
04:18:13,300 --> 04:18:16,638
而且柱子基本上已经连接好了

2531
04:18:17,201 --> 04:18:19,678
然后 当您学习时 这些柱子将连接在一起

2532
04:18:20,342 --> 04:18:25,513
好吧 那里有一些预先存在的结构 但是预先存在的结构比想象的要多

2533
04:18:26,220 --> 04:18:41,397
所以基本上是 大脑不同部分的柱已经通过轨道连接在一起 而这些柱本身可以向这些高速通道伸出树突

2534
04:18:42,500 --> 04:18:49,539
这些高速通道已经存在 然后高速通道就在那里 然后它可以生成与高速通道末端的柱的连接

2535
04:18:49,620 --> 04:18:54,238
所以这意味着大量的皮质结构已经就位

2536
04:18:54,660 --> 04:19:00,400
周围有可塑性 当我读到它时 我认为这是原型来源的一部分 那里已经有一个原型结构

2537
04:19:00,922 --> 04:19:12,520
以及皮层下结构 所以你可以说 就像那个孩子一样 他的内心不仅有能力代表怪物

2538
04:19:12,544 --> 04:19:19,944
以及有所有可能的怪物的类别 以及问题不在于怪物 而在于怪物可以不断产生的事实

2539
04:19:20,002 --> 04:19:29,160
这是一个更糟糕的问题 答案不是杀死单个怪物 而是找到怪物本身的源头并击败它

2540
04:19:29,962 --> 04:19:35,160
所以这绝对是令人震惊的 你可以想象这需要付出巨大的冥想努力

2541
04:19:35,762 --> 04:19:39,160
人们在很长一段时间内想出了这个解决方案

2542
04:19:40,167 --> 04:19:40,309
所以

2543
04:19:41,421 --> 04:19:52,200
现在 表示的重点是描绘出威胁是什么 以便您可以制定通用的通用解决方案

2544
04:19:52,962 --> 04:20:00,180
所以 这就是卡莉的形象 我真的很喜欢 因为卡莉有点像黑暗女神 可以说 还有毁灭女神

2545
04:20:00,220 --> 04:20:09,899
所以卡莉 嗯 她有一个火头饰 她的头发着火了 她有一个头骨头饰 她脖子上的手都被砍掉了

2546
04:20:10,300 --> 04:20:19,180
她有一条腰带 通常是蛇 但有时 她有时会吃她刚生下的这个家伙的肠子 而她就坐在这个家伙身上

2547
04:20:19,320 --> 04:20:26,000
她像蜘蛛一样有八条腿 而且她处于火网中 所以她在某种意义上是一个怪物 代表着

2548
04:20:27,080 --> 04:20:30,092
一切可能让你恐惧并吞噬你的东西

2549
04:20:30,092 --> 04:20:37,880
问题是 所以你想出了这个图像来表示所有可怕事物的类别 然后你必须

2550
04:20:38,160 --> 04:20:42,500
生成一个面对她的解决办法 牺牲就是解决办法之一

2551
04:20:42,962 --> 04:20:47,360
这种英雄式的相遇是另一种解决方案 而这就是他所解决的问题

2552
04:20:48,223 --> 04:20:52,680
现在他读了很多书 看了很多迪士尼电影

2553
04:20:53,222 --> 04:20:58,300
他见过很多地方描绘的英雄图案

2554
04:20:58,621 --> 04:21:08,037
他的小脑袋疯狂地工作着 试图提取那件事的本质并具体化它 当我问他那个问题时 一切都咔嚓一声到位了

2555
04:21:08,061 --> 04:21:18,361
所有的事情都排列好了 他的夜惊症就消失了 就这样 并且我后来还跟他妈妈联系 因为这整个事件确实非常不寻常

2556
04:21:18,400 --> 04:21:22,895
那天晚上他并没有出现夜惊 尽管他每晚都会出现夜惊 而那次夜惊就这样结束了

2557
04:21:23,400 --> 04:21:29,713
因为他已经解决了他的问题 就像他需要成为追赶巨龙的勇敢骑士一样

2558
04:21:30,200 --> 04:21:32,192
这就是人们需要成为的样子

2559
04:21:33,740 --> 04:21:48,880
所以我认为当我们进入独处时 我们会关闭外部刺激 让我们头脑中做梦的部分出现 这就是这个非语言模式探测器

2560
04:21:49,281 --> 04:21:56,897
它以图像的方式思考 它是在我们不理解的东西和我们确实理解的东西之间进行调解的东西

2561
04:21:56,921 --> 04:22:07,521
就像如果你完全理解它 你可以说出来 如果你不理解它 你可以把它表现出来 你用图像来表示它 这就像是情感恐惧

2562
04:22:07,522 --> 04:22:13,199
戒断麻痹 然后以可能是什么的形象表现出来

2563
04:22:13,223 --> 04:22:24,123
这个图像是故事的基础 也是进一步发展这个思想的基础 而进入孤立状态就是让这些图像浮现出来并做一点梦想

2564
04:22:24,147 --> 04:22:28,547
然后这会触动你 推动你走向未来

2565
04:22:28,571 --> 04:22:41,171
因此 要使用他们之前使用的语言 仅仅绘制出您面前迫在眉睫的危险是不够的 而是您可以以抽象形式提出的所有潜在危险

2566
04:22:41,200 --> 04:22:53,920
是的 请记住 当上帝将亚当和夏娃赶出天堂时 他们意识到自己将要死去 未来就成了一个问题

2567
04:22:53,944 --> 04:23:01,544
因为你可以说未来是所有潜在怪物的地方 所以只有你摆脱了你面前的怪物

2568
04:23:01,568 --> 04:23:08,068
但这并不能解决你的问题 不是吗 问题是你如何在一个充满怪物的世界中存在

2569
04:23:08,092 --> 04:23:11,992
这个答案的一部分是 将你自己变成一个怪物

2570
04:23:12,044 --> 04:23:13,520
这是答案的很大一部分

2571
04:23:13,941 --> 04:23:18,980
但这是一个不完整的答案 因为如果你只是一个怪物 那么你就和怪物一样坏

2572
04:23:19,682 --> 04:23:27,080
所以 你必须精神恍惚 你必须是一个足以与怪物抗衡的怪物 但你又必须足够文明 这样你自己才不会成为怪

2573
04:23:27,562 --> 04:23:31,820
这或多或少相当于阴影的结构性组合和整合

2574
04:23:32,945 --> 04:23:33,087
所以

2575
04:23:34,520 --> 04:23:43,666
是的 是的

2576
04:23:43,666 --> 04:23:44,787
嗨 彼得森 博士

2577
04:23:44,787 --> 04:23:49,110
自从我开始看你的讲座以来 我一直想问你这个问题

2578
04:23:50,251 --> 04:23:54,103
当我开始读尼采的《善恶的彼岸》之后

2579
04:23:54,103 --> 04:23:56,270
我在他的书中看到一段话

2580
04:23:57,691 --> 04:24:00,644
关于学者的那一章真的非常困扰我

2581
04:24:00,644 --> 04:24:02,030
事实上直到今天还困扰着我

2582
04:24:03,313 --> 04:24:06,370
他谈到这种人 就像他们只是一面镜子

2583
04:24:07,394 --> 04:24:14,929
就像他们伸展 他说他们几乎将每一寸皮肤都伸展开 以容纳他们吸收的每一个新信息

2584
04:24:14,953 --> 04:24:23,953
他们所成为的 只不过是一个工具 他们只是一面镜子 反射他们所学到的 从未真正自主创造过任何东西 这

2585
04:24:23,977 --> 04:24:34,577
这困扰我是因为我感觉在某种程度上它很像是它很大程度上影响了我的身份 因为我不知道你应该怎样去创造某些东西 你

2586
04:24:34,693 --> 04:24:37,280
好吧 那还行 那是个非常好的问题

2587
04:24:37,280 --> 04:24:40,950
我的意思是 尼采常常与存在主义者并列 对吗

2588
04:24:41,131 --> 04:24:45,750
因此 存在主义的两个真正原则之一

2589
04:24:46,792 --> 04:24:51,690
当然还有更多 但显然我们在简化 但一个是 生命是一个问题

2590
04:24:52,774 --> 04:24:54,570
这不是因为你有什么不对

2591
04:24:55,675 --> 04:24:57,050
是生命本身就是一个问题

2592
04:24:57,632 --> 04:25:07,990
因此 这常常与弗洛伊德的观点形成对比 弗洛伊德认为如果你有问题 那是因为你在成长过程中出了问题 存在主义者说不 不 就像是

2593
04:25:09,113 --> 04:25:11,269
生命就是一个问题 毫无疑问 而且

2594
04:25:12,350 --> 04:25:21,960
学问的目的

2595
04:25:24,122 --> 04:25:27,639
学问的目的在某种意义上是为了解决那个问题 而且

2596
04:25:29,061 --> 04:25:34,720
所以对于尼采来说 就像他说所有真理对我来说都是血淋淋的真理 他的意思是

2597
04:25:35,863 --> 04:25:38,859
如果一个思想没有在你身上体现出来

2598
04:25:39,522 --> 04:25:44,284
转变你的观念和你的行动 那么你只是被这个思想占据了

2599
04:25:44,284 --> 04:25:46,976
你仅仅是这个思想的代言人

2600
04:25:46,976 --> 04:25:49,204
或者你可以说这个思想占据了你

2601
04:25:49,204 --> 04:25:51,572
你是这个思想的傀儡

2602
04:25:51,572 --> 04:25:52,355
不是你

2603
04:25:52,355 --> 04:25:56,069
这个思想在你心中 它占有你

2604
04:25:56,069 --> 04:26:00,809
你还没有接受这个思想并将其融入你并使其成为你生活的一部分

2605
04:26:00,809 --> 04:26:03,963
所以有一种与之相关的浪漫主义 对吗

2606
04:26:03,963 --> 04:26:19,856
这就是充满激情的学者 对他来说 思想不仅仅是……它们不仅仅是你所说的可以像商品一样被扔掉的抽象表征

2607
04:26:19,856 --> 04:26:23,014
他们……他们……他们更像……他们更像个性

2608
04:26:23,014 --> 04:26:23,840
这可能是另一种方式

2609
04:26:24,141 --> 04:26:25,485
思考它

2610
04:26:25,485 --> 04:26:30,579
所以如果你...如果...如果这些思想令人信服 那么你

2611
04:26:31,020 --> 04:26:38,024
不要...就像我很久以前学到的一件事 我认为这可能是相关的

2612
04:26:38,024 --> 04:26:45,872
当我还是个孩子的时候 我喜欢争论 我喜欢赢得争论或输掉争论 尽管我更喜欢赢得他们

2613
04:26:45,872 --> 04:26:50,430
但我不太介意争论的内容是什么

2614
04:26:50,430 --> 04:26:53,440
我可以像打擂台一样参与其中

2615
04:26:54,123 --> 04:26:57,056
从某种意义上来说是为了确立统治地位 对吗

2616
04:26:57,056 --> 04:26:58,762
确立智力主导地位

2617
04:26:58,762 --> 04:27:06,754
当我二十多岁的时候 我不再这样做了 因为我认为这种方法太肤浅了

2618
04:27:07,800 --> 04:27:11,154
它们不是那种商品

2619
04:27:12,700 --> 04:27:15,618
它们的卷须可以深入到生命体中

2620
04:27:15,880 --> 04:27:17,113
这是正确的思考方式

2621
04:27:17,740 --> 04:27:23,265
因此 尼采对学者的批评——他也经常这样做——是 他们是不流血的

2622
04:27:24,020 --> 04:27:24,568
他们没有...

2623
04:27:25,320 --> 04:27:27,378
他们充满了表演上的矛盾

2624
04:27:27,580 --> 04:27:28,739
这是另一种思考方式

2625
04:27:28,800 --> 04:27:33,767
他们说一套做一套 因为他们的理智与他们的行为完全脱节

2626
04:27:35,641 --> 04:27:38,577
他认为这是一个非常糟糕的主意

2627
04:27:39,180 --> 04:27:41,878
我认为这是一个很好的批评

2628
04:27:42,221 --> 04:27:43,300
我认为这是一个坏主意

2629
04:27:43,360 --> 04:27:46,396
我还认为这会让讲师变得非常无聊

2630
04:27:47,100 --> 04:27:53,675
因为你可以判断你是否在听某人讲话 你所听到的思想是否只是通过这个人传递的

2631
04:27:53,699 --> 04:28:00,299
比如说 就好像它们被记住了 或者它们是否是人的动力核心的一部分

2632
04:28:00,362 --> 04:28:04,840
如果它们是这个人动力核心的一部分 那么它们几乎总是具有吸引力和吸引力

2633
04:28:05,621 --> 04:28:10,960
所以他不喜欢不流血的学者 我认为这是正确的 因为我看到的一件事

2634
04:28:13,023 --> 04:28:15,260
让思想占据你并不是一个好主意

2635
04:28:17,423 --> 04:28:19,280
除非你知道这些思想的目的是什么

2636
04:28:20,121 --> 04:28:28,578
很多人被思想所占据 而不是拥有它们 这意味着他们没有接受这些思想并将其融入到自己的存在中

2637
04:28:29,363 --> 04:28:32,440
他们没有……从某种意义上说 这就像一个化身

2638
04:28:32,520 --> 04:28:36,419
他们还没有将这些思想具体化

2639
04:28:37,506 --> 04:28:39,118
所以它们是不完整的

2640
04:28:39,982 --> 04:28:44,479
尼采也是如此 查拉图斯特拉如此说道 当查拉图斯特拉下山时

2641
04:28:45,021 --> 04:28:50,300
他看到一群人聚集在一个名人周围 我想也许是一位学者 但这并不重要

2642
04:28:50,641 --> 04:28:55,819
当查拉图斯特拉去看这个人时 他看到的只是一个长着巨大耳朵的小侏儒

2643
04:28:56,885 --> 04:28:58,779
所以他是一位超级专家 对吗

2644
04:28:59,161 --> 04:29:02,159
所以他有一双令人印象深刻的耳朵 但他只有这么大

2645
04:29:02,802 --> 04:29:07,220
这就是尼采对超专业化危险的形象化评论

2646
04:29:07,782 --> 04:29:10,939
还有对超专业化的奉承的危险

2647
04:29:11,542 --> 04:29:14,339
而且 而且 因为他认为这是一种畸形

2648
04:29:15,324 --> 04:29:17,838
现在 尼采是一个非常严厉的人 但是 嗯......

2649
04:29:20,783 --> 04:29:23,398
但他确实谈到了两者之间的关系问题

2650
04:29:24,161 --> 04:29:30,760
智力知识和行动 因为对于尼采来说 这些东西在某种意义上是不可分割的

2651
04:29:31,866 --> 04:29:31,987
所以

2652
04:29:33,342 --> 04:29:36,480
是的 所以也许我不知道为什么它会让你困扰

2653
04:29:38,181 --> 04:29:43,520
就像很难说为什么它会让你困扰 它可能会让你困扰 因为它在某种程度上削弱了学者的概念

2654
04:29:44,182 --> 04:29:53,200
但另一种可能性 并不是指责 因为显然我对你一无所知 但它也可能是因为它触动了你的某些弦 你知道 也许你有所怀疑

2655
04:29:54,261 --> 04:30:06,342
质疑你的智力追求与你实际的性格和实践有多紧密相关

2656
04:30:06,366 --> 04:30:13,466
所以那是另一种可能性 我的意思是 这是一个值得思考的好事情 因为一般来说 这种整合是非常缺乏的

2657
04:30:13,490 --> 04:30:22,890
人们在思想上要比在道德上和在一致性以及正直性上表现得更聪明、更流畅

2658
04:30:22,942 --> 04:30:34,536
所以 是的

2659
04:30:34,536 --> 04:30:42,920
嘿 上周你谈到你如何讨厌人们问你 是否相信上帝或你是否相信奇迹 或者至少你不喜欢这些问题

2660
04:30:42,944 --> 04:30:49,044
但你也谈到了如何 我不想把话说得太满 但我认为你说了一些关于经验证据的思想

2661
04:30:49,081 --> 04:30:58,900
对于宗教体验或精神体验 我想知道这两个思想如何在没有上帝的情况下存在精神存在或精神体验

2662
04:30:59,464 --> 04:31:01,439
或者 我是怎么拥有的 谁知道呢

2663
04:31:02,762 --> 04:31:04,411
谁知道吗

2664
04:31:04,411 --> 04:31:06,300
我不知道 我不知道该怎么做

2665
04:31:06,581 --> 04:31:10,138
我的意思是你可以这取决于你愿意接受什么作为证据

2666
04:31:10,138 --> 04:31:10,520
我想

2667
04:31:11,522 --> 04:31:13,429
这就是事情变得棘手的地方

2668
04:31:13,429 --> 04:31:16,179
你是否必须证明上帝的存在

2669
04:31:16,780 --> 04:31:20,860
客观而言 超越的主观体验是无关紧要的

2670
04:31:21,844 --> 04:31:33,120
如果你最初的预设是唯一实际存在的东西是那些可以客观证明的东西 那么这是一个完全合理的立场

2671
04:31:33,144 --> 04:31:43,844
我并不是说这是一种强大的方法论 我们的技术基本上取决于对这些公理的接受 至少是部分接受

2672
04:31:43,943 --> 04:31:54,959
但我也认为我很难否认这些似乎跨文化的思维模式的存在

2673
04:31:56,003 --> 04:31:59,280
例如龙的表征的存在

2674
04:31:59,862 --> 04:32:05,340
特别是考虑到我可以看到这些表征的出现的进化原理

2675
04:32:06,703 --> 04:32:17,360
所以 还有一个无可争议的事实是 人们可以通过多种不同的途径获得宗教体验

2676
04:32:18,323 --> 04:32:27,698
现在 我之前讨论这个问题时提到的一件事是 你可以说 这些与精神病理学的经历没有什么不同

2677
04:32:28,340 --> 04:32:37,377
但它们是不同的 因为精神病理学的经历会伤害人 而证据表明超验的经历实际上会帮助人

2678
04:32:38,462 --> 04:32:47,478
因此 除非你愿意说 嗯 有些形式的精神病理学体验实际上有利于健康 这是有可能的 但

2679
04:32:47,561 --> 04:32:51,459
我认为你当时正在推动你的假设

2680
04:32:51,481 --> 04:32:54,559
那么 在这种情况下定义什么是宗教体验会有害吗

2681
04:32:54,700 --> 04:32:56,579
因为我觉得语义...

2682
04:32:56,700 --> 04:33:00,795
就像 我不确定你所说的宗教经历是否是我所理解的

2683
04:33:02,120 --> 04:33:08,575
一般来说 宗教体验类似于对世界的更新的体验

2684
04:33:08,900 --> 04:33:18,880
可能是一种思考方式 这样一切都会像晶莹剔透、完美无瑕 仿佛您以前是戴着面具观看的一样

2685
04:33:19,842 --> 04:33:23,320
另一个是万物结合的感觉

2686
04:33:24,401 --> 04:33:29,053
因此 你是一个独特的存在 你是孤立的 并且在宗教经历中如此

2687
04:33:29,053 --> 04:33:31,680
一位神经科学家最近写了一本书

2688
04:33:36,124 --> 04:33:36,569
它叫什么

2689
04:33:38,081 --> 04:33:44,540
我的洞察力 是的 没错 如果我没记错的话 她患有左半球中风

2690
04:33:45,704 --> 04:33:55,259
她是一个高水平的神经科学家 能够理解她中风时发生了什么

2691
04:33:56,021 --> 04:33:59,080
而且她有一个由此产生的强烈的宗教体验

2692
04:34:00,161 --> 04:34:05,520
她将其体验为自我消解 进入与一切事物结合的状态

2693
04:34:06,182 --> 04:34:16,520
超然的敬畏体验和敞开的井 我不记得其余的了 我的意思是宗教体验中还有其他一些很常见的元素 比如打开天堂的思想

2694
04:34:17,061 --> 04:34:19,689
这就是与祖先的交流之一

2695
04:34:19,689 --> 04:34:23,160
这又是一次将身体简化为骷髅

2696
04:34:23,642 --> 04:34:27,600
这是另一个进入天堂的运动 就像这些有据可查的那样

2697
04:34:28,520 --> 04:34:30,520
现象和很多都是相关的

2698
04:34:31,523 --> 04:34:37,219
嗯 其中相当一部分与迷幻剂的使用有关 但这并不是获得此类体验的唯一途径

2699
04:34:37,641 --> 04:34:40,117
癫痫症也会产生类似的经历

2700
04:34:40,681 --> 04:34:43,520
人们通常也会报告濒死体验

2701
04:34:43,620 --> 04:34:49,058
人们通常认为这些经历具有改变人生的意义

2702
04:34:49,721 --> 04:34:57,139
现在 这本身只能证明人们有能力拥有主观的宗教体验 对吗

2703
04:34:58,082 --> 04:35:02,393
它并不能明确证明除此之外还有什么

2704
04:35:02,393 --> 04:35:06,931
所以荣格 例如卡尔荣格 大多数时候他不谈论上帝

2705
04:35:06,931 --> 04:35:08,520
他谈到了上帝的形象

2706
04:35:09,402 --> 04:35:13,740
这不是一回事 因为你可以有一个上帝的形象 它甚至是进化中的实例

2707
04:35:14,320 --> 04:35:22,155
而不一定与任何超越形象的存在有关 对吗

2708
04:35:22,155 --> 04:35:22,195
所以

2709
04:35:24,204 --> 04:35:25,133
谁知道

2710
04:35:25,133 --> 04:35:25,598
谁知道

2711
04:35:27,365 --> 04:35:31,519
再说一次 我认为这取决于你愿意接受什么作为证据

2712
04:35:32,061 --> 04:35:38,780
现在 毫无疑问的证据表明人们可以拥有改变生活的宗教经历

2713
04:35:39,262 --> 04:35:44,338
另一个例子是 治疗酗酒的最佳方法是皈依宗教

2714
04:35:45,102 --> 04:35:48,519
文献中有详细记载 我研究酗酒很长时间

2715
04:35:48,981 --> 04:35:52,740
因此 持久的治疗方法之一就是皈依宗教

2716
04:35:52,820 --> 04:35:57,620
皈依和十二步计划本质上是试图实例化宗教皈依

2717
04:35:58,901 --> 04:36:08,160
很难记录他们的成功 因为坚持下去的人就会成功 但这并不是一个很好的衡量标准

2718
04:36:09,240 --> 04:36:11,499
不言而喻 它们对坚持的人有用

2719
04:36:12,142 --> 04:36:17,559
我并不是对匿名酗酒者或其他什么人愤世嫉俗 但我们没有关于结果的可靠数据

2720
04:36:17,583 --> 04:36:24,883
但是 有充分的数据表明 宗教转变是治疗酗酒的良药

2721
04:36:24,924 --> 04:36:27,159
所以 这也是一个有趣的现象

2722
04:36:28,403 --> 04:36:35,538
嗯 太复杂了 我可能做不到

2723
04:36:38,765 --> 04:36:40,179
好的 我会尝试一下

2724
04:36:40,280 --> 04:36:42,898
我认为宗教皈依可能是这样运作的

2725
04:36:43,842 --> 04:36:48,979
所以想象一下你的左半脑 它是你习惯性解释所在的地方

2726
04:36:49,925 --> 04:36:52,240
所以 我可以给你一个简单的例子

2727
04:36:52,480 --> 04:37:01,739
所以 拉马钱德兰这个人 他是一名神经生理学家 或者我认为这是他的研究领域 我认为他在加州大学洛杉矶分校

2728
04:37:02,622 --> 04:37:07,240
他研究了那些被忽视的人 而忽视是一种非常非常奇怪的现象

2729
04:37:08,022 --> 04:37:14,059
因此 如果你的右顶叶中风受损 你就会失去你的左半身

2730
04:37:14,501 --> 04:37:20,220
不仅仅是你的身体 这真的很奇怪 就像 举个例子 如果你右顶叶中风

2731
04:37:20,762 --> 04:37:25,720
当你看钟表时 你只能看到钟表的一半 对你来说只有半个钟表存在

2732
04:37:26,141 --> 04:37:28,228
这不是说你只能看到钟表的一半

2733
04:37:28,228 --> 04:37:29,251
这比那更奇怪

2734
04:37:29,251 --> 04:37:32,080
就是只有钟表的右半边

2735
04:37:32,462 --> 04:37:33,830
只有你的右半边

2736
04:37:33,830 --> 04:37:35,640
只有我的身体的右半边

2737
04:37:36,262 --> 04:37:41,680
我不知道这边存在 所以有时候右顶叶损伤的人醒来

2738
04:37:42,261 --> 04:37:47,739
中风后会抓起他们的左手臂把它扔出床外 或者是腿 把它扔出床外

2739
04:37:47,763 --> 04:37:53,163
因为（他们认为）那不是他们的（一部分） 然后当然他们会从床上摔下来 这对他们来说是相当大的震惊 所以...

2740
04:37:53,221 --> 04:37:56,472
因此 他们只会吃盘子上一半的食物

2741
04:37:56,472 --> 04:37:59,040
没有人真正能从现象学上理解这一点 对吧

2742
04:37:59,180 --> 04:38:01,708
因为我们无法想象那会是什么样子

2743
04:38:01,708 --> 04:38:08,328
我想这一定就像 你知道 你知道你身后有东西 但你并非看不到它们

2744
04:38:08,328 --> 04:38:09,292
它们就是不在那儿

2745
04:38:09,292 --> 04:38:11,620
它不像是黑色或任何东西 或者有一个空间

2746
04:38:11,921 --> 04:38:14,231
它只是不在那里

2747
04:38:14,231 --> 04:38:21,098
因此 我认为发生的情况是 "不存在 "的范围扩大到四分之三的场地 而不是一半的场地

2748
04:38:21,098 --> 04:38:21,600
这是一个猜测

2749
04:38:22,443 --> 04:38:29,680
不管怎样 拉梅什 现在 关于被忽视的人的有趣之处在于 如果你告诉他们 如果你指出这一点

2750
04:38:29,704 --> 04:38:36,904
你说 好吧 我注意到你今天没有动左脚 他们会说 好吧 这是关节炎 我不能动它

2751
04:38:37,001 --> 04:38:38,691
然后说 好吧 你为什么不尝试移动它呢

2752
04:38:38,691 --> 04:38:41,328
说 不 听着 医生 我已经告诉你了 它太疼了 无法移动

2753
04:38:41,328 --> 04:38:42,958
今天早上它还工作得好好的

2754
04:38:42,958 --> 04:38:47,258
那可能是事故几个月后的事了 所以这是一种否认

2755
04:38:47,282 --> 04:38:55,082
人们长时间以来实际上认为那是由创伤引起的否认 直到他们弄清楚那实际上是神经生理损伤的后果

2756
04:38:55,082 --> 04:39:06,382
现在 拉玛昌德兰发现 如果你灌溉对侧耳朵 比如现在如果你往某人的耳朵里倒冷水

2757
04:39:06,406 --> 04:39:13,006
它会干扰他们的前庭系统 他们的眼睛会像这样来回移动 你可以在派对上试试 如果你愿意

2758
04:39:13,100 --> 04:39:22,800
而且 呵 无论如何 拉玛昌德兰在测试这些患者的前庭功能时 他用冷水灌溉了右耳 他们醒了过来

2759
04:39:23,501 --> 04:39:32,340
也许发生的是 那足够震惊 所以想象一下右半球中的网络虽然受损但并未完全消失

2760
04:39:32,762 --> 04:39:36,659
他们需要一个非常高的激活阈值才能突然开始工作

2761
04:39:37,062 --> 04:39:38,137
这里有一个例子

2762
04:39:38,581 --> 04:39:41,118
如果你有帕金森病 想象你在那里僵硬

2763
04:39:41,621 --> 04:39:44,999
好吧 我朝你扔一个球 你会像这样 抓住它

2764
04:39:45,822 --> 04:39:47,157
但你不能扔回去

2765
04:39:48,241 --> 04:39:54,500
所以你可以 刺激就足够了 足以让你跨过门槛 但你不能自愿这么做

2766
04:39:54,701 --> 04:39:59,060
现在 如果你有帕金森氏症 比如 严重到一定程度 你甚至无法发现它

2767
04:39:59,181 --> 04:40:01,179
但在某个阶段你仍然可以这样做

2768
04:40:01,461 --> 04:40:11,160
有一个很好的案例研究 这位爷爷患有帕金森症 坐在轮椅上 他的小孙子在码头上玩耍 掉进水里 溺水

2769
04:40:11,481 --> 04:40:20,520
他从轮椅上站起来 走进大海 救了他 把他带到海滩上 坐回轮椅上 然后又瘫痪了

2770
04:40:20,961 --> 04:40:21,702
所以这就足够了

2771
04:40:21,702 --> 04:40:30,200
所以你可以想象 剩下足够的网络 所以如果情绪紧张变得足够高 退化的电路仍然可以发挥作用

2772
04:40:30,861 --> 04:40:33,046
那么 好吧 回到拉马钱德兰

2773
04:40:33,046 --> 04:40:39,980
当你灌溉空气时 右半球的连接突然闪现 其余的半球设法连接起来

2774
04:40:40,342 --> 04:40:44,620
这个人说 天哪 我中风了 我失去了身体的左侧

2775
04:40:44,680 --> 04:40:49,319
他们在哭泣 他们就像完全被灾难性地压垮了

2776
04:40:49,801 --> 04:40:57,719
20 分钟后 效果消失 他们又恢复了 现在他们又失去了左侧身体 但他们不记得了

2777
04:40:58,241 --> 04:41:05,979
因此 似乎发生的情况是右半球正在收集异常信息

2778
04:41:06,401 --> 04:41:07,429
这就是它的作用

2779
04:41:07,429 --> 04:41:08,859
这就是你做梦时的作用

2780
04:41:09,242 --> 04:41:10,879
这是 这是 这是 这是

2781
04:41:11,820 --> 04:41:19,631
以图像形式表示异常信息 然后慢慢地将其传递到左半球 这样它就不会淹没它

2782
04:41:19,631 --> 04:41:25,618
也许如果你醒来感到害怕 并且感到难以承受 那么你告诉别人你的梦 这可以帮助你弄清楚那是什么

2783
04:41:25,618 --> 04:41:33,675
但不管怎么说 右半球总是试图挖掘左半球的转化 对吗

2784
04:41:33,675 --> 04:41:34,420
所以现在想象一下

2785
04:41:35,503 --> 04:41:37,619
这种情况可能会偶尔发生 也可能会多次发生

2786
04:41:38,945 --> 04:41:45,380
所以也许你只是忽略了一点异常信息 你觉得你只是做了一些有点可怕的梦

2787
04:41:45,404 --> 04:41:52,904
或者也许你只是堆积了一大堆你正在忽略的事情 有些重要的怪物你还没有面对

2788
04:41:52,928 --> 04:42:04,228
也许有些情况下 右半球积累了足够多的反假设 可以说是关于世界如何运作的

2789
04:42:04,252 --> 04:42:13,152
从所有那些你忽略的事情中理出头绪 有一天它突然咔嚓一声 你就变成了一个新的人格

2790
04:42:13,176 --> 04:42:30,876
也许新的人格使你不再沉溺 就是像这样的东西 我认为是这样的 是的 好的

2791
04:42:30,900 --> 04:42:42,086
早上好 彼得森公民 哦天哪 我这里准备了一个真正的难题给你 哦好吧 你有额外的时间来处理这个问题真是太好了

2792
04:42:42,086 --> 04:42:47,124
我什至会说 我之前已经演练过了 希望不会没有效果

2793
04:42:47,124 --> 04:42:48,788
好吧好吧

2794
04:42:48,788 --> 04:42:56,019
现在 我理解 关于任何事物的心理意义的讲座 真的

2795
04:42:56,043 --> 04:43:09,643
无疑会漫游到以人为中心的世界观 但作为一个硬科学的从业者 我想要更深入一点挖掘

2796
04:43:09,700 --> 04:43:15,892
你知道 所以我寻求 我猜 创造自由和

2797
04:43:20,360 --> 04:43:23,092
和时间本质的宗教诠释

2798
04:43:25,202 --> 04:43:27,273
我显然找到了 这就是我在这里的原因

2799
04:43:28,620 --> 04:43:35,772
如果你认为你有一个以人为中心的世界观 那与约瑟夫·卡迪纳尔·拉辛格相比 根本算不了什么 你知道的

2800
04:43:37,420 --> 04:43:43,919
现在我喜欢认为 你知道这个麦克风 就是你一直在我这里静音的那个

2801
04:43:44,320 --> 04:43:49,998
你知道这个麦克风是一个存在于我们个体感知之外的对象

2802
04:43:50,680 --> 04:43:52,168
这只是我喜欢的看待方式

2803
04:43:54,660 --> 04:44:00,519
但然后我想到“美在观察者的眼中”这一概念 当然

2804
04:44:00,840 --> 04:44:10,068
我的意思是 当你谈论艺术 艺术的欣赏时 必须有某种主观元素融入其中

2805
04:44:10,068 --> 04:44:13,016
但也必须有一个限度

2806
04:44:13,016 --> 04:44:26,156
我的意思是 某些我们作为绝对杰作欣赏的艺术作品 比如米开朗基罗的《圣母怜子》 举例来说 你经常提起 因为它确实那么好

2807
04:44:26,156 --> 04:44:33,716
但有些东西 相比之下 它们就像是涂鸦 你知道的

2808
04:44:33,716 --> 04:44:35,140
现在 总有一种诱惑

2809
04:44:36,042 --> 04:44:44,889
好吧 去援引非重叠领域原则 但那看起来有点像是逃避问题 对吧

2810
04:44:44,889 --> 04:44:54,247
所以我为自己制定了 我猜 四个衡量标准 这帮助我区分艺术与平庸之间的差异

2811
04:44:54,247 --> 04:44:55,930
这里是这四个

2812
04:44:55,930 --> 04:44:58,736
第一 教育

2813
04:44:58,736 --> 04:45:01,083
第二 时间投入

2814
04:45:01,083 --> 04:45:02,189
你得投入时间

2815
04:45:02,189 --> 04:45:06,209
如果你是一名艺术家 这可能会成为你的全职工作

2816
04:45:06,209 --> 04:45:07,937
就是这样 你必须对此充满热情

2817
04:45:08,620 --> 04:45:11,811
第三 公共展示

2818
04:45:11,811 --> 04:45:16,167
艺术不是你自己拥有的东西 你把它藏在地下室 那就不是了

2819
04:45:16,167 --> 04:45:20,944
艺术是你必须表达的东西 是你必须分享的东西

2820
04:45:20,944 --> 04:45:29,210
第四点 我认为这是最重要的一点 视觉的有效性

2821
04:45:29,210 --> 04:45:33,947
如果你是一名艺术家 你必须有一个愿景 我们在这里经常谈论梦境状态

2822
04:45:33,947 --> 04:45:41,536
你进入梦境状态 你有灵感 但仅仅拥有灵感是不够的 因为那完全是主观的

2823
04:45:41,536 --> 04:45:53,979
艺术的部分在于拥有技巧、技能、意图 我猜还有能力 将那变成实际的东西 你知道的 然后你可以表达或分享

2824
04:45:53,979 --> 04:46:04,600
所以你能读一下卡迪纳尔·拉辛格对时间本质的解释 然后针对“美在观察者眼中”的概念

2825
04:46:04,941 --> 04:46:07,492
以及特别提到的身体积极性（正向）运动

2826
04:46:11,361 --> 04:46:17,283
我不认为我能 我认为 我认为那是

2827
04:47:06,188 --> 04:47:18,979
我认为 我认为你把太多东西纠缠在一起了 这也是一团乱麻 不是批评 我无法将它们全部足够快地

2828
04:47:19,280 --> 04:47:21,695
整合起来 以免让观众感到无聊至死

2829
04:47:22,440 --> 04:47:24,949
所以我要等等 我要等等

2830
04:47:29,038 --> 04:47:29,160
好的

2831
04:47:29,160 --> 04:47:34,040
彼得森先生 我对信仰的思想很着迷

2832
04:47:34,885 --> 04:47:35,673
信仰意味着什么

2833
04:47:36,420 --> 04:47:39,197
雅各听到一个声音并相信了它

2834
04:47:41,161 --> 04:47:43,056
他可能听到了其他声音

2835
04:47:43,721 --> 04:47:45,893
他为什么相信这个

2836
04:47:47,221 --> 04:47:55,480
为什么 什么 一定有一种先验的功能需要让他相信这个声音

2837
04:47:56,240 --> 04:47:58,416
这告诉了他一件事或另一件事

2838
04:47:59,201 --> 04:48:03,080
我认为这是贯穿《圣经》和《新约》的一条线索

2839
04:48:03,642 --> 04:48:09,040
我们期待的是 好吧 我承认我是一名基督徒 我表现得好像我相信上帝是真实的

2840
04:48:09,721 --> 04:48:18,000
因此 我们现在看到的每个英雄的故事中都有这种信仰的召唤

2841
04:48:18,381 --> 04:48:23,640
故事里总有那么一个时刻 英雄必须相信某事

2842
04:48:24,001 --> 04:48:27,799
超越他们面前的证据 也就是说 他们必须采取信仰的飞跃

2843
04:48:28,662 --> 04:48:33,660
我想知道 你是否能解读一下这种信仰体验

2844
04:48:34,381 --> 04:48:37,414
以及对人类如何选择相信一件事或另一个神

2845
04:48:37,414 --> 04:48:38,599
这是一个很好的问题

2846
04:48:38,599 --> 04:48:38,760
我是说

2847
04:48:40,185 --> 04:48:40,933
这还开着吗

2848
04:48:43,345 --> 04:48:44,133
这还有效吗

2849
04:48:45,361 --> 04:48:46,825
好吧 好吧 很好

2850
04:48:46,825 --> 04:48:52,360
嗯 我不知道 我不知道答案 这是一件非常奇怪的事情 因为

2851
04:48:53,102 --> 04:48:56,740
我们思考很多事情或者可以说 很多声音出现在我们的脑海中

2852
04:48:57,442 --> 04:49:07,500
因为当尼采对笛卡尔的“我思故我在”进行拆解时 他说 并不那么显然就有一个“我” 首先 它是一个统一体 像是

2853
04:49:08,584 --> 04:49:17,803
对自身透明的统一体 这当然被精神分析学家大力提取 并且他不确定是“我”以某种因果方式进行思考

2854
04:49:17,803 --> 04:49:26,440
他说 不 它更像是思想 某种思想在现象领域中出现 也许你在它们之间选择 或者它们占据了你

2855
04:49:26,464 --> 04:49:34,764
就像有很多其他方式来考虑它 我并不完全明白为什么我们选择走一条路径而不是另一条

2856
04:49:34,843 --> 04:49:40,400
当这么多路径自己呈现给我们时 你知道 人们倾向于谈论

2857
04:49:40,680 --> 04:49:52,039
那像是某种良知 对吧 现在也许就是那样...

2858
04:49:52,063 --> 04:50:04,963
我认为这必须与某事有关 我认为这是一个无尽的回归 因为你总是可以问为什么某个假设变成了主要的 但我暂时把那放在一边

2859
04:50:04,980 --> 04:50:16,860
在我看来 这与你的目标有关 你知道 你更有可能听从一个与你最根本目标一致的声音

2860
04:50:17,844 --> 04:50:25,319
然后问题是你最根本的目标来自哪里 根据我能够确定的 我将再次从心理学角度讲 那就是

2861
04:50:26,403 --> 04:50:31,320
首先 你是相当原始的亚人格的串联体

2862
04:50:31,621 --> 04:50:35,054
饿了 累了 心烦意乱 笑了

2863
04:50:35,054 --> 04:50:36,400
你可以在婴儿身上看到这一点

2864
04:50:36,460 --> 04:50:38,319
他们非常快速地在这些状态之间循环

2865
04:50:38,661 --> 04:50:44,460
最重要的是有一种婴儿般的统一 但它没有控制权 对吗

2866
04:50:45,201 --> 04:50:54,460
因此 发展中的个体必须弄清楚如何将这些原始的亚人格整合成一个统一的人格

2867
04:50:55,925 --> 04:51:00,760
同时他们将统一的人格融入社会统一体中

2868
04:51:01,823 --> 04:51:07,870
所以这部分是个人的融合 但它是由社会力量推动的

2869
04:51:07,870 --> 04:51:10,860
我的意思是即使当你看到婴儿被母乳喂养时

2870
04:51:12,202 --> 04:51:15,895
它与母亲建立了关系 并且存在互惠关系

2871
04:51:15,895 --> 04:51:17,260
这已经在那里发挥作用了

2872
04:51:18,204 --> 04:51:18,649
那么那么

2873
04:51:19,820 --> 04:51:26,240
潜在的多样性开始形成一个统一体 然后问题是 我会说这有点像

2874
04:51:27,561 --> 04:51:33,280
这有点像个体从泰坦中出现的过程

2875
04:51:33,882 --> 04:51:38,037
这是一种合理的思考方式 像是主权者从泰坦中出现

2876
04:51:38,037 --> 04:51:38,780
就是这样的东西

2877
04:51:39,921 --> 04:51:46,660
但然后还有另一个分裂 对我来说 这似乎与该隐和亚伯的分裂相平行

2878
04:51:46,684 --> 04:51:54,284
这种整合可以朝着积极的东西 但也可以朝着消极的东西

2879
04:51:54,323 --> 04:51:59,000
这就是世界分裂为善与恶 我认为 然后看起来

2880
04:51:59,280 --> 04:52:04,320
你在这两者间航行 我只能用某种选择来解释这一点 我认为是自由选择

2881
04:52:05,343 --> 04:52:06,859
即使我不理解它

2882
04:52:08,081 --> 04:52:20,040
我不愿因为我不理解自由选择就否认它的存在 因为在我看来 这就是人们的行为方式 这是他们期望被对待的方式 而那些...

2883
04:52:20,762 --> 04:52:25,840
根据人们拥有自由选择的观念来构建自己的社会实际上是有效的

2884
04:52:26,642 --> 04:52:30,660
现在这并不能证明存在自由选择 但人们一直在争论这一点 所以......

2885
04:52:31,802 --> 04:52:39,818
但在我看来 这是两种可能的整合方式 然后我认为你正在做的是不断地喂养其中之一

2886
04:52:41,348 --> 04:52:43,560
我想你可能会选择喂养哪一个

2887
04:52:44,102 --> 04:52:49,160
我想就是这样 我的意思是 这对我来说也是这样的感觉 就像当我看着自己的时候一样

2888
04:52:51,482 --> 04:52:54,275
也许你真的对某事感到恼火

2889
04:52:54,275 --> 04:52:55,440
也许你对你的妻子很恼火

2890
04:52:55,701 --> 04:52:59,280
或者你的孩子或者类似的事情并且

2891
04:53:00,464 --> 04:53:01,656
你感觉有点恶劣 而且

2892
04:53:02,861 --> 04:53:07,560
可能甚至知道你是错的 一个想法闪现在你脑海中 你想我可以说出来 而且

2893
04:53:08,704 --> 04:53:12,960
你知道你可以说出来 你知道它会产生什么效果 但然后你暂停了一下 你想

2894
04:53:15,186 --> 04:53:16,240
那会让事情变得更好还是更糟

2895
04:53:16,483 --> 04:53:17,919
然后或许你说 去它的

2896
04:53:18,441 --> 04:53:25,040
这是相当大胆的话 我马上就有个小故事要说 然后你说出来了 但你知道

2897
04:53:26,243 --> 04:53:28,540
你知道你选择了下下策 对吧

2898
04:53:29,503 --> 04:53:37,280
你知道的 然后你为此感到内疚并且开始辩护 这使得争执变得更糟 因为那时你绝不会承认你实际上做了那件事

2899
04:53:37,304 --> 04:53:43,004
所以事情真的变成了地狱 所以这里有一个丑陋的小想法

2900
04:53:43,081 --> 04:53:50,020
这和问题很相关 所以想象你在摆弄可卡因

2901
04:53:51,763 --> 04:53:54,420
我之所以用可卡因作为例子 是因为它非常容易上瘾

2902
04:53:54,701 --> 04:53:58,600
但它是一个非常有趣的化学物质 因为它是多巴胺激动剂 而且

2903
04:53:59,322 --> 04:54:03,940
多巴胺做的两件事是让你觉得你正在做的事情是值得的

2904
04:54:06,101 --> 04:54:14,680
想象一下 有一堆活跃的神经回路 然后它们受到多巴胺的刺激 或者你这样做 然后这些神经回路变得更强大

2905
04:54:15,743 --> 04:54:17,420
好的 所以它有回报属性

2906
04:54:18,320 --> 04:54:28,860
它让你觉得你正在做的事情很重要 并且它有一个强化属性 它使神经回路生长 那么现在这意味着什么

2907
04:54:28,860 --> 04:54:34,199
就是说 无论你在服用可卡因之前做了什么 都会增长

2908
04:54:35,804 --> 04:54:40,139
好吧 现在想象一下 在服用可卡因之前 您会做很多不同的事情

2909
04:54:41,022 --> 04:54:47,480
但存在一系列决策 并且在一个决策点 对于所有这些不同的事件都是相同的

2910
04:54:47,540 --> 04:54:50,259
这个决定点是 因为你遇到了麻烦

2911
04:54:50,722 --> 04:54:53,059
这个决定点就是 管它呢

2912
04:54:54,724 --> 04:55:01,100
好吧 那么你会想 你吸食可卡因 200 次 即使你在不同的地方吸食

2913
04:55:01,601 --> 04:55:09,080
但是那个思想一直存在 那个东西就会成长 因为你在强化它 它就会成长 它就会成长 它就会成长

2914
04:55:09,461 --> 04:55:14,260
所以现在它就在你体内 它是你的一部分 它就是让它见鬼去吧的东西

2915
04:55:15,283 --> 04:55:19,959
好吧 现在 也许这在你的大脑中生长并不是一件好事

2916
04:55:20,601 --> 04:55:28,700
那么 你就上瘾了 他们带你去可卡因治疗中心 一周后 你就不再上瘾了

2917
04:55:29,162 --> 04:55:32,918
只要你在那里 你就没有渴望 就没有问题

2918
04:55:33,481 --> 04:55:38,559
但随后他们带你回到正常的环境 你会看到 就像可卡因 乔 你的朋友

2919
04:55:39,201 --> 04:55:47,279
你一看到他 那个东西就来了 然后砰的一声 你又回到了地狱的轨道上

2920
04:55:47,821 --> 04:55:54,900
如果你足够长时间地强化这种特定的观点 那么你最终也会到达那里

2921
04:55:55,602 --> 04:55:59,759
所以 从某种意义上说 这类似于这个决策过程

2922
04:56:00,321 --> 04:56:04,919
如果你走低端路线 那么它就赢了 而且会变得更强大

2923
04:56:05,421 --> 04:56:10,695
因为从神经学角度来说 凡是获胜的事物都会变得更强大

2924
04:56:10,695 --> 04:56:12,159
这就像达尔文的竞争

2925
04:56:12,681 --> 04:56:16,459
因此 有一条规则是 不要实践你不想成为的人

2926
04:56:16,781 --> 04:56:18,808
因为你真的会变成那样

2927
04:56:18,808 --> 04:56:22,120
它直接构建到你的神经架构中

2928
04:56:22,702 --> 04:56:26,760
这是成瘾的可怕之处之一 因为你认为 这是一种心理上的

2929
04:56:28,771 --> 04:56:30,560
这也是一种神经生理学的

2930
04:56:30,640 --> 04:56:37,880
如果你用某种强化的东西打击自己足够多的话 你就会在你的头脑中建立一个独眼的可卡因怪物

2931
04:56:47,357 --> 04:56:48,599
最后一个问题 我猜

2932
04:56:49,541 --> 04:56:59,040
哈利路亚 就一个非常简单的问题 关于长期受苦 当它

2933
04:56:59,442 --> 04:57:07,818
从雅各和许多这些圣经故事中注意到的一件事是 你确实有这样一位全能的神 能够以某种方式

2934
04:57:08,822 --> 04:57:12,720
基本上成为叙述中的隐藏主角 但有趣的是

2935
04:57:13,906 --> 04:57:23,140
他在故事的过程中逐渐展示了一些他的品质 所以你谈到了关于神的奇怪悖论

2936
04:57:23,421 --> 04:57:27,972
不知怎的允许雅各（以色列）赢得斗争 所以我的问题是关于

2937
04:57:31,180 --> 04:57:38,345
你讲述的关于大鼠让小鼠赢的故事 你讲过三四次 我在你最近的视频中看到你谈论了它

2938
04:57:38,369 --> 04:57:43,469
大鼠让小鼠赢 因为那样小鼠才会继续参与游戏

2939
04:57:43,545 --> 04:57:46,295
所以我的问题有两个

2940
04:57:46,295 --> 04:57:54,748
一 神是否定期允许人类赢 以允许我们通过这些故事实际参与对话

2941
04:57:54,748 --> 04:57:57,600
二 这是否是

2942
04:57:57,901 --> 04:58:06,753
谦卑美德的一种更原始的版本 这不是人们通常会归于全能神的特质

2943
04:58:06,753 --> 04:58:09,199
嗯 这些都是很好的问题

2944
04:58:09,199 --> 04:58:21,278
我特别喜欢第二个问题 即神偶尔允许人类胜利的决定实际上是某种接近谦卑 或至少是怜悯的表现

2945
04:58:21,920 --> 04:58:23,938
但谦卑是对它的一个有趣的看法

2946
04:58:24,160 --> 04:58:36,039
嗯 这也与保罗关于基督如何交出自己 允许自己被人打败 从而征服罪恶（即人的敌人）的形象相关联

2947
04:58:36,541 --> 04:58:44,155
奇怪 这是同样的悖论 其中神与人们进入这种动态并自愿输掉

2948
04:58:44,179 --> 04:58:57,579
嗯 好吧 所以如果我要说的第一件事是 这是一个非常有趣的类比 问题足够复杂

2949
04:58:57,603 --> 04:59:06,503
以至于我认为我无法超越这个问题 因为它太复杂了 我认为我无法比你已经做得更好地表达它

2950
04:59:06,555 --> 04:59:08,565
就像是一串有趣的想法

2951
04:59:08,565 --> 04:59:10,814
我得花点时间来琢磨看看

2952
04:59:10,814 --> 04:59:21,539
这确实在为什么神在旧约中愿意进行谈判投下了有趣的光芒 这确实是一个奇怪的事情 正如你指出的那样

2953
04:59:21,539 --> 04:59:29,032
就像这是一位全能的神 显然可以做任何他想做的事 然而他却可以被议价

2954
04:59:29,032 --> 04:59:38,380
这也引出了为什么的问题 比如你的假设是 如果你不让小鼠偶尔赢一次 那么他们就会沮丧并退出游戏

2955
04:59:38,404 --> 04:59:46,004
这是一个很好的观察 如果人们不偶尔赢一次 你知道 那就是该隐发生的事情

2956
04:59:46,082 --> 04:59:48,231
神说 好吧 你没有公正地玩游戏

2957
04:59:48,231 --> 04:59:53,666
这就是你没有赢的原因 但我不知道

2958
04:59:57,869 --> 05:00:06,665
在旧约中有一个暗示 我认为在新约中这一点得到了更多发展 也许没有 那就是你玩得越公正 你赢的可能性就越大

2959
05:00:08,400 --> 05:00:17,474
所以 也许部分原因是神让亚伯拉罕讨价还价 甚至雅各也是 因为他们开始玩得非常公正

2960
05:00:18,520 --> 05:00:21,715
所以也许如果你玩得公正 你确实可以在与神的搏斗中赢

2961
05:00:22,960 --> 05:00:30,237
我的意思是 我认为那是真的 我实际上认为那是 我认为那是真的 因为那实际上是我们将其定义为公正游戏的原因

2962
05:00:30,801 --> 05:00:32,958
现在 我们可以再次从心理学角度来谈谈

2963
05:00:33,441 --> 05:00:37,319
我认为我们所认识到的公正游戏

2964
05:00:37,941 --> 05:00:46,739
是在最广泛的情况下 跨越最广泛的时间跨度 最有可能产生积极结果的游戏

2965
05:00:47,161 --> 05:00:51,518
这实际上是我们伦理观念的基础 那就是它真的很实用

2966
05:00:52,301 --> 05:00:57,619
不必过多赘述 因为切斯特顿的《星期四的人》中有一个有趣的见解

2967
05:00:58,041 --> 05:01:04,479
上帝将自己设置为仁慈的对手 以加速游戏的进行

2968
05:01:06,102 --> 05:01:08,800
是的 我认为这是一个非常有趣的思想

2969
05:01:08,880 --> 05:01:18,520
我的意思是 我想说 在整个圣经故事中都有暗示 上帝容忍撒旦的原因是

2970
05:01:18,781 --> 05:01:28,881
因为没有对手 你就会变得软弱 我的意思是 这与生活就像一场道德斗争的观念联系在一起

2971
05:01:28,905 --> 05:01:37,705
这是道德斗争的根本本质 我认为这在现象学上是一个合理的观察

2972
05:01:37,729 --> 05:01:45,129
也许其他人没有这样的经历 但在我看来 根据我自己的经历 这是准确的

2973
05:01:45,153 --> 05:01:49,353
现在我又不知道什么了 我不知道这说明了现实的基本本质

2974
05:01:49,377 --> 05:01:59,377
但有一次我有一个幻象 我和撒旦在一个竞技场里 真的 信不信由你 那是

2975
05:01:59,400 --> 05:02:14,146
像罗马竞技场一样 你知道 发现自己在那里我相当不安 但我赢了 之后我问上帝为什么要做这样的事 他的回答是

2976
05:02:15,465 --> 05:02:16,253
他知道我能赢

2977
05:02:17,322 --> 05:02:18,206
这很有趣

2978
05:02:18,206 --> 05:02:24,160
你知道 因为我真的不知道该怎么理解这个 相信我 我完全不知道 但想法是

2979
05:02:25,765 --> 05:02:27,520
如果你试图鼓励某人

2980
05:02:29,021 --> 05:02:39,000
而不是保护他们 因为这真的是不同的事情 对吧 保护某人并不是让他们变强 鼓励他们是让他们变强 那么你会给他们设置一系列挑战

2981
05:02:40,584 --> 05:02:40,868
对吧

2982
05:02:42,243 --> 05:02:44,599
在他们可能赢的时刻

2983
05:02:45,942 --> 05:02:51,504
也许你可以认为 如果你真的关心某人 你就会这么做 我知道这就是

2984
05:02:51,504 --> 05:02:54,653
我并不是说那种解释是正确的

2985
05:02:54,653 --> 05:02:57,019
我不是 我不是 但有些我

2986
05:02:58,141 --> 05:03:00,067
我的意思是 你肯定会对你的孩子这么做

2987
05:03:00,067 --> 05:03:04,140
你知道 当你和他们摔跤时 当你和他们玩耍时

2988
05:03:06,324 --> 05:03:08,340
你将他们推向他们能力的极限

2989
05:03:09,643 --> 05:03:12,440
否则他们不会超越当前的能力

2990
05:03:13,864 --> 05:03:14,046
所以

2991
05:03:17,421 --> 05:03:32,500
是的 所以我们会在12月见到你们一些人

2992
05:03:33,362 --> 05:03:42,300
也许大多数人 我认为那时我们会完成《创世纪》的学习 然后新的一年 可能要到春天

2993
05:03:43,262 --> 05:03:51,400
我会开始学习《出埃及记》 我真的很期待 因为我真的很喜欢《出埃及记》的故事 那是一个令人惊叹的故事 深不可测

2994
05:03:51,424 --> 05:04:00,424
到目前为止我们所覆盖的故事也很不错 但是 谢谢大家的到来 我们大约一个月后可能会再见
