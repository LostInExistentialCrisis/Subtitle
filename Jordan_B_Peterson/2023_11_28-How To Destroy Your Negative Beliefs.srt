1
00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:05,150
You say you are morally obligated to do remarkable things.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:05,250
Why?

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:21,650
Well, I think partly because life is so difficult and challenging that unless you give it everything you have, the chances are very high that it will embitter you,

4
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:26,683
and then you'll be a force for darkness and not good.

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:41,633
And so, you know, the fact that life is short and can be brutal can terrify you into hiding and avoiding but it can also

6
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:48,933
you can flip that on its head and understand that since you're all in anyways you might as well take

7
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,700
take the risks that are adventurous and that's a very good thing to understand

8
00:00:56,233 --> 00:01:04,550
and what is also useful to understand in that manner is that there isn't anything more adventurous than the truth.

9
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:07,200
This is something that took me a long time to figure out.

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,250
Well, you can craft your words to get what you want.

11
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:18,766
You know, when people do that all the time, they craft their words so they can avoid taking responsibility for things they should take responsibility for.

12
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:22,933
They can craft the words to gain an advantage that they really don't deserve.

13
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:31,866
That's what you do when manipulate, and the problem with that you might say well why not do that if I can get what I want and the answer to that is

14
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:42,900
you aren't necessarily the best judge of what you need and it's easy to be diluted in what you want and that's the sort of delusions that people chase if they chase power

15
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:54,633
if you decide instead that you're going to just say what you believe to be true you have to let go of the consequences and you might think well I don't want to let go of the consequences because because I wanna control what's going on.

16
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,583
But what you miss then is adventure because if you don't control what's going on,

17
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,350
you don't know what the hell's going to happen.

18
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:03,300
And maybe that's exciting

19
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,200
and actually there's no doubt about it.

20
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:13,733
And then you have the additional advantage if you're attempting to say what you believe to be true and attempting to act in the manner that you think is most appropriate.

21
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,950
That's genuinely you and you have the force of reality behind you.

22
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:24,700
And obviously that's what you have if you're trying to, say, live in the truth, is you have the force of reality behind you.

23
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:26,233
That seems like a good deal.

24
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,433
Then you have the reality and the adventure.

25
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,083
So why is that a moral obligation?

26
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:43,583
Well, if you hide and you don't let what's inside of you out, and you don't bring into the world what you could bring, and you become cynical and bitter, you will start doing very dark things.

27
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:56,083
So you'll start, not only will you not add to the world what you could add, but you'll start being jealous of people who are competent and doing well and work to destroy them.

28
00:02:57,033 --> 00:03:00,916
So that's the pathway to hell, really.

29
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:07,200
One of the trends that I've been railing against most recently has been cynicism.

30
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,516
There's this pervasive belief that everything is terrible

31
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:24,433
and it can't get better and the people who believe that it can improve are dumb and delusional the problem and I don't know where it comes from I don't I don't--

32
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:37,566
well it's the beginning of wisdom cynicism, this is part of the reason why it's hard to combat you know because people start out naive and naive people are optimistic but not really

33
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:48,966
they're just naive and naive people have no idea that there's say malevolence in the world they have no idea that there's as malevolence in their own heart, they're sheltered and dependent.

34
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:53,416
And when that breaks, it often breaks into cynicism.

35
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,216
And so cynicism is actually an improvement.

36
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,533
The veils have fallen from your eyes.

37
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Exactly, exactly.

38
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:06,783
The problem with cynicism is that, especially if it's allied with a kind of arrogance, is that you can end there, and that's a big mistake.

39
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:12,983
So then the question becomes, once you've been bitten hard and you're no longer naive,

40
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:16,316
Well, that is very hard on your optimism, let's say.

41
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:24,450
So then the question is, how do you restore that without reverting to the naivete, which you can't do anyways without blinding yourself once you've been bitten?

42
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:32,716
And the answer to that is you substitute courage for naivete and you regain your optimism as a moral imperative, right?

43
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,450
So one of the things you might ask yourself is,

44
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,650
well, if the future is likely to be catastrophic in a variety of different ways, which is definitely the case, both socially and personally,

45
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,516
then what attitude should you bring to bear on that?

46
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:51,066
And the answer might be, well, if you were courageous and faithful,

47
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:53,433
and I can explain what that means,

48
00:04:54,533 --> 00:05:02,166
then you would conduct yourself in a manner that met the future head on with the presumption that you can manage it.

49
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:05,150
And this is the presumption we should bring to bear politically.

50
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:16,900
The people who are using fear to garner power, point to the various apocalypses that might befall us.

51
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:22,300
And it's difficult to counter them because the future is always an apocalyptic horizon.

52
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:29,950
Like everything can fall apart and has before and might well again and will in fact in your life as you age and die.

53
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:33,283
And so it's very easy to conjure up an apocalypse.

54
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,983
Then the question becomes, the question becomes not is that apocalypse potentially real?

55
00:05:39,116 --> 00:05:42,666
Because the answer to that is yes, but what attitude should you have towards that?

56
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:44,966
Naive, that's not good.

57
00:05:45,316 --> 00:05:48,550
Cynical, that's better, but it's still not good.

58
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:49,683
It's another form of hell,

59
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:53,116
and it also tends to make the potential apocalypses more likely.

60
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,016
Well, so what do you have when you move beyond cynicism?

61
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:58,883
And what you have when you move beyond cynicism is wisdom.

62
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,833
And that's not naive, it's courageous.

63
00:06:02,516 --> 00:06:10,916
And one of the things that religious people have done relatively badly, especially in recent years, is they've failed to delineate the relationship between faith and courage.

64
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:18,900
You know, people like Dawkins and the New Atheists, they point to faith and they describe it as something like belief in foolish superstitions.

65
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:23,000
But that isn't really what faith in the deepest sense means.

66
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:32,533
It means that you are willing to act out the proposition that you can ride the wave no matter how big it becomes.

67
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,483
And that we can all do that together, especially if we do that in good will.

68
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:42,400
And I think that's a much more, it's a much more appropriate way to confront the future.

69
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:47,116
And it's also the proper medication for cynicism.

70
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:56,083
Now, the other thing about cynicism that's interesting too is that cynics aren't cynical enough about their own cynicism, right?

71
00:06:56,216 --> 00:07:02,233
Because you can get doubtful enough to start doubting the validity of your own cynicism.

72
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,283
It's like, what makes you so smart?

73
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,916
What makes you the judge of being?

74
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,966
And the Columbine kids were like that.

75
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:20,833
You know, they decided that existence itself was unsustainable given its cruelty and that the proper response was to put up a giant middle finger to man, men, and God, right?

76
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,250
Well, here's a way of being cynical about cynicism.

77
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:29,133
How does your cynicism let you off the hook, right?

78
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:37,100
How does your cynicism justify your desire to avoid necessary responsibility and to pursue your own short-term hedonic gains.

79
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,050
It's like, why aren't you cynical about your own doubt?

80
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,833
And that's another place where wisdom begins.

81
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:47,200
It's like, so that's two, right?

82
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:52,750
Cynicism beats naivety, but it's not the ultimate destination.

83
00:07:52,950 --> 00:08:03,650
And you should be cynical enough to question the moral validity of your own resentment and your own, what would you say, your own turning away from the world.

84
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,400
The way that I see it, given that we don't know the future,

85
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:10,183
given that much of our motivations are invisible to us,

86
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:15,366
we're not a crystal pond that we can see into,

87
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:19,716
you have to have some form of delusion about what's going to happen in the future.

88
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,616
You're trying your best to see the way that it's going to be but given that the glass could be half empty or half full,

89
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,966
why not have a delusion that's going to be useful to you?

90
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:33,750
One of hope, even in the face and the understanding that things might be difficult and that there's going to be obstacles.

91
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:43,966
You know, there was a line of social psychology that pursued that argument for quite a while that made the argument that people had to have positive illusions about the future

92
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,400
and that that was the fundamental way that people staved off despair and bolstered their self-esteem.

93
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:57,816
But I don't think we need to separate out the distinction between fantasy and delusion.

94
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:00,933
You do have a fantasy about the future.

95
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,766
You have to, because like you said, it's not structured.

96
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:06,950
So you have to provisionally map the future.

97
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,283
That's what a plan is.

98
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,016
Positive goal.

99
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:09,983
That's what a strategy is.

100
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,983
Right, but that doesn't make it a delusion.

101
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:18,100
It becomes a delusion when the map bears no relationship to the underlying territory.

102
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:23,666
So if you have a strategy for the future, maybe let's say that your strategy for the future,

103
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:28,666
just for the sake of argument, is that you have five million YouTube subscribers in three years.

104
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:40,583
Well, you have no evidence of the strict sort that that's how it's going to be because anything could happen between now and three years from now, let's say,

105
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,183
but there's no reason to call that a delusion.

106
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:57,033
It's one hypothetically possible path of potential and then you can make the sacrifices necessary to bring that about.

107
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,633
So even though it's a fantasy because it maps something that isn't there.

108
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:11,316
It's not a delusion, it's a delusion when you're ignoring elements of your own experience that would inform your fantasy more effectively.

109
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:18,750
You're ignoring them so that you can live in a positive representation of the future without having to pay the appropriate price for it.

110
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:24,516
One of my favorite ideas I learned over the last couple of years is the inner citadel from Isaiah Berlin, do you know this?

111
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,466
So, Asai Berlin says, when the natural road toward human fulfillment is blocked,

112
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:39,083
human beings retreat into themselves, become involved in themselves, and try to create inwardly that world which some evil fate has denied them externally.

113
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,483
That's a delusion often.

114
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:45,716
If you cannot obtain from the world that which you really desire, you must teach yourself not to want it.

115
00:10:46,116 --> 00:10:50,466
If you cannot get what you want, you must teach yourself to want what you can get.

116
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,166
This is a very frequent form of spiritual retreat in depth into a kind of inner citadel,

117
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:58,383
in which you lock yourself up against all of the fearful ills of the world.

118
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,766
Mutual friend Rob Henderson explained it in a simpler way.

119
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,033
If your leg is wounded, you can try to treat the leg.

120
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:10,333
And if you can't, then you cut the leg off and denounce that the desire for legs is misguided and must be subdued.

121
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,483
And I think that we see this everywhere.

122
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:20,966
Well, okay, so imagine that you lay out a plan and it meets with an impediment and it knocks the slats out from underneath the plan.

123
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:22,700
Okay, now you retreat.

124
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,266
Okay, now you have an option when you're retreating.

125
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:32,283
And one option is to construct a world in fantasy where you're taking revenge on those who wronged you and getting what you want.

126
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,166
That's a pathway to madness.

127
00:11:34,716 --> 00:11:41,183
So often people who develop serious delusions do develop, what would you call them?

128
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:43,233
They're compensatory fantasies.

129
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:46,666
And then they start to dwell in them, and often for hundreds of hours.

130
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:50,783
So the kids, again, who shot up the Columbine High School,

131
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:56,950
they dwelt in a fantasy world for hundreds of hours before they undertook their dreadful actions, right?

132
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:05,166
But you can also flip back into yourself, let's say, and you can, and this is like confession and atonement,

133
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:15,616
it's the proper way to think about it, is you can think about what it is that you did wrong or insufficiently that led to the collapse of your plan.

134
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,716
So that's the first investigation.

135
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:20,133
I made some sacrifices.

136
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:23,250
I attempted to bring about a particular form of the future.

137
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,166
It didn't happen.

138
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,133
Okay, why?

139
00:12:25,616 --> 00:12:30,466
Well, the world is set against me and the cosmos is evil and there's no God and I'm bitter and cynical.

140
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:33,166
That's one potential explanation, right?

141
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,583
Poor me, right?

142
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:41,016
And I'm not trying to be flippant about this because sometimes people's dreams are quite realistic and they still fail catastrophically.

143
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:42,400
You know, it can be brutal.

144
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:49,166
You know, maybe you did make a lot of good decisions and you suddenly got ill or someone in your family did and everything went to hell on you.

145
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,800
It doesn't have to be because you've done something cardinally foolish that you fail.

146
00:12:54,766 --> 00:12:56,300
It's built into the structure of the world.

147
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:57,700
But it doesn't matter.

148
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,750
You can also retreat into yourself and you can say something like,

149
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:08,183
all right, I need to retool my conception of strategy, but also potentially my conception of goal.

150
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,916
Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.

151
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:12,166
Maybe I have to look somewhere else.

152
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,850
And you can open yourself up to a revelation.

153
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,000
So there's a gospel statement that's very relevant to this.

154
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:21,283
So Christ tells his followers that if they knock, the door will open.

155
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:25,000
If they ask, they'll receive, and if they seek, they'll find.

156
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:37,400
And so it sounds magical, it sounds like the sort of thing that the new atheists would have a field day with, but that's not a wise interpretation of that saying.

157
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:43,583
The proper interpretation is something more like a recognition of the way thought works.

158
00:13:44,316 --> 00:13:46,100
So imagine your plans didn't work out.

159
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:48,350
Okay, now you sit down and you say to yourself,

160
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:58,433
I'd like to know, even if the world was conspiring against me and my failure was 95% the fault

161
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:11,983
of external occurrences and other people, what did I do that wasn't as good as it could have been and where did I fail to look so that the probability of my failure was higher?

162
00:14:13,316 --> 00:14:17,050
Now to ask that question, you have to want the answer.

163
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:25,800
what it means to knock or to ask or to seek this this is no joke it's like you have to want to know and it's a very painful thing to do

164
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:34,233
because especially if you had given it your all to the degree you were able and you have reason to be bitter

165
00:14:34,266 --> 00:14:41,866
you're going to be searching for the errors that you still made and discovering your own errors is always extremely painful right

166
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:51,266
especially if they're errors that you're in love with and so you have to be willing to strip yourself down that's what humility means fundamentally and then but

167
00:14:51,350 --> 00:15:00,483
the advantage is this is why it's so useful to listen to people you might find out where you're stupid and then you could stop being stupid

168
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:09,716
and so one of the reasons you confess your sins let's say is because you want to discover where you're insufficient now it's painful you know

169
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:18,716
it's painful to encounter an impediment in the form of someone else's opinion that might show you where you're blind and ignorant or willfully blind even

170
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,750
but the advantage to that is you can rectify the error and then as you move forward you're stronger.

171
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:30,133
You know one of the things I taught my kids and I hope at least somewhat successfully was that

172
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:37,566
you should always ask a stupid question and that doesn't mean the sort of question that someone who wasn't paying attention would ask.

173
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:46,150
If you're you're listening to someone and you don't understand what they're saying and you reveal that,

174
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:55,116
you're revealing your ignorance, you know, and maybe you're in a room full of people and you think you're the only person stupid enough to not get it, which is very rarely the case, by the way.

175
00:15:55,716 --> 00:16:01,966
The thing is though, if you reveal that ignorance to yourself and to the other person, they can rectify it.

176
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:05,083
And if you do that a thousand times, you're not ignorant anymore.

177
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,816
And this is a real pathway to success too.

178
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:12,200
You see it, you do this because you ask real questions in your podcast, and Rogan does this.

179
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:18,666
Okay, Rogan's always trying to be a little smarter than he already is, and then that works, iterated.

180
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:26,000
Like, if you ask a thousand dumb questions and you listen to the answer, then you know a thousand things some of them deep that you didn't know before.

181
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:35,550
So that's the advantage to searching your soul, let's say, for unrequited sins and attempting to atone.

182
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,150
That's not a delusion, right?

183
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,833
it's an attempt to set yourself right.

184
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:43,016
It's the opposite of a delusion, even though there can be a fantastical element to it.

185
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:55,166
Yeah, the conversation around people who try their best do as many things right as they could and yet still fall short because the world is random and unfortunate things happen.

186
00:16:56,233 --> 00:17:01,350
Happiness, as far as I can see it, sits in the gap between your expectations and reality.

187
00:17:02,516 --> 00:17:08,500
But the problem here is that people who have high standards often end up feeling a lack, right?

188
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:18,583
How can people who strive like this avoid feeling despondent at falling short of their own high standards?

189
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:23,333
I've heard you talk about the statue of David saying something like, you are not all that you could be.

190
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:24,283
Yeah.

191
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,933
And as soon as you posit an ideal, you begin to compare yourself to that ideal.

192
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:28,633
So-

193
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:30,616
Well, that's a good question.

194
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:40,800
I mean, the ultimate ideal is also the ultimate judge because the ultimate ideal is something against which you fall far short.

195
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,150
And that might be so painful that you can barely stand it.

196
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:53,833
But then what you do is you, two things I suppose, is you lower the ideal and you raise your estimation of your potential.

197
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,033
And what do I mean by lower the ideal?

198
00:17:57,766 --> 00:18:06,466
Well, if you're comparing yourself to someone or even to a future self and the gap is so painful that it paralyzes you,

199
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:11,550
then you've created a dragon that you don't have the tools to master.

200
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,366
And so what you have to do is you have to scale the dragon down to size.

201
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:25,383
And you wanna scale the dragon down to size until it's a size that you are willing to move toward, however small that is.

202
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:34,333
Now, you know, if you're here and your ideal is here and that gap is unbearable, then you reduce the gap and you reduce the gap.

203
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:39,783
And you're gonna have to do that anyways, because you're not gonna move from where you are to perfect in one fell swoop, right?

204
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,283
There's gonna be incremental steps.

205
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:52,916
So you have to fill in that hierarchy of progression with a high enough resolution representation so that you can start to move forward.

206
00:18:53,616 --> 00:18:55,366
And then you should be buttressed.

207
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,633
There's another gospel comment that's very interesting.

208
00:18:57,716 --> 00:18:59,816
It has to do, it's called the Matthew Principle.

209
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,900
And the Matthew Principle is,

210
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:06,583
To those who have everything more will be given and from those who have nothing everything will be taken

211
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:12,750
Now it's brutal because it implies that reality works like this when you're moving up you go like this

212
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:15,033
Right, and that's pretty nice.

213
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:19,666
That's a lot better than this But when you're going down you go like that, right?

214
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:24,966
It's like downhill downhill cliff Okay, so you want to avoid the downhill path?

215
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:39,116
Well, if the uphill path is like this, which is like exponential let's say or geometric then what that means is that it doesn't matter how big the first steps you take uphill are.

216
00:19:39,566 --> 00:19:53,400
Even if they're trivial, even if they're shameful in their size, because you're so useless, that, if you're disciplined in that, you'll speed up extraordinarily rapidly.

217
00:19:54,133 --> 00:20:01,450
And so that's the good news, you might say, is that you can take very small steps, even ones that might be shameful in their size

218
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:05,933
and you have to admit that to yourself, but once you get the ball rolling,

219
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:15,566
it doesn't roll in a linear fashion, it rolls in a geometric fashion and this is a really good thing to know because it can take the sting out of the realization of your own stupidity.

220
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:23,316
It's like, yeah, you know, everybody has their weak sides, let's say, things they're embarrassed about.

221
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:29,783
When I first started going to the gym, I was like, how old was I? 1985, 23.

222
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:36,016
And I think I weighed 135 pounds and I was six foot one, very, very thin.

223
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,133
A way I write, 27 inch waist, something like that.

224
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,350
And I smoked like mad and I drank too much.

225
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,533
Like I wasn't in good shape.

226
00:20:44,116 --> 00:20:50,466
The first attempts forward I took in the gym, I went to this swim exercise class.

227
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:55,166
Jesus, it was me and this like really fat guy, young guy.

228
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,933
Probably not in any worse shape than me and like seven old women over 70 and they could out swim me

229
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:10,316
Like it was pretty damn humiliating and so I did a semester of that got myself in somewhat better shape and then I started to go to the gym to

230
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:19,300
Work out to lift weights and that was also rough because you know I'd be underneath the bloody bench press trying to lift 75 pounds off the

231
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:25,800
the, off the rests and you know, some muscle headed bastard would come over and tell me how to do it.

232
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,850
And it's like, yeah, thank you.

233
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,583
But you know, it's embarrassing.

234
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:35,066
And lots of times people won't do things like go to the gym because they're so embarrassed about how they look or what sort of shape they're in.

235
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:41,166
And it's a pain to start at the bottom, but you start at the bottom where you're weak.

236
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:48,883
And if you want to rectify what's weak, you have to accept the fact that you're at the bottom and that the first steps are going to be painful.

237
00:21:48,950 --> 00:22:00,616
You know, it took me about three years, but I stopped smoking and then I stopped drinking and I gained 40 pounds of muscle in like three and a half years, something like that.

238
00:22:01,116 --> 00:22:05,266
I basically had to stop doing that because I had to eat like six times a day, it was crazy.

239
00:22:05,816 --> 00:22:15,283
But I got a lot more physically confident and a lot more coordinated because working out with dumbbells makes you coordinated, right?

240
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:21,366
Because it exercises all the small ligaments and the tendons, and so my lower body in particular got a lot more coordinated.

241
00:22:21,366 --> 00:22:25,616
Then I could dance, so that was better when I was going out dancing, because I did a lot of that in graduate school.

242
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:30,200
But the point of all this is, if you're gonna rectify your weaknesses,

243
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,250
you have to admit your insufficiency to your own shame.

244
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:40,666
Now, if the gap between you and your ideal is so great that it paralyzes you, you shrink that, right?

245
00:22:40,933 --> 00:22:45,050
We'll get back to talking to Jordan in one minute, but first I need to tell you about Maui Nui Venison.

246
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,766
Maui Nui Venison is the most protein dense and nutrient dense red meat on the planet.

247
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:51,700
Thank you.

248
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:56,666
Plus they're the only stress-free 100% wild harvested meat available.

249
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:03,000
My favorite method for cooking it is straight from frozen, salt the hell out of both sides,

250
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:09,483
12 minutes in an air fryer at maximum temperature, turn it over 12 minutes again and it is perfect every single time.

251
00:23:09,616 --> 00:23:11,066
It is such a life hack.

252
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,816
Actually taught to me by Jordan's daughter, Michaela, and all she does is eat meat.

253
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,166
so that's the way to do it.

254
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:22,150
All of the cuts are spectacular, but the venison sticks have been my new favorite while I've been traveling on the road.

255
00:23:22,316 --> 00:23:27,666

258
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,300
One of the things I've been talking about in the live shows is your comparison group is incorrect.

259
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:54,000
The fact that we have the opportunity to sit down and listen to anybody on the planet.

260
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:06,216
The best minds, the best athletes, the best thinkers, the most articulate that are alive right now all listen to the people that have died that were around when video cameras existed

261
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,250
and you can compare yourself to that group.

262
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,383
That's not your comparison group.

263
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:20,316
If you have the impetus to sit down and listen to me and you waffle on for three hours about these deep topics,

264
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:31,883
these interesting ideas, you are so already selected out of the normal group, you're already asking yourself questions that almost nobody else is, right?

265
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:37,083
But because your comparison group are people that are unbelievably high performing.

266
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:46,550
I remember before I started my podcast, listen to to you or to Sam or to Joe and I think God that recall is is amazing

267
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:56,166
so it's like they've just got this identity memory and everything that they've ever read is able to come to the surface and they're able to say it in this way that's completely seamless and all the rest of it

268
00:24:56,883 --> 00:25:03,583
are you really person that's never recorded a podcast before going to compare yourself to Joe Rogan man

269
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:12,200
that's recorded a thousand and spent ten thousand hours on stage and done all of this UFC commentary and done all of this stuff in terms of TV, is that really who you're going to compare yourself to?

270
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,033
And it's unfair.

271
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:25,033
And the problem that I see is people who have big dreams for themselves and want to do great things, they like to set their sights high and yet they feel despondent in the comparison.

272
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:27,333
So I think that that- Well, there's a pride in that too, eh?

273
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:28,850
I can be.

274
00:25:29,216 --> 00:25:29,650
I want to be.

275
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:33,650
Or that's who I should be comparing myself to, right?

276
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,566
That's the pride. is something like, I should be that, or even I could be that.

277
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:44,000
It's like, well, maybe you could, but you're certainly not going to do it, as you already pointed out, without the apprenticeship.

278
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:51,333
Right, so you could say that the despondency is actually, is in proportion to the false pride.

279
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:59,400
Now, I wrote a chapter in, I think, my first book, which was compare yourself to who you are today, not to who someone else is.

280
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:02,900
Sorry, I mangled that to some degree, but you get the point.

281
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:07,016
The proper comparison group for you is you yesterday,

282
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:15,350
because you can make, first of all, you're the only control group that's appropriate to you,

283
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:25,433
because you have a certain set of talents and possibilities and limitations and tragedies that are truly unique to you.

284
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:32,300
And so you might be comparing yourself to someone else on some dimension, but it's not a reasonable comparison

285
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:38,933
because you don't know what talents they were blessed with and you also don't know what opportunities they had that you didn't, et cetera.

286
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,616
It's just not a reasonable comparison.

287
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:45,700
It's a lot better to think about who you were and then to think, well, could you be some?

288
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,783
What better in some dimension?

289
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,583
And the positive thing about that is the answer is almost always yes.

290
00:26:52,966 --> 00:27:05,816
Now you can orient that transformation towards some stellar target and that's a reasonable thing to do, but that doesn't exactly mean that you should compare yourself to that target.

291
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,850
Aiming at something and comparing yourself to it are not exactly the same thing.

292
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,950
Plus your bloody comparison is also a delusion, you know?

293
00:27:14,016 --> 00:27:18,350
That's another thing that you have to understand is that you look at the person you're jealous of

294
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:26,283
and really what you're doing is you're looking through a very narrow aperture at a very thin slice of their life.

295
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:30,616
You're looking at the thin slice of their life that's turning out the best,

296
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:37,250
but you're also looking at a thin slice of their life that's marketed to be the best, right?

297
00:27:37,316 --> 00:27:42,833
And you have no idea what the horror of that person's life might be in its totality.

298
00:27:43,116 --> 00:27:46,150
And you have no idea if, like if the deal was,

299
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:52,100
say you wanted to be Russell Brand, there's a good example,

300
00:27:52,516 --> 00:27:56,433
you wanted to be Russell Brand, you wanted to be as charismatic and as famous as he is.

301
00:27:56,866 --> 00:28:03,466
Well, your real wish is that you get to have everything Russell Brandt has, but none of his problems.

302
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:05,316
Well, come on.

303
00:28:06,116 --> 00:28:18,000
I mean, that's just, it's just, it's no wonder that a vision like that would make you despondent because it's naive, it's resentful, it's jealous, it's bitter, and it's unreasonable.

304
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:20,500
You have to take the good with the bad.

305
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,033
You have to take the bad with the good.

306
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:28,600
And people rarely think about that when they're thinking about the famous people they think they'd like to be.

307
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:32,916
There was a recent interview with Elon Musk where he said something.

308
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,983
"'My mind is a storm.

309
00:28:35,733 --> 00:28:38,566
"'I don't think most people would want to be me.

310
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:44,783
"'They may think they would want to be me, "'but they don't, they don't know, they don't understand.'"

311
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:46,583
What do you think of that?

312
00:28:46,816 --> 00:28:50,166
Elon's someone that people probably look up to and admire and aspire to be.

313
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:57,750
One of the downsides to high-level genius is you might describe it as hypomania.

314
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:02,383
So here's a simple test that people can do.

315
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:09,083
So this is a test of something called verbal fluency and verbal fluency is associated with creativity.

316
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,350
And so here's a simple verbal fluency test.

317
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:17,466
Write down as many four letter words as you can in three minutes that begin with T.

318
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:21,433
Okay, that's pretty constrained, four letters and T.

319
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:26,666
Or write down as many words as you can in three minutes begin with S, that's less constrained.

320
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:27,550
All right.

321
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:36,166
So there's quite a powerful correlation between the sheer number of words that you produce and your lifetime creative achievement,

322
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:42,716
right, especially in the artistic and verbal domains, that's different than vocabulary.

323
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:45,083
Vocabulary is how many words you understand.

324
00:29:45,866 --> 00:29:48,783
Fluency is how many words you can produce in a given amount of time.

325
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,166
Deployment of those words, yeah.

326
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,916
Well, people vary to a degree that you can hardly imagine.

327
00:29:54,100 --> 00:30:01,383
So some people, if you get them to do the four letter test in three minutes, they'll write down like 12 words and some will write down 150.

328
00:30:03,016 --> 00:30:09,283
And the ones who are writing down 150, their minds are going at a hypomanic rate.

329
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,000
They're just thinking five times as fast as.

330
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,800
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.

331
00:30:14,566 --> 00:30:17,200
Yeah, without any remission whatsoever.

332
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:21,816
And when that gets completely out of control, you have manic.

333
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:23,150
You have someone who's manic.

334
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,233
And there's nothing fun about manic.

335
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:28,166
That's where the word maniac comes from.

336
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:35,150
And someone who's manic has a thousand different plans, each of which are one sentence long, that they're hyper enthusiastic about.

337
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:40,400
They'll spend every cent of their money pursuing them and things just go immediately to hell.

338
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:45,800
And so that's the outer limit of pathology on the creative front.

339
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:51,416
And someone like Musk, who's clearly a genius, that's what he's contending with in his internal landscape.

340
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:54,116
Now I'm not saying that he's manic I see no signs of that.

341
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:57,616
But someone that creative is on that edge.

342
00:30:57,633 --> 00:30:59,550
Or you see someone like Ben Shapiro.

343
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:04,133
I mean, it's very interesting to talk to Ben because, and Russell Brand is the same way.

344
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:09,783
Shapiro speaks, I think, more rapidly than anyone I ever met.

345
00:31:09,783 --> 00:31:14,300
But if you're with him, you see very clearly that he's probably thinking five times that fast.

346
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,500
And that's a lot.

347
00:31:15,516 --> 00:31:22,083
And when I was writing Maps of Meaning, which was my first book, I had a very difficult time shutting off my my mind, I was obsessed with that book.

348
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,216
And so I was writing about three hours a day.

349
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,683
And then I was thinking about the material, like for 12 hours.

350
00:31:31,533 --> 00:31:35,433
And the thoughts came as way faster than thinking.

351
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:38,016
They probably came about as fast as I can read.

352
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,850
I can read about 1200 words a minute if the material isn't overwhelmingly dense.

353
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:47,950
And so it was just nonstop thought for like 16 hours a day.

354
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,933
a day, that's part of the reason I started lifting weights.

355
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,383
Because if I was lifting heavy weights.

356
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,516
Can't be thinking 1,200 words a minute while I've got 100 pounds on my back.

357
00:31:56,716 --> 00:31:58,783
Exactly, it was enough to shut it down.

358
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:03,916
And it was also one of the reasons that I drank, because that was another thing that would shut it off.

359
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:13,483
Yeah, well I think the price that people pay to be the person that you admire is just such an interesting frame to look at someone like Elon Musk.

360
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:22,383
My mind is a storm, I don't think most people would want to be me, the price that you would have to pay in order to be me is not one that you would,

361
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:30,916
be one of the richest men on the planet and you get to dance on stage and release cars that are bulletproof and put rockets in space and stuff.

362
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,500
Well, yeah, but what about all of the baggage?

363
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:34,050
What's the price?

364
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:40,233
Well, he's also, he also appears to me to be hyper conscientious and I know people who've worked with him,

365
00:32:40,283 --> 00:32:50,183
like Musk isn't just a creative genius, he's also an extremely conscientious engineer, which, and really conscientious engineers, they have very interesting minds.

366
00:32:50,216 --> 00:32:53,383
I like talking to engineers because my brother-in-law is a great engineer.

367
00:32:53,450 --> 00:33:01,700
And when he understands something, Jim, when he understands something, he understands how to build it out of atoms, right?

368
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,016
Like he understands it at every single level.

369
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:14,083
And Musk appears to me to be someone who's this rare combination of hyper creative, but also hyper conscientious and I know that he works all the time.

370
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:21,283
Yeah, does that sort of hypertrophy executive function help to wrangle some of the diffuse creative energy?

371
00:33:21,616 --> 00:33:24,866
Oh, we're gonna put it into this one thing at least for a while, and then we'll move on to another.

372
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:27,316
Yes, yes, definitely, definitely.

373
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:30,550
Eric Weinstein's a good example of someone,

374
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:35,950
I hope Eric isn't annoyed by this, but Eric is unbelievably creative, but he's not particularly conscientious.

375
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:42,200
And so his, and I think he found an occupation where that works extremely well, because he's,

376
00:33:42,233 --> 00:33:48,633
I don't know if he's still doing this, but he worked with Peter Thiel for quite a long time as his idea man, right?

377
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:50,533
And Eric's an extremely interesting person.

378
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:58,083
Musk is hyper-creative and as far as I can tell hyper-conscientious and the conscientiousness does focus.

379
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:04,500
And that lots of people who are creative aren't conscientious, well it's rare.

380
00:34:04,616 --> 00:34:08,750
Like if you're one in a, there's no correlation between creativity and conscientiousness.

381
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,916
Okay, so if you're one in a thousand,

382
00:34:12,516 --> 00:34:18,666
If you're the most creative person in a thousand and you're the most conscientious person in a thousand, you're one person in a million.

383
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,933
And Musk is probably more like one person in a hundred million, right?

384
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:24,866
Something like that.

385
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:28,016
Maybe more, but, or maybe a billion, right?

386
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:28,566
Maybe.

387
00:34:30,716 --> 00:34:40,066
Yeah, it's interesting to consider the changes that happen to people as well as their platforms, as the scrutiny around them continues to increase.

388
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:46,450
Obviously, this has been a journey for you over the last nearly approaching 10 years now, of was it 2006, was that still C16?

389
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,383
2016, yeah, sorry.

390
00:34:52,433 --> 00:34:56,116
How have you found fame change you?

391
00:34:56,566 --> 00:35:03,333
What's been impacted or changed due to the scrutiny and the surveillance and the adoration and the criticism?

392
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:13,950
Well, the first thing that changed, I think, was that I saw a misery on a scale that I hadn't really seen it before.

393
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:26,333
I had worked as a clinician for a long time and I worked with say 20 people a week and I was always in the realm of difficult existential problems,

394
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:31,283
wrestling with my clients' problems alongside of them and I liked that a lot.

395
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:37,633
And then I had my research and I had my family and various business interests

396
00:35:37,683 --> 00:35:49,083
so that misery in some ways was contained and boxed in and I had a lot of structure around that to be able to function despite the fact that,

397
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:54,233
you know, I was neck deep in 20 people's serious problems, which I really liked, by the way.

398
00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:06,733
When I started speaking on a larger scale and meeting more and more people, this scale of demoralization really hit me.

399
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,566
I didn't know that, I didn't know how deep the demoralization in our culture had become.

400
00:36:13,366 --> 00:36:17,500
And I think that was especially obvious to me at that point among young men.

401
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:25,466
Now, it looks like, this is Jonathan Haidt's research is indicating this, that possibly young women are even in worse shape.

402
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,350
But for whatever reason, most of the people I was meeting at least to begin with were young men.

403
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:34,933
I think it was probably because most of them, far more people on YouTube are young men.

404
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:45,516
And so it was shocking and brutal to see how much demoralization,

405
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:50,866
how widely spread the demoralization in our culture was.

406
00:36:52,366 --> 00:36:56,283
Other than that, and that was a real shock, and it was very hard on me, I would say.

407
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:04,283
Everything else about it has been, at minimum, ridiculously interesting.

408
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,316
I have an unbelievable wealth of opportunity.

409
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,283
I'd be a fool to be anything but abjectly grateful.

410
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:16,500
I mean, the misery that I saw was a shock and it hurt me and it was part of what made me ill.

411
00:37:16,566 --> 00:37:17,383
How did that impact you?

412
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:19,316
Did it change the way that you see the world at all?

413
00:37:27,283 --> 00:37:34,300
It made me understand more deeply how important it was to offer people an encouraging word.

414
00:37:35,666 --> 00:37:43,850
I could see that so many people were dying psychologically or actually for lack of an encouraging word.

415
00:37:44,716 --> 00:37:54,383
And so it made being in the position to provide that much more necessary.

416
00:37:54,916 --> 00:38:02,050
And part of the reason that Tammy and I tour constantly is because it seems to be good.

417
00:38:02,566 --> 00:38:03,683
It seems to be a good thing.

418
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,716
You know, we've even seen changes in the audience.

419
00:38:07,766 --> 00:38:12,616
So five years ago, six years ago, when we did our first tour,

420
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:16,400
a lot of the people who came to the talks were in pretty rough shape.

421
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,133
There were more men than there are now, like the proportion of men to women was higher,

422
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:26,383
and the men were generally there alone, and a lot of them were looking pretty ragged around the edges.

423
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:31,466
And now, five years later, half the audience comes in suits.

424
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:34,350
It's as if they're dressed for a wedding.

425
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:37,433
Most of the guys are there with some woman.

426
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:46,433
The audience members are doing much better and the lecture events are extremely positive.

427
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:56,650
If you looked at my life from the outside, you'd think that I was in a constant storm of aggravated controversy, but all of that, virtually all of that is virtual.

428
00:38:57,566 --> 00:38:58,950
It's just in the online world.

429
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:08,266
Now, it touches the actual world from time to time because I am being pursued by my regulatory college in Ontario.

430
00:39:08,266 --> 00:39:08,783
A re-education camp.

431
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:17,916
Yeah, yeah, yeah, which is mostly just an annoyance and a preposterous annoyance, a preposterous, expensive, and time-consuming annoyance.

432
00:39:18,366 --> 00:39:31,916
But apart from that, everything that's happened around me has been positive, that's a strange thing too, positive at such an intensity that even that is daunting.

433
00:39:32,983 --> 00:39:45,850
You know, you'd think it's hard to imagine that you could be in a situation where things are so positive that you can barely stand it, but I am in that situation and it's quite something to contend with.

434
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:53,983
I was fortunate, I suppose, to some degree that it didn't happen to me till I was old because I've never really got accustomed to it.

435
00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:01,350
I've had a thought about this, observing what's happened to you and the Weinsteins are a good example of this too.

436
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,433
We often hear the perils of getting fame too young,

437
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,983
in the Macaulay Culkin's of the world, the Britney Spears of the world,

438
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:18,133
individuals who don't have any sense of identity being thrust into a non-representative experience of the world and they're completely unmoored.

439
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,550
but I think that there's an equally interesting question to ask, okay, and what happens if you think you know who you are?

440
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:34,816
If you've spent decades, five decades, six decades of your life understanding your place, your status, the trajectory that you're on, and then out of nowhere,

441
00:40:35,483 --> 00:40:40,333
you get ripped away from all of the areas of reference,

442
00:40:40,616 --> 00:40:44,400
all of the way markers that you thought you knew, and now you're just floating in the air.

443
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:48,166
I imagine that could be even more disquieting in some ways.

444
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:59,750
Well, when everything blew up around me to begin with, it was stressful, I would say, because my job was on the line, my university job, and I never thought that would happen.

445
00:40:59,816 --> 00:41:07,500
I mean, when I worked at Harvard and at the University of Toronto, that was all positive.

446
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,916
Like, I really liked working with my graduate students.

447
00:41:10,016 --> 00:41:16,916
I had at least cordial relationships with my fellow faculty members at Harvard.

448
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:17,950
They were more than cordial.

449
00:41:18,283 --> 00:41:26,766
At the University of Toronto, most of the faculty members that I started to develop friendships with were also those who ended up moving away.

450
00:41:27,483 --> 00:41:32,850
And they were often people who got offers from other places and they would disappear.

451
00:41:32,966 --> 00:41:37,250
And so a lot of the friends I developed at the University of Toronto went elsewhere.

452
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:45,633
And so I didn't get as tightly tied in with regards to friendship networks among my peers as I had at Harvard, for example.

453
00:41:45,716 --> 00:41:50,483
but I had great relationships with undergraduates and with my graduate students, and that was plenty.

454
00:41:50,566 --> 00:41:56,350
Like, I loved working with my graduate students, and so it wasn't like I was pining and alone, not at all, and I had a good network of friends.

455
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:05,433
And so then that was threatened and really disappeared in 2016,

456
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,433
and my clinical practice was threatened, and so that was unsettling.

457
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,783
I think there were things that continued though.

458
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:21,833
Even when I was teaching as a university professor, the way I taught wasn't typical.

459
00:42:23,066 --> 00:42:24,783
The things I taught weren't typical.

460
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:31,350
I thought for decades, you know, eventually someone's gonna find out what I'm teaching and, you know, there's gonna be trouble.

461
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:37,316
I couldn't believe I was allowed, encouraged to teach what I was teaching.

462
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:46,883
But you know, the universities, and this was particularly true of Harvard in the 90s, that's how they were structured.

463
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,783
What was so rebellious about what you were teaching?

464
00:42:53,066 --> 00:43:01,150
Well, there wasn't really anybody who was concentrating on the nexus between say, archetypal ideas, archetypal and religious ideas and neuroscience.

465
00:43:01,483 --> 00:43:03,450
So that wasn't a thing.

466
00:43:04,316 --> 00:43:07,366
I mean, there was a few people, Jaak Panksepp was one of them who,

467
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:14,516
a lot of the researchers who were interested in the neuroscience of emotion became interested in deep narrative

468
00:43:15,016 --> 00:43:19,950
because they started to understand that our emotional life is a story.

469
00:43:20,183 --> 00:43:21,533
That's a good way of thinking about it.

470
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:26,250
And that we're guided by our emotional instincts.

471
00:43:26,383 --> 00:43:30,266
And what our emotional instincts do is put us into certain stories.

472
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:33,916
That's what it means to be in love, for example, is that you're in a love story.

473
00:43:35,066 --> 00:43:39,933
It's not a particular balance of oxytocin and endorphins that you are aware of.

474
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:41,883
It's not broken down to its constituent parts.

475
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:42,833
No, definitely not.

476
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:45,633
It's part of a narrative that you tell yourself about what this means and how this feels.

477
00:43:45,766 --> 00:43:46,350
Right, right.

478
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:50,350
Well, and it's interesting that the instinct manifests itself as a story.

479
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:53,783
And so I was very interested in narrative and story.

480
00:43:54,533 --> 00:44:02,400
And also, see, no psychologist study Carl Jung, like literally virtually none.

481
00:44:02,716 --> 00:44:02,900
Really?

482
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:05,066
Yeah, yeah, no, definitely not.

483
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:14,766
I mean, psychology, psychology really developed in some ways as the materialist antithesis to psychoanalysis.

484
00:44:15,516 --> 00:44:19,066
So Freud and Jung, and even Adler to some degree,

485
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:25,600
they were off limits for scientifically trained behavioral psychologists.

486
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,550
And that's what I was and am, like I trained at McGill.

487
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:32,533
There were no courses in psychoanalytic theory at McGill.

488
00:44:32,983 --> 00:44:35,333
I read Freud and Jung completely on my own,

489
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:46,650
flying in the face of the advice that I was getting even from my well-meaning graduate supervisor who was a great guy and who never got in my way in the least, quite the contrary,

490
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:55,083
but I was warned, for example, when I went on the job market not to talk about the things that I was truly interested in.

491
00:44:55,166 --> 00:45:02,200
And I ignored that, by the way, and what that meant was some places that I went to apply for a job didn't want me,

492
00:45:02,683 --> 00:45:14,816
But then Harvard did, so that worked out quite nicely, you know, and that's one of the advantages too, also of being true to your own vision is that you won't get what you don't want.

493
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:19,033
See, I didn't want to go work somewhere where they wouldn't want me.

494
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:22,116
I wanted to go work somewhere where they wanted me.

495
00:45:22,566 --> 00:45:25,050
So my strategy was, well, this is who I am.

496
00:45:25,616 --> 00:45:35,800
And if you don't want me, you know, that's a drag cause I'm looking for a job, but by the same token i'm not going to pretend to be someone other than who i am so i can work here

497
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:46,850
what a stupid way of starting your career well that goes back to the truth right telling the truth what are you going to if you tell a sufficiently seductive lie what is the best that you can hope for right

498
00:45:46,866 --> 00:45:50,466
the person that you're telling the lie to falls in love with a projection

499
00:45:50,483 --> 00:46:01,383
right right absolutely well when i applied to graduate school i wrote a crazy admissions letter and i basically laid out who I was, flaws and all, and what I was interested in,

500
00:46:01,416 --> 00:46:15,716
and two people, three people bit, and the one that I liked best, partly because he was at McGill and I wanted to be in Montreal, was my graduate supervisor, Robert Peel,

501
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:19,033
and he knew what he was getting, and we had a great time.

502
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:26,400
I still work with him, like I had one of the best relationships with Bob that I've ever had with anyone in my life, and it's lasted four decades

503
00:46:26,433 --> 00:46:37,233
and it was because like Bob's a very honest person we were very different he's very practical he's a very good administrator a managerial type although he's super smart

504
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:50,850
he had an exhaustive knowledge of the relevant research psychology literature and I came in you know flying on a mat of psychoanalytic theory and philosophy and religious ideas very very different

505
00:46:50,866 --> 00:47:00,366
although we shared a real deep interest in the practicalities of research and he taught me how to fall in love with the more scientific end of the research distribution

506
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:08,883
but the point I'm making is that he knew he knew what he was getting right from the beginning and so did I

507
00:47:08,983 --> 00:47:18,300
and that worked like a charm there was no reason for any sort of subterfuge and it turned out that that are his talents and mine dovetailed extremely well.

508
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:24,716
So, and we had a blast, I loved working with, well, that's why we've been working together for 40 years.

509
00:47:25,283 --> 00:47:31,333
I traveled all over North America with Bob because we also started a business and it was great.

510
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,166
It was great.

511
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:39,100
The thing is, you know, if you tell people who you are and an opportunity opens up, it opens up for you.

512
00:47:39,483 --> 00:47:39,683
Yes.

513
00:47:40,283 --> 00:47:42,216
Not for this thing you've created, this lie.

514
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:48,050
There's this story that Douglas Murray told me about one of his first bosses at an early newspaper that he worked at.

515
00:47:48,216 --> 00:47:49,233
I can't remember the gentleman's name.

516
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:53,616
This guy is a legend within the industry.

517
00:47:53,683 --> 00:47:54,700
He's been working for a long time.

518
00:47:54,766 --> 00:48:01,383
He's accumulated a number of haters and fans and toward the back end of his career,

519
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:12,950
as Douglas is starting his, he decides that he wants to release a West End play about the life of Prince Charles and rhyming couplets. adventurous as West End plays go.

520
00:48:13,216 --> 00:48:18,600
And obviously there was all of this scrutiny because he was this very well known individual within the publishing world.

521
00:48:19,383 --> 00:48:26,566
And opening night, by the halftime interval, there was no one left in the entire auditorium, including the cast.

522
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:30,033
And this guy was devastated, right?

523
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,366
And he was mocked in the press and all the rest of it.

524
00:48:33,116 --> 00:48:36,750
Apparently Douglas saw him shortly afterward and asked him kindly.

525
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:39,516
He was like, look, like, what were you thinking?

526
00:48:40,466 --> 00:48:44,583
West End play about the life of Prince Charles and fucking rhyming couplets.

527
00:48:45,683 --> 00:48:50,766
He said, well, Douglas, I followed my instincts and instincts, they may sometimes lead you wrong,

528
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:53,633
but they're the only thing that's ever led you right.

529
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:54,433
Right, right.

530
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,616
And that stuck with me because.

531
00:48:56,916 --> 00:49:02,550
Yeah, well, there's something very relevant there too on the instinctual front.

532
00:49:03,166 --> 00:49:10,133
Okay, so things will beckon to you and call to you and you'll have intuitions about which pathway to take.

533
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:15,400
And you will in all likelihood follow those because what else do you have?

534
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:16,950
You have these orienting instincts.

535
00:49:18,066 --> 00:49:19,833
This is another reason why you don't lie.

536
00:49:21,366 --> 00:49:23,466
Because if you lie and you practice lying,

537
00:49:24,183 --> 00:49:28,300
you pathologize your instincts and then your intuitions lead you wrong.

538
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,416
And so there's a sin that's laid out in the gospels.

539
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,450
It's the sin against the Holy Ghost and it's unforgivable.

540
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:39,483
And people have been debating for like 2000 years about what this particular sin is,

541
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:46,716
but it's something like the pathologization of the instincts that orient you.

542
00:49:47,366 --> 00:49:52,166
If you sacrifice your relationship to the truth, you warp your vision and then you can't see.

543
00:49:52,900 --> 00:50:01,600
And then one day it'll be dark and there'll be sharp things in the fog in front of you and you'll wander right into them because you've pathologized your own vision.

544
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:10,866
You don't want to lie because you program yourself falsely and then you automatically see what isn't there.

545
00:50:11,416 --> 00:50:17,866
And then, of course, the world will slap you in the face continually and you'll think, oh my God, the world's such a pathological place,

546
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:24,050
when the truth of the matter is is that, no, you just keep running into things that you refuse to see.

547
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,566
And then you think, well, the world's made of nothing but obstacles.

548
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:37,183
It's like, well, you put the obstacles in your own path and you did that by developing these complex self-serving delusions,

549
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:40,666
a story that you tell other people about who you are that isn't true.

550
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:48,216
You're trying to lay out a map that bears no relationship to reality and you keep wondering why you wander off the path and into a pit.

551
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:51,100
It's like, well, how could it be otherwise?

552
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:59,883
It's, you see, if you really understand this, people have commented to me many times about my bravery and I don't like that.

553
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,300
It's not right.

554
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,833
I'm afraid of different things than the typical person.

555
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:09,466
Maybe that's a good way of thinking about it.

556
00:51:09,883 --> 00:51:15,066
I'm way more afraid of the consequences of saying something that's false

557
00:51:15,866 --> 00:51:25,133
or wandering off the appropriate path than I am of whatever consequences might come for saying what I believe and doing what I believe to be the case.

558
00:51:25,966 --> 00:51:27,250
I'm way more afraid of that.

559
00:51:27,783 --> 00:51:31,433
You know, I've been reading the Gospel of St.

560
00:51:31,433 --> 00:51:31,800
Matthew.

561
00:51:32,716 --> 00:51:35,266
I'm writing a book at the moment called We Who Wrestle With God.

562
00:51:35,316 --> 00:51:48,116
And one of the things Christ says to people continually is to not damage their vision, is to not put, that's the best way of putting it.

563
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,800
Don't occlude your eye.

564
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,483
You can see what's in front of you if you're willing to see it.

565
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,450
And if you're willing to see it, the terrible, many of the terrible obstacles in life, you can just walk around.

566
00:52:01,283 --> 00:52:08,350
But if you blind yourself purposefully to follow your own narrow self-serving delusion,

567
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:15,133
you're gonna run into terrible things and terrible people and the terrible part of your own soul all the time.

568
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,966
That's what you should be afraid of.

569
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:24,450
But the best thing that you can hope for, if you do do that, is to fluke success living somebody else's life.

570
00:52:24,483 --> 00:52:26,600
Right, right, great, wonderful.

571
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:27,783
Yeah, exactly.

572
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:31,516
You get to be a successful fraud.

573
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:35,000
I remember this documentary about Ron Jeremy.

574
00:52:35,283 --> 00:52:36,550
I think they called him the Hedgehog.

575
00:52:36,616 --> 00:52:38,133
He was this famous porn star.

576
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,866
I've seen a music video with him in, yeah.

577
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:40,466
Yeah, okay.

578
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:43,316
Not one of the world's most attractive people physically.

579
00:52:43,783 --> 00:52:46,633
And he lived in this very interesting world.

580
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:53,416
He lived in this world, he was stopped constantly on the street by people who thought Ron Jeremy was a hero, right?

581
00:52:53,516 --> 00:52:59,833
So he was in hell because the people who admired him were the people who admired.

582
00:53:01,516 --> 00:53:06,666
He was surrounded by the people who thought that he was an avatar of success, right?

583
00:53:06,866 --> 00:53:09,016
And so he got what he wanted, I suppose.

584
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,516
He had easy access to easy women.

591
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:51,283
Going into the holiday season, you might want to get the man in your life a gift or hint at him that he's a tiny bit more hairy than you would like.

592
00:53:51,566 --> 00:53:56,183
And the Manscaped Lawnmower 5.0 Ultra is the perfect blending of these two worlds.

593
00:53:56,516 --> 00:54:02,733
Since we're on YouTube, I can't show you how this actually works, but what I can show you is that transformation right there.

598
00:54:18,983 --> 00:54:19,550
Let me give you this.

599
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:28,166
This is why I think the beginning of the incel movement and the black pill movement was born out of pickup artistry.

600
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:40,916
The origin, if you trace it back using internet history, of the incel black pill ideology was a, I think it's a subreddit or a website called PUAHate, pickup artist hate.

601
00:54:41,716 --> 00:54:52,683
And what it was was a group of men who had been through the pipeline of pickup artistry come out the other side with a very jaded and even more jaded view of the world.

602
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:53,650
Even more jaded?

603
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:54,766
Yes, and I'll tell you why.

604
00:54:55,016 --> 00:55:02,350
So what happens if a guy learns old school, mid 20 noughts pickup artistry,

605
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:08,666
is you realize that there is a particular set of actions, a script that you can run,

606
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,850
which makes it more likely that a woman is going to go to bed with you.

607
00:55:13,883 --> 00:55:24,250
But what you realize when you do that, as you learn how to neg and do Kino escalation and tell them that story about the midget fight outside or whatever your script is that you're running,

608
00:55:25,016 --> 00:55:32,283
you then begin to see just how far away that person is from the person that you actually show up as.

609
00:55:32,616 --> 00:55:32,766
Right.

610
00:55:33,366 --> 00:55:41,833
Who you are and this extravagant persona that you need to convolute into existence in order to get this woman into bed makes you feel-

611
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:42,783
Worse even.

612
00:55:44,366 --> 00:55:48,350
Feel the gap between where you are and what you have to do in order to achieve the thing that you want.

613
00:55:48,383 --> 00:55:54,183
Now what you don't realize is that there are a million other ways that you could become sufficiently charming to get this person to like you.

614
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,866
This is just- By actually doing it, for example.

615
00:55:57,350 --> 00:56:04,650
This is just one that happens to be robust and easy enough to write down in a book and easy enough for most guys to replicate.

616
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:07,033
Yeah, well it's basically a form of scripted psychopathy.

617
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:11,650
So what a psychopath does is feign competence, right?

618
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,700
So most psychopaths are very emotionally stable.

619
00:56:15,383 --> 00:56:24,216
And so one of the early stage markers for competence is self-possession and calmness.

620
00:56:25,016 --> 00:56:29,850
And so if you're not an anxious person, you've got an edge on that already.

621
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,783
And most psychopaths are very high in emotional stability.

622
00:56:33,683 --> 00:56:38,133
And so they look confident, because confident people tend not to be that nervous.

623
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,016
Like if you're doing something you're expert at, Well, you're not nervous because you know how to do it.

624
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,166
Okay, so the lack of nervousness is a hint to competence.

625
00:56:46,466 --> 00:56:47,650
Well, you can feign that.

626
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,250
You can feign competence.

627
00:56:49,766 --> 00:56:51,500
You can feign confidence.

628
00:56:51,716 --> 00:56:53,366
That's what the pickup artists teach.

629
00:56:53,483 --> 00:56:57,316
Now, I would say there's even some utility in what they do, right?

630
00:56:57,416 --> 00:57:10,700
Because if you're dependent and bitter and resentful and charmless and self-destructive and nervous and nervous and socially unskilled,

631
00:57:11,116 --> 00:57:14,816
the probability that you're going to be successful with women is very, very low.

632
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:17,916
Okay, so you should be other than who you are.

633
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:24,683
Now, if you start putting on this persona, then you could think about that as a new suit of clothes,

634
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:28,483
and you could learn through that how to fill in the gaps.

635
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:29,566
Fake it until you make it.

636
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:30,983
Absolutely, absolutely.

637
00:57:31,466 --> 00:57:37,650
But if you take on that without doing the effort necessary to integrate that in a genuine way,

638
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:43,500
then all that's happening is that you're being rewarded for being fake, right?

639
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:50,033
And that's part of the problem with that too, is that you're practicing learning how to manipulate people in a psychopathic way.

640
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:53,650
And if you practice that, of course you're going to become jaded.

641
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:56,233
Like there's nothing more jaded than a psychopath.

642
00:57:56,766 --> 00:58:00,683
I mean, that's the ultimate extreme of jadedness.

643
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:06,433
And if you practice manipulating, especially if the women happen to be reasonably good women.

644
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:13,966
If you practice manipulating them and you're successful, then you're learning to be one, you're learning to be one horrible person.

645
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:22,666
Now, you know, as you're completely useless, unproductive, and undesirable former self, you weren't exactly stellar to begin with,

646
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:28,500
but substituting psychopathy for that was sort of like substituting cynicism for naivety.

647
00:58:28,966 --> 00:58:46,816
Now, as a complex problem, I mean, part of the reason that people like Andrew Tate are so attractive to young guys is because they do put up that confident, that false confidence.

648
00:58:47,866 --> 00:58:54,700
Tate's a complicated guy cause it's not all false, you know, real people are complicated the way that like villains in comic books aren't.

649
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:56,766
Tate's a fighter.

650
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:00,533
It's clearly the case that he's got a certain degree of physical bravery.

651
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:01,733
That's real.

652
00:59:02,716 --> 00:59:02,983
All right.

653
00:59:04,566 --> 00:59:14,450
There's an element of what he says that's very attractive to bedroom basement dwelling losers because he's at least there out in the world,

654
00:59:14,966 --> 00:59:20,150
you know, taking the blows and he's got a fast car and he's flashy and he's attracted to women.

655
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:26,650
But a lot of what he's done, especially with women, doesn't just border into the psychopathic, it crosses the line.

656
00:59:27,283 --> 00:59:29,700
And that's not a good model.

657
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:37,116
It's not an optimal model for people who are trying to progress, but it's a strange thing because just as cynicism is an improvement over naivety,

658
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:44,033
the capacity to be dark is an improvement over the lack of ability to be dark at all.

659
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:52,133
And so Tate is attractive in the way that the shadow beckons to people who are undeveloped, right?

660
00:59:52,183 --> 01:00:00,966
Because it does, it's like you're neurotic and you're dependent and you're repressed because you're immature and harmless.

661
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:03,766
Well, one way out of that is to stop being harmless.

662
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:07,716
And one of the things you can say about Tate is that he's not harmless, right?

663
01:00:07,783 --> 01:00:09,066
Well, it's a virtue.

664
01:00:11,016 --> 01:00:13,600
Now, it's a virtue that has to be bracketed.

665
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:19,666
It's like cynicism is a virtue compared to naivety, but it's not virtuous in and of itself.

666
01:00:19,966 --> 01:00:21,233
It's a step on the way.

667
01:00:22,183 --> 01:00:28,816
And so maybe you can learn how to feign confidence and you can learn how that works and maybe that's an improvement.

668
01:00:29,216 --> 01:00:34,733
I had a guy in my clinical practice who got involved with the pickup artist community and he taught me a lot about it.

669
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:41,400
And one of the exercises that their initiates had to do was to go out and ask 50 women for their phone number in one day.

670
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,316
And that's a great exercise.

671
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,366
You know, and I'm not suggesting-

672
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,683
Exposure therapy, approach anxiety.

673
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:47,333
Absolutely, absolutely.

674
01:00:47,883 --> 01:00:51,466
Absolutely getting over your fear of rejection, right?

675
01:00:51,516 --> 01:00:55,316
And 50 times they'll do that because you're gonna get rejected the vast majority of times.

676
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:55,533
50 times.

677
01:00:55,916 --> 01:00:57,083
Well, likely 50 times.

678
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:59,816
although generally that wasn't people's experience.

679
01:01:00,383 --> 01:01:05,516
If they were even vaguely skilled, they'd at least get a false phone number out of the deal.

680
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:14,966
But then they could, they learned that the rejection wasn't as catastrophic as they thought, but more importantly, they learned that they could continue moving forward in the face of rejection.

681
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:21,950
So the thing that it makes me think about there is intellectual humility and how tightly people hold onto their beliefs,

682
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:28,783
that if you believe that you are always going to be right, that there is nothing to learn outside of you,

683
01:01:29,316 --> 01:01:35,050
and that any kind of admission that you might be wrong is tantamount to destruction, it does exactly the same thing.

684
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,650
You need to, and it goes back to asking stupid questions,

685
01:01:38,983 --> 01:01:48,900
being prepared to ask the stupid questions and look not like the most informed person in the room, but also, importantly, nowhere near the most stupid person in the room, because you're the one that's asking the questions.

686
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:56,433
Well, the stupidest person in the room is the person who doesn't know and won't ask, or even worse, who doesn't know and won't ask and acts like they know.

687
01:01:56,683 --> 01:01:57,133
Ah, yeah.

688
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,400
That's not good at all, yeah.

689
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:03,133
There's a, from your- See, that's part of that idea that you should love your enemy.

690
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:05,666
So you might say, well, why should you do that?

691
01:02:05,783 --> 01:02:08,633
Well, your enemy is going to be your harshest critic.

692
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:16,500
Now it's possible that if you have a very good enemy, that he will show you flaws in your character that you didn't know were there.

693
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:25,833
And so that's a, it's a very, it's a very strange way of looking at the world, to think that you should welcome an attack.

694
01:02:25,983 --> 01:02:32,516
you should, but this is right, I'm saying that with all due caution, let's say.

695
01:02:33,866 --> 01:02:44,133
The more vicious the attack, the more of your potential hidden flaws might be revealed.

696
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,133
Have you found that to be true?

697
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:46,066
Oh, definitely.

698
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:58,150
But I've also found that attacks force you to contend with it, to see if it's there, right, to test it.

699
01:02:58,616 --> 01:03:04,583
I suppose the attacks that have come after me that have been most successful, they're almost always journalists,

700
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,450
and they're usually British female journalists, but not always.

701
01:03:08,483 --> 01:03:12,616
We produce a nation of hard-hitting journalists.

702
01:03:12,966 --> 01:03:22,383
Yeah, well, and faith in journalists is the lowest in the UK and anywhere in the Western world, and I can see why, you know, but there's some advantage.

703
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:25,650
There's some real advantage to facing someone.

704
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,033
It's a Pharisee problem.

705
01:03:28,716 --> 01:03:33,833
In the gospels, Christ was always contending with these Pharisees.

706
01:03:34,116 --> 01:03:38,133
And what the Pharisees were always trying to do was to lay a verbal trap for him.

707
01:03:38,266 --> 01:03:38,666
So he was-

708
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:39,816
Is a Pharisee a person?

709
01:03:39,866 --> 01:03:42,083
Pharisee was a Jewish sect.

710
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:42,933
Okay.

711
01:03:43,483 --> 01:03:47,083
And the Pharisees were very legalistic in their interpretation of Mosaic law.

712
01:03:47,116 --> 01:03:53,600
And so they were sort of, they were hypocritical, the way they're portrayed in the gospels, and they're hypocritical, by the book, moralists.

713
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:58,083
And part of what, and most of their morality was for show.

714
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,516
They like to pray in public.

715
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:01,333
They like to be seen being holy.

716
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:04,200
At least that's the criticisms that are levied against them.

717
01:04:04,283 --> 01:04:12,700
And what they're always trying to do in the gospel accounts is to lay a verbal trap for Christ so that they can expose him as a heretic and kill him, right?

718
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:16,483
So every single thing they say is a snare of some sort.

719
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,716
And there's lots of journalists like that.

720
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:22,283
Nellie Bowles, who wrote an article about me for the New York Times,

721
01:04:22,916 --> 01:04:30,300
which was a very devastating article in many ways and very serpentine and subtle.

722
01:04:31,616 --> 01:04:44,183
She, three years later, she wrote another article about what it was like to work for the New York Times when she was working there and the tricks that the journalists played, including her.

723
01:04:44,383 --> 01:04:54,216
And she said that the game was to devastate someone else's reputation in the attempt to boost yours, right?

724
01:04:54,283 --> 01:04:57,566
So you could think about it as a game of comparative moral standing.

725
01:04:58,066 --> 01:05:04,733
So the journalist's trick is to trick you into saying something that will end your career, essentially.

726
01:05:04,983 --> 01:05:07,016
Their social status stands on the shoulders of yours.

727
01:05:07,466 --> 01:05:08,683
Absolutely, absolutely.

728
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:15,150
And so now the advantage to being in a situation like that is that you have to step,

729
01:05:15,766 --> 01:05:20,700
if you step extremely carefully and you're fortunate,

730
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:26,433
then you evade the traps and then the interview tilts hard in your favour.

731
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:39,766
And so the most, the interviews that have done me the most good in the long run were the two interviews that were most hostile, one by channels for Kathy.

732
01:05:40,283 --> 01:05:41,000
Kathy Newman.

733
01:05:41,016 --> 01:05:41,500
Kathy Newman.

734
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:42,133
Kathy Griffin.

735
01:05:42,483 --> 01:05:44,933
And Kathy, Kathy at least had a sense of humor.

736
01:05:45,383 --> 01:05:50,833
Another one by Helen Lewis, who had no sense of humor at all and doesn't seem to have learned anything at all in the interim.

737
01:05:51,366 --> 01:05:56,950
But I think that one has 80 million views now, twice as many as the Kathy Newman interview.

738
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,316
Like it just keeps racking up views.

739
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:06,100
And it was because Helen Lewis, she has like 50 tricks or a hundred tricks.

740
01:06:06,183 --> 01:06:08,983
Kathy had like four, you know, and they were pretty blunt.

741
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,233
And she had a sense of humor about them.

742
01:06:11,716 --> 01:06:15,350
But Helen Lewis, she was just all tricks, and lots of them, and smart.

743
01:06:15,883 --> 01:06:22,233
You know, and it's quite something to talk to someone who's quite smart and quite educated, but all tricks.

744
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,550
And so, but, you know.

745
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:26,116
How does it feel, looking back on those two?

746
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:27,233
They were a very formative time.

747
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:30,866
It was kind of the inflection point, or one of the inflection points, I suppose, for yourself as well.

748
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:31,266
Yeah.

749
01:06:31,883 --> 01:06:33,183
How does it feel, looking back on that?

750
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:39,550
I remember you said at the time, it took you many days to recover from that kind of cantankerous, sort of adversarial interview.

751
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:44,316
Does that seem like a different lifetime or is that still very much sort of with you?

752
01:06:44,466 --> 01:06:46,350
Well, I'm a lot healthier than I was then.

753
01:06:46,866 --> 01:06:53,016
So those sorts of things wouldn't have the same effect on me now as they did then because I was ill.

754
01:06:53,116 --> 01:06:56,433
It took me a long time to recover from a serious bout.

755
01:06:56,483 --> 01:06:58,416
I mean, the first time I talked to Sam Harris,

756
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:03,216
not that Sam played tricks like, I like Sam and we've had very productive conversations.

757
01:07:04,266 --> 01:07:08,400
I was so ill when the first time I talked to Sam that I could barely sit in my chair.

758
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:11,266
Talking to Sam Harris makes you ill, that's the.

759
01:07:11,566 --> 01:07:15,883
No, no, not at all, no, no, Sam and I have had very productive conversations.

760
01:07:15,916 --> 01:07:19,983
That was another good example, I suppose, of the utility of an adversarial conversation.

761
01:07:21,116 --> 01:07:23,833
I mean, Sam comes to a conversation like that

762
01:07:24,316 --> 01:07:32,066
pretty well armed, but it's very helpful because it forces you to look in nooks and crannies

763
01:07:32,766 --> 01:07:39,250
that you might not have looked in and to be crystal clear to the degree that that's possible about what you're actually saying.

764
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:43,116
The idea of loving your enemy is something I've been playing with a little bit recently.

765
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:53,616
There's been, I guess, my platform's getting to the level now where there's a reason for someone to have a bullseye pointed at least remotely in my direction.

766
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,666
Because there's no point in trying to take somebody down that's got nothing, that's got no status.

767
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,066
Why would you invest the time?

768
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,333
The step that you're going to get in terms of your status standing on their shoulders is so small that no one can notice.

769
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:06,066
Right, so it's a backhanded compliment.

770
01:08:06,216 --> 01:08:07,116
Yeah, in some ways.

771
01:08:08,016 --> 01:08:08,800
But you're right, man.

772
01:08:08,916 --> 01:08:11,066
Some of the criticisms that I've gotten,

773
01:08:11,366 --> 01:08:14,416
I was reminded by a friend recently about this,

774
01:08:15,766 --> 01:08:21,583
have been some of the best inflection points, very uncomfortable, and to see it as a gift,

775
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:26,700
to think about that thing as a gift, it's like, I know that you weren't doing this to make me better.

776
01:08:27,366 --> 01:08:34,683
I know that you weren't doing this to try and benefit me, and yet, in reflection, it's like alchemy.

777
01:08:34,766 --> 01:08:37,633
It's like how Rory Sutherland calls it alchemy, taking something that was bad.

778
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:39,083
I had this reflection as well.

779
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:47,366
Yeah, well, we've learned, my family's learned, like when a public attack occurs, there's a massive opportunity nested in it.

780
01:08:47,966 --> 01:08:57,016
If you can reorient, it's like, okay, this is bad, this is vicious, this is not, this does not look good, and maybe it could take me out, take us out.

781
01:08:58,116 --> 01:09:06,483
Is there a way, is there a way we can play with this that will not only neutralize it, but twisted in the other direction.

782
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:14,616
I think that thing we did that was most effective on that side of things was when I was written into Captain America as-

783
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:15,916
I spoke to you that day.

784
01:09:15,966 --> 01:09:16,633
As Red Skull.

785
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:18,033
I spoke to you that day that it happened.

786
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,233
Yeah, oh yeah.

787
01:09:19,316 --> 01:09:19,833
The magical-

788
01:09:20,483 --> 01:09:21,350
Magical super Nazi.

789
01:09:21,566 --> 01:09:22,400
Floating Nazi or whatever.

790
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,283
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

791
01:09:23,383 --> 01:09:24,633
Well, it was shocking, right?

792
01:09:24,666 --> 01:09:26,183
It was very shocking.

793
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:27,283
And then Olivia Wilde.

794
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:29,233
Yeah, that was shocking too.

795
01:09:29,516 --> 01:09:29,900
Yeah, yeah.

796
01:09:30,316 --> 01:09:31,150
There's a litany of shocking things.

797
01:09:31,183 --> 01:09:31,766
Yes, yes.

798
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:38,066
and it became increasingly preposterous and the Olivia Wilde episode was one of the,

799
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,833
that was so preposterous that it was almost immediately laughable.

800
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:50,900
I think mercifully that film was so badly made and I'm pretty sure that she'd cast her boyfriend as one of the, got rid of someone that was super competent and put somebody in that was pretty incompetent

801
01:09:51,416 --> 01:09:53,400
and I think that that kind of caused it to flub.

802
01:09:53,616 --> 01:10:00,750
But yeah, man, the enemy thing, I've ended up becoming really good friends with one of my harshest critics, it's so strange.

803
01:10:01,383 --> 01:10:03,833
and yet makes complete sense afterward.

804
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,600
You had a- How did you end up making friends?

805
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:17,416
So I got criticized by a pair of podcasters who do this, they kind of take down

806
01:10:17,716 --> 01:10:21,483
or they have a very critical eye of much of the podcasting world.

807
01:10:21,766 --> 01:10:26,850
And they did an episode about an episode that I'd done and they have a right of reply thing.

808
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:27,233
Oh yeah.

809
01:10:27,766 --> 01:10:29,050
Sam's been on to do it.

810
01:10:29,816 --> 01:10:31,350
Who else has been on to do it?

811
01:10:31,616 --> 01:10:34,116
I did it, a couple of other, Constantine Kissen's been on to do it.

812
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:38,816
And I went on and there was a bit of like, I listened to their show.

813
01:10:39,066 --> 01:10:45,250
I think it's a very illuminating way to see how people that have a different perspective about what's going on in your world, see it.

814
01:10:45,566 --> 01:10:49,633
And I was like, yeah, I got the opportunity to go on and have a conversation and I did.

815
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:54,833
And I found them to both be like way more charming than I thought that they were going to be.

816
01:10:55,383 --> 01:10:58,850
And I've ended up both Chris and Matt, although Matt less so.

817
01:10:59,183 --> 01:11:04,700
But with Chris, we must speak once a month, every couple of weeks, one of us will just ring

818
01:11:05,066 --> 01:11:08,950
and we'll catch up about what's been going on in the world and he has a very different sort of worldview to me.

819
01:11:09,183 --> 01:11:10,500
He lives in a different area of the world.

820
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:20,116
He's a psychologist studying religion, I think, and sacred rituals and stuff like that, rituals rather than religion.

821
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:25,166
And now he points out blind spots that I don't see

822
01:11:25,616 --> 01:11:34,966
And that one particular instance was, and it was really uncomfortable because this was still, this was three years ago or something now maybe.

823
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:37,916
And I'm still super uncomfortable about it.

824
01:11:37,966 --> 01:11:44,416
And oh my God, these people are gonna take me down and they're both academics and they're really, really well educated and they're gonna be smart and they're gonna say things that make me look silly.

825
01:11:44,516 --> 01:11:47,916
And I said things that made me look silly and picked a particular episode where blah, blah, blah.

826
01:11:49,283 --> 01:11:53,866
And yet in reflection, it's been that one instance

827
01:11:54,366 --> 01:12:05,866
And the subsequent rumination about it was one of the biggest inflection points for me going from having blind spots that I hadn't seen to that.

828
01:12:05,866 --> 01:12:16,033
And I almost think that the degree of discomfort that I went through was mandatory because had I not felt so much like fear and anxiety and embarrassment about the fact

829
01:12:16,066 --> 01:12:22,966
that it's going to be out there and there's going to be all this focus and attention in not a nice way and there'll be tweets and all the rest of this stuff,

830
01:12:22,983 --> 01:12:29,416
That was sufficiently uncomfortable to force me to actually genuinely look at the things that I was doing that I was getting wrong.

831
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:31,500
And I'm sure that there's a million things I'm still getting wrong.

832
01:12:32,066 --> 01:12:35,316
But yeah, it was as much a gift as it could be.

833
01:12:35,616 --> 01:12:38,983
We'll get back to talking to Jordan in one minute, but first I need to tell you about Element.

834
01:12:39,166 --> 01:12:41,933
I've used Element every single morning for over three years now.

835
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,916
It is the way I start every single day.

836
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,883
It tastes fantastic, it optimizes my hydration, it helps to regulate my appetite and it improves my brain health.

837
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:55,100
element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio of sodium, potassium, and magnesium.

838
01:12:55,283 --> 01:12:58,733
Best of all, they've got a brand new chocolate caramel flavour, which you can have hot.

839
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:02,516
Hot element, I hear you say, what sort of hydration blasphemy is this?

840
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:06,616
But no, it tastes fantastic, and on cold mornings, it's perfect.

841
01:13:06,783 --> 01:13:16,250
There is a no BS, no questions asked refund policy, so you can buy it and try it completely risk-free, and if you do not like it for any reason, they will give you your money back and you don't even need to return the box.

842
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:23,566
I've used this every single morning for as long as I can remember and that orange flavour is phenomenal, plus that chocolate caramel is available

843
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:38,200
right now if you go to the link in the show notes below or head to www.drinklmnt.com slash modern wisdom for a free sample pack of all 8 flavours with your first box, that's www.drinklmnt.com slash modern wisdom.

844
01:13:38,216 --> 01:13:47,550
Here's another thing, I spoke to David Goggins about this last year, about how I was bullied as a kid and I was quite unpopular in school and I was an only child so I didn't really have

845
01:13:48,816 --> 01:13:58,683
many people to back me up you know in the school yard or whatever and I for a long time had a chip on my shoulder about the kids that mistreated me in school

846
01:13:58,733 --> 01:14:07,333
as you might expect and then I got toward you know maybe a few years ago and I really really started to reflect on it and realized that

847
01:14:07,383 --> 01:14:15,383
so many of the things that I valued in myself were the light side of something dark that had had been created during that time in school.

848
01:14:16,183 --> 01:14:24,450
So my complete preparedness to just spend time on my own means that I don't mind about moving out to a country

849
01:14:25,116 --> 01:14:27,683
where I don't know anybody and trying to make this podcast thing work

850
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:35,100
or spending hours and hours working or researching or recording podcasts or doing intros or whatever it is, like all of those things.

851
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:41,500
Not having a super tight social network as a kid meant that I wasn't beholden to anybody.

852
01:14:42,166 --> 01:14:50,483
when I grew up that I didn't feel the need to have as much support as I go along to do stuff.

853
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:54,566
Now, other sides of it haven't been so great because I still seek validation.

854
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:59,166
I still seek a lot of validation because that was something that I was missing as a kid.

855
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:06,800
But yeah, realizing not only you probably wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the things that you went through.

856
01:15:07,466 --> 01:15:08,333
Okay, there's step one.

857
01:15:09,116 --> 01:15:13,866
And then step two is, and I'm quite grateful for what I've done.

858
01:15:14,466 --> 01:15:16,183
And then step three would be something like,

859
01:15:16,566 --> 01:15:20,883
wow, I'm proud of myself for having turned something that was negative into something that's positive.

860
01:15:21,766 --> 01:15:28,000
But then another level above that would be, wow, so maybe I should be thankful.

861
01:15:28,116 --> 01:15:28,750
Yeah, right.

862
01:15:29,166 --> 01:15:36,816
Well, we were talking earlier in the podcast about what is the appropriate attitude towards the future.

863
01:15:37,566 --> 01:15:41,950
And I would say, well, we could put past, present, and future in the same bin.

864
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:47,116
Say, well, one of the things that you wanna do is practice gratitude.

865
01:15:47,183 --> 01:15:51,766
That's one of the primary religious rituals, you might say, is the practice of gratitude.

866
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:56,583
And you might say, well, my life is so horrible, what do I have to be grateful for?

867
01:15:57,216 --> 01:16:05,083
And I would say that's, for better or worse, that's still a form of blindness, right?

868
01:16:05,216 --> 01:16:10,100
I mean, people can have very, very difficult situations, can be in very, very difficult situations.

869
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:18,633
And it's in those difficult situations where the search for gratitude becomes something that is by necessity deeper and more difficult.

870
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,766
But that doesn't mean it's not appropriate.

871
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:31,983
No one, there is a very tight association between loving your enemy and being grateful in spite of the terrible things that occur in your life.

872
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:39,033
I've been writing about the book of Job, and Job is a story of unjust suffering, fundamentally.

873
01:16:40,183 --> 01:16:46,933
God deems Job a good man, so we have it on God's word that Job is actually a good man, and then all hell breaks loose,

874
01:16:46,966 --> 01:16:52,866
partly because God makes a bet with Satan, which is, you know, a hell of a thing to do, and says, do your worst.

875
01:16:52,866 --> 01:16:55,333
He's not going to turn on me no matter what you do.

876
01:16:56,116 --> 01:17:03,016
And so Job, despite his torment, he becomes very ill, becomes very ill, he loses everything he has.

877
01:17:03,616 --> 01:17:06,666
His friends, he becomes ill in a way that's disfiguring.

878
01:17:06,783 --> 01:17:13,116
His friends come around and laugh at him and tell him that he's a bad man and that's why all these terrible things have been happening to him and it's brutal.

879
01:17:13,816 --> 01:17:18,283
And Job refuses to lose faith in himself.

880
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:20,716
He says, look, I'm not perfect.

881
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:25,683
But as far as men go, I've done what I should do

882
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:33,366
And I'm not being punished in some manner that's obviously related to my sin.

883
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:39,416
It's more like the random play of tragic forces in the world.

884
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,066
I'm not going to lose faith in myself no matter what.

885
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:49,550
And I'm also not going to, his wife says, shake your fist at God, curse him and die.

886
01:17:49,983 --> 01:17:53,566
Because things have gone so badly for Job, she thinks that's all that's left to him.

887
01:17:53,616 --> 01:17:54,800
And he refuses to do that.

888
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:59,916
So he maintains faith regardless of what's happened to him.

889
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:07,533
And that's really the moral of the story of Job, which is that you are morally obligated to maintain faith no matter what happens to you.

890
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:09,983
And there's a practical side to that.

891
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:15,450
So imagine that God and Satan conspire against you.

892
01:18:15,516 --> 01:18:18,050
There'll be times in your life where it feels like that's happening.

893
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:24,366
And then imagine that your reaction to that is to become bitter and resentful and hostile.

894
01:18:24,983 --> 01:18:33,516
Well then, whatever hell you're in, merely as a consequence of the confluence of tragic events, you have opened a whole other hell underneath it,

895
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:41,550
the hell of bitterness and resentment and ingratitude, and well, that turns into the desire for revenge very, very quickly.

896
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:44,866
You think things are bad just because they're bad.

897
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:53,650
You wait till you see how bad they can become if you allow yourself to be corrupted by your unjust suffering, right?

898
01:18:54,183 --> 01:19:06,116
And so it's, and I do think that this is the most practical, possible advice that can be given to people, which is that you are morally required to maintain faith,

899
01:19:06,516 --> 01:19:12,466
to aim up, and to treat other people the way you would want to be treated, no matter what's happened to you.

900
01:19:13,366 --> 01:19:14,850
You know, and that's a hell of a thing to say.

901
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:17,183
And you know, you might say, well, that's impossible.

902
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,916
Some people have such brutal lives that they're destined to be corrupt, but I would say that's not true.

903
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:33,416
I've met many people, particularly in my clinical practice, who had lives that were so brutal that you couldn't even listen to them without it breaking you into pieces.

904
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:40,566
Brutal, brutal childhoods of a depth of malevolence you can hardly conceptualize.

905
01:19:41,066 --> 01:19:47,833
Who decided, despite that, that they were gonna aim up and they were going to maintain faith in themselves and the world.

906
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,266
And so it's like, that's on the table for people.

907
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:59,933
It seems like an odd paradox that the people who have been brought up under the lives of the most privileged are often the ones that have the most complaints about the world

908
01:19:59,966 --> 01:20:05,650
and people who have been brought up in deprivation a lot of the time are able to be perfectly in gratitude.

909
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:07,766
It seems very strange that that's the way.

910
01:20:08,283 --> 01:20:11,033
Yeah, well, having...

911
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:18,250
So one of the things I saw at the university, I saw the faculty members,

912
01:20:18,283 --> 01:20:28,483
my peers retreat in the face of the advancement of the administration over like three decades to the point where the universities really became corrupted.

913
01:20:28,566 --> 01:20:32,383
And it didn't really happen at Harvard when I was there in the 1990s,

914
01:20:33,183 --> 01:20:39,616
although it was starting to fray around the edges slightly, but I really watched it at the University of Toronto in the 20 years I was there.

915
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:47,033
The administration kept making demands on us, and every time they made a demand, we would fold.

916
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:48,950
Every time, 10,000 micro retreats.

917
01:20:50,116 --> 01:20:56,066
So then the administrators took over the university and then the woke types took over the administration and that was that.

918
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:01,850
Well, the reason, what I saw my faculty members do,

919
01:21:02,583 --> 01:21:06,616
the academics that I worked with is that this is how the corruption starts.

920
01:21:06,716 --> 01:21:11,966
It's like when you're an undergraduate, you write down what you think the professor wants to hear to get the grade.

921
01:21:12,516 --> 01:21:19,366
And then you're a graduate student, and you have to, let's say, get along with your professors and your supervisor.

922
01:21:19,383 --> 01:21:23,650
You have to tell them what you think they wanna hear so that you can get your PhD.

923
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:28,500
And then maybe you are on the academic track and you're an assistant professor.

924
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,100
There's three levels of being a professor.

925
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:31,566
You're not tenured as an assistant.

926
01:21:31,583 --> 01:21:38,133
So you really can't say what you think or do what you think you should do then because you have to get tenured.

927
01:21:38,183 --> 01:21:41,033
And then when you're tenured, well, you're not a full professor yet.

928
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:43,716
And so you don't speak then.

929
01:21:43,883 --> 01:21:46,366
And back in the back of your mind, you have this idea,

930
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:53,150
well, at some point I'll have enough security so that I'll be able to tell the truth.

931
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:59,133
But that's based on this weird idea that the courage to tell the truth is based on security.

932
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:02,116
Well, courage isn't based on security.

933
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:03,650
That's a stupid theory.

934
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:06,033
You're not courageous if there's no risk.

935
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:12,166
So your notion is you'll be courageous when there's zero risk.

936
01:22:12,666 --> 01:22:15,433
Well, obviously that's a contradiction in terms.

937
01:22:15,783 --> 01:22:17,616
You're only courageous if there's a risk.

938
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:29,116
And not only that, by the time you've sacrificed your word for illusory security for 15 years, there's nothing left of you that's true.

939
01:22:29,866 --> 01:22:31,700
You've already, that's gone.

940
01:22:31,766 --> 01:22:42,283
A long time ago, you probably looked back at the former self who was naive and thought that you could say what you think as just, well, you're cynical about it.

941
01:22:42,766 --> 01:22:46,250
You know, that person just didn't know how the way, didn't know how the world worked.

942
01:22:46,516 --> 01:22:49,233
And then it's the same thing that you pointed out.

943
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:59,750
The idea that you become good because you have material plenty, that's a silly idea.

944
01:23:00,383 --> 01:23:01,533
Why would that be the case?

945
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,950
It's like the same as assuming that all rich people have got taste.

946
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:05,583
Right, right.

947
01:23:05,883 --> 01:23:12,500
Poor people who've got beautifully designed interiors and rich people who've got gaudy messes.

948
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:14,183
Right, right, right, right.

949
01:23:14,416 --> 01:23:14,716
There was a-

950
01:23:15,266 --> 01:23:16,550
Yeah, well then the poor people are actually rich.

951
01:23:17,916 --> 01:23:18,383
Absolutely.

952
01:23:18,983 --> 01:23:22,116
There's a report, I wanted to bring this to you, so interesting.

953
01:23:22,466 --> 01:23:29,533
So a recent report was released by the Harvard Graduate School of Education detailing the drivers of anxiety for young adults aged 18 to 25.

954
01:23:31,966 --> 01:23:38,366
34% reported feelings of loneliness, 51% said achievement pressure negatively impacted their mental health.

955
01:23:39,683 --> 01:23:43,450
58% reported lacking meaning or purpose in their lives in the last month.

956
01:23:44,216 --> 01:23:49,383
50% reported their mental health was negatively influenced by not knowing what to do with my life.

957
01:23:49,783 --> 01:23:52,883
There has been much examination of the wellbeing of teens aged 14 to 17.

958
01:23:54,066 --> 01:23:58,150
Not much has been known about those occupying the critical young adult years.

959
01:23:58,350 --> 01:24:06,766
And yet, young adults report roughly twice the rates of anxiety and depression as teens, the young adults are not okay.

960
01:24:08,616 --> 01:24:09,400
Yeah, I believe that.

961
01:24:10,066 --> 01:24:22,316
I saw even with my own kids that the, like when I was a kid, probably the time between 13 and 15 was the most difficult transition, but I saw that become older.

962
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:25,850
By the time my kids, my kids are 30 now basically,

963
01:24:26,783 --> 01:24:34,916
by the time my kids were young adults, I could see that that transition into adulthood was the place where the difficulties were starting to mount.

964
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:47,366
I think, perversely, that the therapeutic world has a fair bit to do with this, partly because therapists,

965
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:54,616
who are basically secular, liberal Protestants, that's a good way of thinking about them,

966
01:24:55,300 --> 01:25:00,166
tend to conceptualize mental health as mental, as subjective, right?

967
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:04,833
is that mental health is something you carry around in your head, like you carry around your identity.

968
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:09,133
That's why we have these ridiculous ideas that you can just define your own identity.

969
01:25:09,516 --> 01:25:10,983
I am whoever I say I am.

970
01:25:11,316 --> 01:25:13,433
Well, obviously you're not because other people,

971
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:19,800
other people have to go along with your game, their buddy, and they're either gonna do that, they're not gonna do it,

972
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:24,083
or they're gonna do it voluntarily, or they're gonna do it by force.

973
01:25:24,766 --> 01:25:26,516
If they're not gonna do it, you're screwed.

974
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:29,016
If you have to use force, that's not gonna work.

975
01:25:29,466 --> 01:25:34,183
And if you want them to do it voluntarily, then it's not gonna be all about you, obviously.

976
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:41,000
Even no four-year-old can find someone to play with if he always gets to pick the game.

977
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:46,500
Okay, so why might young adults be lost?

978
01:25:46,666 --> 01:25:54,133
Well, part of it is that they're thinking, I'm not trying to be judgmental of a whole generation.

979
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,216
It's a form of thought.

980
01:25:58,366 --> 01:26:00,633
Your mental health isn't dependent on you.

981
01:26:02,416 --> 01:26:03,900
That's not the right way to think about it.

982
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:11,233
I don't think you can be mentally healthy in the absence of a long-term stable relationship.

983
01:26:12,150 --> 01:26:13,433
So you have to be married.

984
01:26:14,683 --> 01:26:20,050
Let's make that part of the precondition for successful adaptation as a young adult.

985
01:26:20,316 --> 01:26:21,116
You have to be married.

986
01:26:22,083 --> 01:26:26,883
So you have to establish a relationship with someone that integrates sexuality that's there for the long run.

987
01:26:27,566 --> 01:26:31,000
Because there for the long run is the same as sane.

988
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:37,900
There for tomorrow, there for the next minute, that's not sanity, that's impulsiveness.

989
01:26:38,616 --> 01:26:41,183
That's aimlessness, they're the same thing.

990
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:52,383
If it's all about what you want right now, or more accurately, all about what something in you wants this moment, that's the definition of immature insanity.

991
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:58,666
You have to commit, so you commit to someone else, you commit to your family, you commit to your community.

992
01:26:59,166 --> 01:27:02,916
There are multiple levels of identity that stretch out into the social world,

993
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:10,633
and voluntarily adopting those levels of hierarchical responsibility gives you an identity.

994
01:27:11,016 --> 01:27:13,850
It gives you a purpose, it protects you from anxiety.

995
01:27:13,883 --> 01:27:15,166
It does that in all sorts of ways.

996
01:27:16,316 --> 01:27:23,650
You said earlier that one of the things you do is seek for validation, and you related that to uncomfortable experiences you had when you were very young.

997
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,416
Well, it might not be precisely that you're seeking for validation.

998
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:37,850
You might be properly investigating how you should be embedded in a social hierarchy at every possible level.

999
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:43,116
It's like, well, people think their mental health is something that they just carry around in their head

1000
01:27:43,466 --> 01:27:50,483
and that if they just got the way they looked at the world right or if other people just played their game that all of a sudden they'd be mentally healthy.

1001
01:27:50,566 --> 01:27:56,800
It's like, there's no difference between thinking about yourself and being miserable.

1002
01:27:57,883 --> 01:28:09,333
Technically, if you look at, you can group descriptive statements about yourself statistically.

1003
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:20,183
All the descriptive, all the descriptors that are reflective of self-consciousness load on negative emotion.

1004
01:28:20,733 --> 01:28:21,100
And we know that.

1005
01:28:21,416 --> 01:28:22,616
Can you not think about yourself in a positive way?

1006
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:25,366
Probably not.

1007
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:26,466
Really?

1008
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:27,150
Not.

1009
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:30,683
Well, let's take that apart.

1010
01:28:32,816 --> 01:28:35,150
You like doing your podcast and you feel positive about it.

1011
01:28:35,483 --> 01:28:37,533
Okay, but your podcast isn't about you, right?

1012
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:45,833
So if you're thinking about how you're of utility to a broad number of people,

1013
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:52,133
You know, maybe you would take some satisfaction in that, but that isn't exactly thinking about yourself, is it?

1014
01:28:52,450 --> 01:28:57,366
It's thinking about the relationship you've established with other people, and it's a relationship of responsibility.

1015
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,166
Why do you like your podcast?

1016
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:03,800
You can pursue what you're curious about, but you wouldn't have to do that publicly.

1017
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,966
Okay, so why do you do it publicly?

1018
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:08,883
For a few reasons.

1019
01:29:09,166 --> 01:29:11,783
First one being that it keeps me accountable.

1020
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:19,083
That was one of the main reasons, that it kept me accountable, because I knew that if I didn't do it, if I wasn't rigorous and precise,

1021
01:29:19,816 --> 01:29:26,700
and aligned with what I'd said and done previously, that there was an external eye that's watching.

1022
01:29:27,183 --> 01:29:30,000
Okay, okay, okay, so well, that's very interesting.

1023
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:33,333
So I would also say, that's not exactly about you.

1024
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:41,033
That's about your ability to live, to establish harmony between what you say and the way you act,

1025
01:29:41,516 --> 01:29:48,300
and the expectations that an increasingly broad social community has a view as a consequence of what you say and how you act.

1026
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,133
Okay, that's not about you.

1027
01:29:50,650 --> 01:29:54,683
That's about your nesting in a social hierarchy, right?

1028
01:29:54,766 --> 01:30:03,200
And so I think you can, and then you might say too, well, maybe you're thinking about yourself when you're establishing an aim or a goal.

1029
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:08,833
Well, not if they're good aims or goals, because if they're good aims or goals,

1030
01:30:10,033 --> 01:30:20,200
and I would say what good means technically is an aim or goal that will play out well in the medium to long term,

1031
01:30:21,466 --> 01:30:25,933
across a multitude of situations, including many, many people.

1032
01:30:26,416 --> 01:30:36,650
So a solution that iterates across time, and that is situation independent,

1033
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:41,316
and that's broadly socially inclusive, is a better aim, right?

1034
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:43,183
It's a higher aim, because it integrates more.

1035
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:51,583
All right, now, you might want to be setting up aims and you might be pleased about how you're progressing in relation to those aims.

1036
01:30:51,683 --> 01:30:57,783
But if those aims aren't, don't have the characteristics that I just described, then,

1037
01:31:01,566 --> 01:31:05,416
if the aims have the characteristics I just described, they're not about you.

1038
01:31:05,916 --> 01:31:07,900
And then we could also ask, what do you mean about you?

1039
01:31:08,983 --> 01:31:11,550
Exactly, what you are you talking about here?

1040
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:18,933
You know, and so we play these identity games in the modern world that are making people anxious and hopeless.

1041
01:31:19,450 --> 01:31:23,566
And one identity game is, I'm defined by my sexuality.

1042
01:31:23,983 --> 01:31:26,533
Okay, so let's take that, I'm defined by my sexuality.

1043
01:31:26,616 --> 01:31:29,050
Okay, but what do you mean by your sexuality exactly?

1044
01:31:30,016 --> 01:31:33,766
Do you mean the opportunity to engage in sex?

1045
01:31:34,216 --> 01:31:37,966
Like are you reducing sexuality as such to the act of sex?

1046
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:39,566
Okay, let's say you are.

1047
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:45,033
So now what you're telling me is that who you are is who you are when you're sexually desirous.

1048
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:48,050
That's what you've reduced yourself to, but it's even more than that.

1049
01:31:48,666 --> 01:31:52,716
It's the kind of sexual desire that wants gratification right now

1050
01:31:53,616 --> 01:31:55,400
with no relationship whatsoever.

1051
01:31:55,483 --> 01:32:04,850
So not only have you now reduced who you are to your sexual desire, you've reduced your sexual desire to the minimal set of preconditions that would satisfy it.

1052
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:07,066
Well, then the first question that might come up there is

1053
01:32:07,383 --> 01:32:08,600
Why not just use porn?

1054
01:32:09,350 --> 01:32:10,216
It's a lot simpler.

1055
01:32:10,516 --> 01:32:12,966
And the answer to that is, that is what people are doing.

1056
01:32:13,283 --> 01:32:20,666
Well, it's no wonder that they're anxious and lonesome and aimless, because they've reduced themselves to a short-term desire.

1057
01:32:20,783 --> 01:32:23,066
They've found the easiest possible way of gratifying that,

1058
01:32:23,466 --> 01:32:31,900
and they've abandoned everything that would be a much broader conceptualization of what sexuality would be if it was embedded properly in,

1059
01:32:32,766 --> 01:32:34,950
well, how about a relationship to start with?

1060
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:39,333
And I'm not just, these aren't just opinions.

1061
01:32:40,283 --> 01:32:47,900
So there are two different strategies of reproduction broadly in the animal world.

1062
01:32:48,583 --> 01:32:51,716
One is zero investment.

1063
01:32:52,916 --> 01:32:58,583
Fish, mosquitoes, million offspring, they all die but one, right?

1064
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:02,183
So you can reduce reproduction in mosquitoes basically to sex.

1065
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:09,016
And you make a million mosquito offspring, all you need is one to survive, problem solved, okay.

1066
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:12,166
On the opposite end of the spectrum, literally, are human beings.

1067
01:33:13,066 --> 01:33:17,250
Because we have the longest dependency period of any animal, by a large margin.

1068
01:33:17,766 --> 01:33:21,600
We have a high investment strategy, sexual reproduction strategy.

1069
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,633
So whatever sex is for human beings isn't, you're off and that's over.

1070
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:28,400
That's not what it is for human beings.

1071
01:33:28,466 --> 01:33:29,833
It's embedded in a relationship.

1072
01:33:30,283 --> 01:33:37,750
Now you might say, well, we could pull sexuality out of the relationship and just indulge in it for the pleasure.

1073
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,166
Okay, so now let's forget about all the other animals.

1074
01:33:40,283 --> 01:33:42,383
Now we've got two types of human being.

1075
01:33:42,416 --> 01:33:46,500
We've got the one-night stand human being, repetitive one-night stands,

1076
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,416
and we've got the long-term committed relationship human being.

1077
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:55,633
And then we might ask, okay, what are the personality characteristics of the people in those bins?

1078
01:33:56,383 --> 01:34:01,550
So let's go to the short-term one-night stand sequential relationship types.

1079
01:34:02,116 --> 01:34:03,050
Okay, who are they?

1080
01:34:04,283 --> 01:34:08,916
Psychopathic, narcissistic, Machiavellian, and sadistic.

1081
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:10,783
All one night stand people?

1082
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:16,316
If they don't start out that way, they're gonna end that way.

1083
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:21,883
Right, because you can't use yourself or other people for short-term gratification.

1084
01:34:23,266 --> 01:34:27,800
The definition of a psychopath is someone who uses someone for short-term gratification.

1085
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:30,933
Okay, so it's definitional, right?

1086
01:34:31,566 --> 01:34:34,166
And then you might say, well, I'm not like that, I just like sex.

1087
01:34:34,350 --> 01:34:41,766
It's like, yeah, but if you practice that for five years, you're not gonna become what you practice, you know?

1088
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:46,800
And I talked to Russell Brand about this a little bit,

1089
01:34:49,066 --> 01:34:54,333
and I can say this because it was on his podcast, so it's not like this is secret, you know?

1090
01:34:55,166 --> 01:34:58,000
Russell had what Andrew Tate promises his followers.

1091
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:07,083
He had fame, he was charismatic, and he had more or less unlimited access to short-term sexual gratification.

1092
01:35:07,716 --> 01:35:15,650
Okay, in combination with the chemicals that make that even more likely, alcohol and cocaine, let's say.

1093
01:35:19,283 --> 01:35:20,366
So what are the consequences?

1094
01:35:20,816 --> 01:35:22,350
Well, I asked him, what were the consequences?

1095
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:22,866
You had this.

1096
01:35:23,283 --> 01:35:26,333
He said, despair, anxiety, and hopelessness.

1097
01:35:27,483 --> 01:35:34,550
Right, but not just that, because Russell got himself in trouble here a month and a half ago, just about took him out.

1098
01:35:35,366 --> 01:35:37,350
Well, it was his past coming back to haunt him.

1099
01:35:37,466 --> 01:35:45,533
Like, and he had to scroll through his psyche and see, you know, well, with all these short-term relationships,

1100
01:35:47,216 --> 01:35:54,050
these short-term sexual gratification binges that I indulged in, did I ever cross the line?

1101
01:35:54,316 --> 01:35:59,250
Well, the answer is, well, you're gonna have like 200 encounters like that.

1102
01:35:59,316 --> 01:36:07,183
You're not gonna cross the line when you're drunk, when you're on cocaine, you're gonna cross a bunch of lines and then it's gonna come back and haunt you.

1103
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:24,683
And so it's very interesting to see in our culture back to the hopelessness and despair that you were mentioning that's characterizing young adults life.

1104
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:27,616
It's like, well, it's all about me.

1105
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,433
That's the self-esteem movement.

1106
01:36:29,466 --> 01:36:31,750
But then me becomes, it's all about what I want.

1107
01:36:31,983 --> 01:36:34,683
And then that becomes, it's all about what I want right now.

1108
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:40,250
Then it's what the lowest part of me wants right now and to hell with everyone else.

1109
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:45,650
It's like, okay, how are you gonna play that game without being desperate?

1110
01:36:46,166 --> 01:36:48,283
You're gonna be desperate as soon as you start playing that game.

1111
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:55,966
And the other thing, it's even worse than that because you're gonna end up with the Jeremy, the porn star problem.

1112
01:36:56,783 --> 01:37:01,600
Anybody, you're not gonna be very happy about being with the people who wanna play that game with you.

1113
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:06,766
Because they're not gonna be the people that are really gonna make you feel that life is worth living.

1114
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:10,483
They're gonna be the people, especially on the female side,

1115
01:37:12,183 --> 01:37:15,966
women who are willing to take advantage of themselves for short-term sexual gratification.

1116
01:37:16,550 --> 01:37:17,533
Those aren't happy women.

1117
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,266
They're usually damaged women.

1118
01:37:21,350 --> 01:37:26,233
And if they're not damaged when they start playing that game they're gonna be plenty damaged by the time they're done with it.

1119
01:37:26,866 --> 01:37:29,916
The last time that we spoke, me and you talked about population decline

1120
01:37:30,766 --> 01:37:38,483
and the Census Bureau just released today predicting that the US population will decline for the first time ever by the year 2100 after peaking in 2080.

1121
01:37:40,150 --> 01:37:45,833
So their estimates showed that the US population which is about 333 million at the moment is expected to reach 370 by 2080

1122
01:37:47,916 --> 01:37:55,183
but will be back down to 366 by 2100 and even immigration can't offset this birth rate decline.

1123
01:37:57,083 --> 01:38:05,116
over the last two years, do you think things have got better or worse than you anticipated from birth rate and marriage rate standpoint?

1124
01:38:05,183 --> 01:38:06,933
I think they're probably still getting worse.

1125
01:38:09,766 --> 01:38:16,600
And I think Musk is one of the few people, Elon Musk is one of the, in case anybody was wondering,

1126
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:26,783
he's one of the few people who's called out the danger of a one-child policy or the idea that we should decrease the population.

1127
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:35,766
I mean, things that don't grow die, but they die for all sorts of reasons, and we can tie this back to identity.

1128
01:38:36,883 --> 01:38:38,150
You know, what's my identity?

1129
01:38:38,566 --> 01:38:40,316
I could say, well, it's how I feel about myself.

1130
01:38:40,716 --> 01:38:42,483
That's the line that's used everywhere now.

1131
01:38:43,183 --> 01:38:44,900
You don't get to tell me who I am.

1132
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:48,633
I know who I am, I'm who I feel I am.

1133
01:38:48,850 --> 01:38:50,733
Well, first of all, I don't even know what you mean by feel.

1134
01:38:50,950 --> 01:38:51,516
Like, what the hell?

1135
01:38:51,866 --> 01:38:52,716
What does that mean?

1136
01:38:53,416 --> 01:38:58,683
You're your emotional state at the moment and you can just impose that on everybody.

1137
01:38:58,766 --> 01:38:59,783
That's your theory, is it?

1138
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:02,200
That's the theory of a two-year-old, literally.

1139
01:39:02,616 --> 01:39:03,900
That's a very bad theory.

1140
01:39:04,850 --> 01:39:05,000
Well,

1141
01:39:09,383 --> 01:39:11,533
where could your identity be other than that?

1142
01:39:11,666 --> 01:39:21,650
Well, one of my identities when I taught at Harvard was professor, obviously, and that was a good identity, but that wasn't exactly, it wasn't something I was carrying around in my head.

1143
01:39:22,366 --> 01:39:26,650
It was a pattern of relationship that I had with a whole bunch of people, all my students.

1144
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:29,133
It wasn't inside my head.

1145
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:37,483
Now, there was a concordance between my representation of myself and how I was acting in the world, and that concordance was the health.

1146
01:39:38,350 --> 01:39:40,000
It wasn't what I thought of myself.

1147
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:45,850
Part of the reason that you can take some,

1148
01:39:46,466 --> 01:39:47,766
let's call it gratification,

1149
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:53,683
from being a successful podcaster is that you're actually a successful podcaster.

1150
01:39:53,966 --> 01:39:55,033
It's not in your head.

1151
01:39:56,066 --> 01:39:58,300
It's in 1.5 million subscribers.

1152
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:59,850
It's, how many podcasts have you done?

1153
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,833
700.

1154
01:40:00,850 --> 01:40:01,950
Okay, so it's in 700 podcasts.

1155
01:40:02,716 --> 01:40:04,966
It's not something you're carrying around in your head.

1156
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:11,583
Do you remember, I loved the 42 rules that created the 24 that you ended up coming up with, but there's one that you didn't use.

1157
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:18,000
If you have to choose, be the one who does things, not the one who is seen to do things.

1158
01:40:18,050 --> 01:40:19,083
Exactly, absolutely.

1159
01:40:19,183 --> 01:40:20,033
I loved that rule.

1160
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:21,383
Oh yeah, that's a great rule.

1161
01:40:21,883 --> 01:40:22,683
That's a great rule.

1162
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:29,633
Yeah, well, the thing is is that you can do almost anything you want if you're willing to take responsibility for it if you don't want credit.

1163
01:40:29,716 --> 01:40:35,650
One of the most effective political maneuvers I've ever seen, woman who's, she's so brilliant.

1164
01:40:35,716 --> 01:40:37,583
I won't tell you who she is, but she's so sharp.

1165
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:38,466
She's so brilliant.

1166
01:40:38,816 --> 01:40:40,383
And she told me the last time I saw her,

1167
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:42,816
she's had her finger in pies for like 30 years,

1168
01:40:43,650 --> 01:40:45,400
popping up in places you'd never expect.

1169
01:40:45,566 --> 01:40:48,350
I thought, I asked her, it's like, how the hell did you pull this off?

1170
01:40:48,416 --> 01:40:53,683
And she said, oh, I decided 30 years ago that I could do whatever I wanted if I didn't want credit.

1171
01:40:54,666 --> 01:40:56,183
And so that's exactly what she's done.

1172
01:40:56,650 --> 01:40:59,483
And she's had a stellar career, stellar.

1173
01:41:00,050 --> 01:41:02,116
And I've worked with other people who've done the same thing.

1174
01:41:02,416 --> 01:41:03,400
It's very interesting.

1175
01:41:03,950 --> 01:41:05,866
It's very interesting thing to realize.

1176
01:41:06,350 --> 01:41:09,400
You might say, well, why would I want the responsibility without the glory?

1177
01:41:09,516 --> 01:41:10,966
It's like, hey, do you want the glory?

1178
01:41:11,150 --> 01:41:13,300
Are you so sure that that wouldn't just get in your way?

1179
01:41:14,166 --> 01:41:16,083
You know, there's something to be said for anonymity.

1180
01:41:16,516 --> 01:41:20,083
And second, maybe you want the responsibility because that's the adventure.

1181
01:41:20,350 --> 01:41:24,333
You actually get to do the thing that someone else just wants to take credit for.

1182
01:41:24,766 --> 01:41:31,333
Well, maybe doing the thing is plenty of reward in and of itself with regard to identity.

1183
01:41:32,683 --> 01:41:37,300
You know, when I was a professor, I was also a husband and I was also a father.

1184
01:41:37,666 --> 01:41:40,450
Well, those were identities, but they weren't in my head.

1185
01:41:41,216 --> 01:41:44,966
They were embedded in the relationship I had with my kids and that was a meaningful relationship.

1186
01:41:45,083 --> 01:41:46,916
embedded in the relationship I had with my wife.

1187
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:52,233
You can't be, you know, it's almost heretical to say this in the modern world.

1188
01:41:54,250 --> 01:42:05,983
You can't be isolated, alone, without responsibility and pursuing your hedonistic nonsense and not be insane and miserable.

1189
01:42:06,583 --> 01:42:09,566
Those are all the same thing, right?

1190
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:17,716
And so, you know, it's got to the point, I've said things that have made me somewhat unpopular, like it's very difficult for people to mature until they have a child.

1191
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:27,216
You find a huge part of what you are in that relationship.

1192
01:42:27,416 --> 01:42:29,366
It makes you responsible, makes you grow up.

1193
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:31,200
It gives you the opportunity to mentor someone.

1194
01:42:31,950 --> 01:42:33,800
You have someone around who's more important than you.

1195
01:42:34,566 --> 01:42:36,233
Well, that's part of being mentally healthy.

1196
01:42:37,083 --> 01:42:38,166
It's a huge part of it.

1197
01:42:39,183 --> 01:42:43,233
This is, this enterprise that I've put together in London, help put together.

1198
01:42:43,883 --> 01:42:48,116
Alliance for Responsible Citizenship, we're trying to put forward a model of governance.

1199
01:42:49,416 --> 01:42:57,683
It's called a subsidiary model, and the idea is that people have multiple social roles that scale, you know, there's you,

1200
01:42:58,450 --> 01:43:07,033
take care of yourself, integrate yourself, which means you can conduct yourself properly across the medium to long run, you're self-sustaining,

1201
01:43:07,550 --> 01:43:09,933
then you can maybe extend that to your partner,

1202
01:43:10,383 --> 01:43:19,633
and then to your family and then to your local community and then to broader communities as you become more and more competent and able to take on that responsibility.

1203
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:23,950
That's the alternative to isolated hedonic slavery.

1204
01:43:24,566 --> 01:43:31,000
You slave to your own whims and it's the alternative to tyranny because if you take on all that responsibility,

1205
01:43:31,483 --> 01:43:33,533
you don't have any need for someone to govern you.

1206
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:41,400
And so that's another example of how I blamed it on the therapists a little bit.

1207
01:43:41,483 --> 01:43:45,250
I called them liberal Protestant secularists.

1208
01:43:46,083 --> 01:43:55,250
And that's because they think about the locus of the psyche as interior, subjective.

1209
01:43:55,366 --> 01:43:56,350
That's what a liberal would do.

1210
01:43:57,100 --> 01:43:58,650
It's just not accurate.

1211
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:01,816
That isn't the way the psyche works.

1212
01:44:02,266 --> 01:44:05,250
It's not in your head, you know?

1213
01:44:05,483 --> 01:44:17,216
It's in your head and in the world. at the same time, it's truly the case that your sanity is the concordance between you as an individual and the world.

1214
01:44:17,683 --> 01:44:18,633
That's the sanity.

1215
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:25,466
It's not the proper structuring of your psyche or your brain, for that matter, inside your skull.

1216
01:44:26,050 --> 01:44:27,616
You're distributed out into the world.

1217
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:29,150
And you should be.

1218
01:44:29,350 --> 01:44:30,733
And that's, you wanna be.

1219
01:44:31,366 --> 01:44:32,433
That's where the adventure is.

1220
01:44:32,916 --> 01:44:34,150
You wanna be solipsistic?

1221
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:37,216
A solipsistic porn masturbator.

1222
01:44:37,816 --> 01:44:40,383
Jesus, it's no wonder you're being aimless and miserable.

1223
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:42,850
Well, God, it's so pathetic.

1224
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:44,783
Why am I so unhappy?

1225
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,550
It's because you think about yourself.

1226
01:44:47,383 --> 01:44:52,750
No, you think about the lowest impulses in yourself all the time.

1227
01:44:53,383 --> 01:44:54,216
That's why you're miserable.

1228
01:44:55,616 --> 01:45:01,700
Whilst being at Arc, what I thought was particularly interesting was your live event that you guys did at the O2 on the evening time.

1229
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:08,816
And everyone was great, But Douglas, I thought, was just a tour de force that evening.

1230
01:45:09,383 --> 01:45:12,133
What have you learned since being friends with Douglas?

1231
01:45:12,183 --> 01:45:14,116
How has he impacted you or influenced you?

1232
01:45:16,066 --> 01:45:19,516
Well, Douglas is very, very disagreeable.

1233
01:45:20,983 --> 01:45:24,300
You know, and he enjoys combat.

1234
01:45:25,266 --> 01:45:29,550
And that isn't something that really characterizes, I don't enjoy combat at all.

1235
01:45:30,616 --> 01:45:33,300
Part of the reason that it's perverse, I suppose,

1236
01:45:34,016 --> 01:45:43,950
in some ways, part of the reason that I will engage in difficult conversations is because I don't wanna have them forever.

1237
01:45:45,350 --> 01:45:47,633
And so, you know, one of the rules I had in my marriage,

1238
01:45:48,383 --> 01:45:55,683
and it was a rule that my wife also was pleased to follow, was that if we have a problem, we're gonna deal with it right now,

1239
01:45:56,266 --> 01:45:58,400
and we're gonna deal with it right to the bottom.

1240
01:45:59,516 --> 01:46:01,533
And that's very unpleasant.

1241
01:46:01,766 --> 01:46:10,316
But if you do it, sometimes you only have to do it once and the problem goes away and then you don't have that bloody problem every day for the rest of your life.

1242
01:46:10,950 --> 01:46:16,716
And sometimes it takes 20 times before it's fixed, before you've got to the bottom of things.

1243
01:46:17,550 --> 01:46:19,116
And that can be very unpleasant.

1244
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:26,650
Douglas is very, very good at not letting people off the hook.

1245
01:46:27,583 --> 01:46:28,316
He's very tough.

1246
01:46:28,866 --> 01:46:31,000
and he's very good at defending himself.

1247
01:46:31,650 --> 01:46:38,433
And there's a pitilessness about him that's extraordinarily admirable.

1248
01:46:38,683 --> 01:46:41,533
It's a judicious pitilessness, you know?

1249
01:46:41,683 --> 01:46:47,300
And it's a dangerous game to play because there's another gospel realization, let's say,

1250
01:46:47,783 --> 01:46:53,366
is the standards you judge other people by will be the standards that you yourself are judged by.

1251
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:55,183
And the reason for that is, well,

1252
01:46:55,750 --> 01:47:00,350
how are you gonna judge everyone else and not apply the same standards to yourself.

1253
01:47:01,066 --> 01:47:05,800
Like that's not gonna happen because you become what you practice and you'll turn the eye,

1254
01:47:06,116 --> 01:47:09,833
the hostile eye that you turn on others, you will absolutely turn on yourself.

1255
01:47:10,416 --> 01:47:11,383
There's no way around that.

1256
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:15,500
And so Douglas plays a dangerous game because he's very combative.

1257
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:18,233
But he's also extremely careful.

1258
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:19,816
He's very careful with his words.

1259
01:47:20,316 --> 01:47:23,600
And we've had a, he toured with me through Europe.

1260
01:47:24,450 --> 01:47:25,833
I think we did nine shows together.

1261
01:47:26,366 --> 01:47:27,350
We split the Q&A.

1262
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:31,383
He did a little bit of an introduction before my lectures.

1263
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:33,650
I really liked it, I thought it was great.

1264
01:47:34,050 --> 01:47:35,533
It's been a privilege to get to know him.

1265
01:47:35,983 --> 01:47:40,750
Super sharp, very cultured person, very witty.

1266
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:48,450
So he has a great sense of humor, which is also fun, which also is one of the things that makes him a very dangerous opponent in a debate.

1267
01:47:48,950 --> 01:47:52,533
Because not only does he have the facts at hand,

1268
01:47:53,483 --> 01:47:59,300
like Bjorn Lomborg, but he's devastatingly witty and cutting and it's fun to watch that.

1269
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:00,650
He's a master at it so.

1270
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:10,833
It was, it's interesting to think about the fact that all you need really in a live debate, I think I learned this from you and Sam ages ago.

1271
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:23,983
If you're doing a live debate now that's not a proper intellectual formatted opening remarks on and so forth, if you manage to get sort of two or three real zingers, you won, regardless of the content.

1272
01:48:24,216 --> 01:48:28,150
If you do two or three real zinger, whole crowd laughs,

1273
01:48:28,883 --> 01:48:34,466
guess what, you've got to- Yeah, well, the great public intellectuals have a vicious sense of humor, right?

1274
01:48:34,783 --> 01:48:38,916
And I mean, I also think that's why so many of the successful podcasters have been comedians.

1275
01:48:39,583 --> 01:48:47,200
Well, at the ARC conference, I think Constantine Kissen's speech was the overwhelming hit of the convention.

1276
01:48:47,950 --> 01:48:54,900
I think it's got 600,000 views as of today, 650, on the ARK side and about 600 on his own channel.

1277
01:48:55,316 --> 01:49:01,300
And Konstantin did a beautiful job of merging intellectual content with wit.

1278
01:49:01,683 --> 01:49:05,983
Well, the thing, the interesting thing about my live tour that I'm about to start doing,

1279
01:49:06,366 --> 01:49:13,916
bunch of my comedian friends have said to me, dude, I am so jealous of the tour that you get to do because no one's expecting you to be funny.

1280
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:18,283
If you manage to be funny four times in 90 minutes, you've killed.

1281
01:49:18,683 --> 01:49:22,250
If I'm not funny once every seven seconds, I'm a shit comedian.

1282
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:31,116
So the bar is set and obviously coming in with Constantine's background of comedy means that he is able to be by far the,

1283
01:49:32,183 --> 01:49:34,233
far and away way funnier than most public speakers,

1284
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:41,016
but doesn't get held necessarily to the same standards that he's not expecting to be one-liners all the time.

1285
01:49:41,416 --> 01:49:51,500
One of the things that Douglas brought up when you guys were talking on stage that I thought was particularly interesting was the perils of smart people getting captured by culture wars bullshit.

1286
01:49:52,383 --> 01:50:00,966
Do you ever think about how much time over the last decade some of the smartest people on the planet have had their attention, their cognitive horsepower

1287
01:50:01,366 --> 01:50:08,900
just taken away arguing about whether men are men and women are women or not, or whatever the idea du jour of the day is.

1288
01:50:09,550 --> 01:50:11,116
Just how much time's been lost.

1289
01:50:11,166 --> 01:50:17,300
So I've been partnering with The Daily Wire for about a year and a half so far, and that's been very successful.

1290
01:50:17,666 --> 01:50:18,816
They've been a pleasure to work with.

1291
01:50:19,366 --> 01:50:24,133
But what they wrestle with constantly, all of them, all of the principles,

1292
01:50:24,850 --> 01:50:33,616
all of the principles at Daily Wire would rather in some real way be concentrating on philosophical, theological, or dramatic matters.

1293
01:50:34,466 --> 01:50:40,383
So which is partly why the Daily Wire is turning towards entertainment for kids, but also for adults.

1294
01:50:40,683 --> 01:50:42,866
Starting to make movies, for example, and TV shows.

1295
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,300
They'd rather be doing that.

1296
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:55,533
I had Ben Shapiro, he participated in this seminar on Exodus that I produced with about nine other extraordinarily interesting thinkers.

1297
01:50:56,450 --> 01:51:00,183
And Ben just shone, you know, he's wasted.

1298
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:03,233
Is he wasted on the political?

1299
01:51:05,916 --> 01:51:11,100
The political's necessary, but it's one nation under God for a reason,

1300
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:14,066
because the political, the political isn't the pinnacle,

1301
01:51:14,350 --> 01:51:15,633
Never, it's never the pinnacle.

1302
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:21,750
And if you're capable of discourse at the pinnacle, political discourse is secondary.

1303
01:51:22,066 --> 01:51:23,483
And it's also evanescent, right?

1304
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:25,883
There's ways that it can tumble as well.

1305
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:31,133
There's, how would you say, degrees of depth of political stuff too.

1306
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:38,516
Because what works on YouTube a lot of the time is it reacts to insane woke TikToks or does whatever.

1307
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:40,433
And it's easy to get pigeonholed that way.

1308
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:41,766
Yeah, yeah.

1309
01:51:41,883 --> 01:51:43,266
And it is, is it a waste?

1310
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:46,633
It's non-optimal.

1311
01:51:46,850 --> 01:51:53,700
But it's a question, it's an interesting question to be asked, right, about how much sort of ankle or skirt or knee do you need to show

1312
01:51:54,083 --> 01:52:01,450
from an algorithmic perspective in order to keep the numbers churning, because ultimately you're producing what people click on.

1313
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:07,966
You don't want to be completely beholden to your audience, that's audience capture, but you also don't want to be so unaware

1314
01:52:08,483 --> 01:52:12,450
of having your finger on the pulse of what is trendy that you become obscure and obsolete.

1315
01:52:12,716 --> 01:52:20,833
All right, well in that line that you're trying to walk when you're dealing with matters that are the highest

1316
01:52:21,550 --> 01:52:25,983
and also making them publicly accessible, that's a very, very tight line to walk.

1317
01:52:26,783 --> 01:52:32,733
I mean, Jonathan Paggio has done a good job of that, although his market is still relatively niche

1318
01:52:33,016 --> 01:52:43,550
and he certainly is more esoteric, let's say, than the Daily Wire guys who tend to devolve into the political and that devolves into the cheap political from time to time, right?

1319
01:52:43,616 --> 01:52:47,233
The hit for hit's sake or the chasing the algorithm.

1320
01:52:47,350 --> 01:52:55,433
And I mean, that's the danger that all politicians have too is that, and I've seen this with lots of political types who have developed a persona.

1321
01:52:56,500 --> 01:53:01,066
This is particularly true in the United States, I would say, because Americans are so salesman-y.

1322
01:53:01,450 --> 01:53:03,783
And I don't say that dismissively.

1323
01:53:04,283 --> 01:53:08,100
It's really hard to sell, to market, to communicate.

1324
01:53:09,316 --> 01:53:14,766
I saw the Elvis movie recently And I thought it did a beautiful job of laying this out because Elvis was a stellar talent.

1325
01:53:15,266 --> 01:53:19,183
But his manager, who was a real shyster, was also a stellar talent.

1326
01:53:19,583 --> 01:53:23,450
Like Elvis wouldn't have been who he was without his corrupt manager.

1327
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:28,016
And you know, it's sort of a deal with the devil, but you have to give the devil his due too.

1328
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:38,050
And the sales many part of American culture can easily devolve into a kind of narcissistic manipulativeness.

1329
01:53:38,766 --> 01:53:41,300
That's where it would go if it becomes pathological.

1330
01:53:41,416 --> 01:53:48,850
But as you said, you have to be aware of your audience and you have to be delivering what there's a market for.

1331
01:53:48,966 --> 01:53:51,616
And it's very difficult to get those things right.

1332
01:53:51,950 --> 01:53:55,150
This is a question that I've got about your new book coming out next year.

1333
01:53:55,616 --> 01:53:56,316
I haven't seen any of it.

1334
01:53:57,216 --> 01:54:04,600
And it sounds like based on what you're reading at the moment, you're trying to grapple with religious texts, especially the Bible, We Who Wrestle With God is the name of the book.

1335
01:54:04,650 --> 01:54:09,100
Yeah, We Who Wrestle With God, yeah, which is the, that's what the word Israel means.

1336
01:54:09,666 --> 01:54:11,516
Israel means we who wrestle with God.

1337
01:54:12,016 --> 01:54:18,050
And so, well it's very interesting because it means the chosen people are the people who wrestle with God.

1338
01:54:18,716 --> 01:54:20,433
And you might say, well who wrestles with God?

1339
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:22,783
And the answer to that is, well everyone wrestles with God.

1340
01:54:23,316 --> 01:54:23,933
Well why?

1341
01:54:24,466 --> 01:54:27,700
Because you can't act without making moral decisions.

1342
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:33,300
Like every step forward is predicated on a moral decision.

1343
01:54:33,833 --> 01:54:35,350
And so we're all wrestling with God.

1344
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,050
Is God a moral decision?

1345
01:54:42,633 --> 01:54:46,500
God is the spirit that guides you when you make the proper moral decisions.

1346
01:54:47,916 --> 01:54:49,933
So I wouldn't say God is a moral decision.

1347
01:54:50,116 --> 01:54:52,283
He's the spirit of moral decision.

1348
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:56,300
So that's actually not a bad definition.

1349
01:54:57,416 --> 01:55:05,466
Part of what I'm trying to do with this book is to point out that a lot of what's happening in the biblical corpus is actually definitional, right?

1350
01:55:05,833 --> 01:55:11,900
Well, people, modern people think the fundamental issue is do you believe in God?

1351
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:13,716
But that's not the fundamental issue.

1352
01:55:13,816 --> 01:55:16,000
The fundamental issue is what do you mean by God?

1353
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:20,150
And so let me give you an example of this that will make it clearer.

1354
01:55:20,566 --> 01:55:28,433
So there's a medieval idea that God is the summum bonum, which means the sum of all that's good or the essence of all that's good.

1355
01:55:29,133 --> 01:55:32,150
Okay, you might say, well, I don't believe in that.

1356
01:55:32,550 --> 01:55:35,633
Now remember, this is the definition of God, right?

1357
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:37,650
God is the sum of all that's good.

1358
01:55:38,316 --> 01:55:40,533
Okay, all right, so you don't believe in that.

1359
01:55:40,666 --> 01:55:41,833
All right, let's take that apart.

1360
01:55:43,166 --> 01:55:45,850
Do you believe that some things are better than other things?

1361
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:47,533
Well, people will say yes.

1362
01:55:47,650 --> 01:55:51,333
Okay, so then you believe that there is a scale of good.

1363
01:55:52,750 --> 01:55:57,333
Okay, is there something that all things that are good share in common?

1364
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:01,683
And the answer to that has to be yes, because otherwise you don't have a conception of good.

1365
01:56:02,433 --> 01:56:08,100
Right, the word good implies that across good things there's some essence.

1366
01:56:08,716 --> 01:56:12,916
Okay, well the one medieval definition of God is the essence of good.

1367
01:56:14,150 --> 01:56:16,166
Well, okay, let's say you don't believe in that.

1368
01:56:16,333 --> 01:56:19,483
Okay, does that mean you don't believe in anything that's good?

1369
01:56:20,533 --> 01:56:23,383
Okay, then how do you act then?

1370
01:56:23,550 --> 01:56:29,000
Because to act means to do something that's better than what you're doing now, right?

1371
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:32,433
There's no action without movement towards the good.

1372
01:56:32,950 --> 01:56:36,150
And what you might see, you might say, well, I don't believe that there's a unitary good.

1373
01:56:36,850 --> 01:56:39,100
Okay, you believe there's a fractionated good.

1374
01:56:39,366 --> 01:56:42,783
Well, then what do you do when those things oppose one another, right?

1375
01:56:42,833 --> 01:56:44,266
Which would be in a conflict of duty.

1376
01:56:44,666 --> 01:56:50,750
What, how do you refer to, what do you refer to to help you adjudicate between different goods?

1377
01:56:51,366 --> 01:56:53,483
Well, generally what you do is if you could pursue A,

1378
01:56:54,066 --> 01:56:59,100
which is good, or B, which is good, and they conflict, then you pick the higher good.

1379
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:01,000
Okay, do you believe in a higher good?

1380
01:57:01,650 --> 01:57:05,883
Well, if you don't, you can't decide between goods, which means you're paralyzed.

1381
01:57:06,533 --> 01:57:10,466
If you do believe in the higher good, then do you believe in the highest good?

1382
01:57:11,066 --> 01:57:12,250
Well, the highest good is God.

1383
01:57:12,933 --> 01:57:13,583
What do you mean by that?

1384
01:57:13,950 --> 01:57:14,900
By definition.

1385
01:57:15,950 --> 01:57:17,616
Okay, so now you have a definition.

1386
01:57:17,716 --> 01:57:19,483
Now, then the next question might be,

1387
01:57:20,266 --> 01:57:23,616
well, what's your relationship with the highest good?

1388
01:57:23,716 --> 01:57:25,500
And you might say, well, I don't have a relationship.

1389
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:29,133
It's like, well, actually you do because you act in relationship to it.

1390
01:57:29,416 --> 01:57:30,166
You can't help it.

1391
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:38,583
One of the interesting things about the biblical corpus is that it's based on the insistence

1392
01:57:39,216 --> 01:57:45,700
that you have a relationship with being and becoming, a relationship, like a personal relationship.

1393
01:57:45,750 --> 01:57:49,200
When you say biblical corpus, do you mean the collection of texts that makes up the Bible?

1394
01:57:49,216 --> 01:57:51,933
Yeah, because it's a library of books, essentially, right?

1395
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,383
The Bible is actually the first library of books.

1396
01:57:55,200 --> 01:58:04,166
It's written by a very large number of different people and aggregated over thousands of years and then sequenced, actually sequenced into a narrative,

1397
01:58:04,616 --> 01:58:08,183
interestingly enough, because no one really sequenced it.

1398
01:58:08,733 --> 01:58:12,616
Or by no one, I mean no individual person.

1399
01:58:12,750 --> 01:58:20,300
It was the endeavor of the collective or the spirit that possessed the collective over thousands of years.

1400
01:58:21,316 --> 01:58:24,533
But the narrative is coherent, which is really quite something.

1401
01:58:25,266 --> 01:58:27,350
And so the narrative is an investigation,

1402
01:58:28,033 --> 01:58:29,516
number one, into the nature of God,

1403
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:33,216
number two, into the nature of relationship with God,

1404
01:58:33,816 --> 01:58:39,400
and then number three, into the nature of the proper relationship with God, all of those things.

1405
01:58:39,950 --> 01:58:43,483
And God is the sum of all that's good.

1406
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:48,633
So the Bible is an analysis of the human relationship with the good.

1407
01:58:50,466 --> 01:59:00,433
What would have to happen after the publishing of We Who Wrestle With God for you to look back on that publication and consider it a success?

1408
01:59:01,116 --> 01:59:03,333
What is it that you want to happen?

1409
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:06,500
What do you want people to feel or to take away from that work?

1410
01:59:09,850 --> 01:59:12,500
I think we're at the beginning of the counter enlightenment.

1411
01:59:15,583 --> 01:59:19,966
The propositions, the enlightenment view of man is wrong.

1412
01:59:20,833 --> 01:59:28,033
And this, you know, out of the enlightenment view came science, but the science now indicates that the enlightenment view of man is wrong.

1413
01:59:28,633 --> 01:59:28,950
What do you mean?

1414
01:59:29,816 --> 01:59:33,966
Well, the enlightenment types believe that we could orient ourselves in the world,

1415
01:59:34,666 --> 01:59:36,316
let's say empirically, that,

1416
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:39,116
and this is Sam Harris's proposition,

1417
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:43,300
You can abide by the facts.

1418
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:48,350
You can orient yourself as a consequence of the dispassionate analysis of the facts.

1419
01:59:49,716 --> 01:59:51,400
You can't.

1420
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:57,366
And I would say the artificial intelligence engineers have figured that out.

1421
01:59:58,016 --> 02:00:00,366
The postmodern literary critics have figured that out.

1422
02:00:00,966 --> 02:00:05,350
The psychologists and physiologists of perception have figured it out.

1423
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:07,950
And the neuroscientists have figured that out.

1424
02:00:08,516 --> 02:00:16,783
So it's not just the evidence that that view is necessarily incorrect, is overwhelming and multidimensional.

1425
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:19,583
You can't orient yourself by the facts.

1426
02:00:19,950 --> 02:00:20,233
Why?

1427
02:00:20,733 --> 02:00:24,200
Because there are as many facts as there are things.

1428
02:00:25,116 --> 02:00:31,733
In fact, if you combine things, the nature of the combination is also a fact.

1429
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:35,133
So there's as many facts as there are things and combinations of things.

1430
02:00:35,516 --> 02:00:38,100
Well, you can't orient yourself by that.

1431
02:00:38,716 --> 02:00:40,466
That's, you drown in chaos.

1432
02:00:40,850 --> 02:00:45,050
It's like you're standing in the desert and there's an infinite number of directions you could go.

1433
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:47,266
Well, how do you choose a direction?

1434
02:00:47,666 --> 02:00:53,850
And that's showing up in that most recent survey that I just mentioned, people feeling meaninglessness, purposelessness,

1435
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:54,866
I'm overwhelmed by- Right, lost.

1436
02:00:54,866 --> 02:00:55,900
They're lost in the desert.

1437
02:00:56,416 --> 02:00:57,416
They're lost in the desert.

1438
02:00:58,533 --> 02:01:00,383
And the desert is the desert of facts.

1439
02:01:00,950 --> 02:01:02,000
It's dead facts.

1440
02:01:02,316 --> 02:01:07,350
Especially given.. how few people can agree on is this a fact or is this counterfact of the-

1441
02:01:07,833 --> 02:01:12,616
Well, that's also a problem, is that it's not like the facts are necessarily self-evident.

1442
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:15,866
Some facts are, and I suppose, to some degree,

1443
02:01:16,133 --> 02:01:25,066
what the scientific corpus is is the elaboration of a set of incontrovertible facts.

1444
02:01:26,166 --> 02:01:29,633
I've read recently that the whole Big Bang narrative is starting to come apart.

1445
02:01:30,050 --> 02:01:31,783
You know, that was a fact for a long time.

1446
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:33,266
Now, I don't know if that's the case.

1447
02:01:33,350 --> 02:01:44,133
I don't know enough about it, but my sense is that the new discoveries from the Webb telescope have made many of the presumptions upon which the Big Bang model was based questionable.

1448
02:01:44,933 --> 02:01:55,300
So now I don't wanna fall down a postmodern rabbit hole because although the issue of what constitutes a fact is a very complicated issue.

1449
02:01:55,833 --> 02:02:02,266
Anyways, you can cut to the chase by pointing out that we organize facts in a hierarchy of value.

1450
02:02:02,750 --> 02:02:06,250
And you see, the thing about, I'm trying to make this case in the book.

1451
02:02:08,633 --> 02:02:10,683
You do this when you look at the world.

1452
02:02:11,366 --> 02:02:14,400
You can't look at the world except through a hierarchy of value.

1453
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:20,966
So for example, as we're sitting here, there's an infinite number of places we could be pointing our eyes.

1454
02:02:21,450 --> 02:02:25,616
Like I could be talking to you and looking at this little spot on the concrete floor,

1455
02:02:26,016 --> 02:02:30,400
or the spot beside it, or the infinite number of spots surrounding it constantly.

1456
02:02:30,633 --> 02:02:32,200
But I'm not, I'm looking at your eyes.

1457
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:33,283
Okay, why?

1458
02:02:33,616 --> 02:02:35,083
Because I'm prioritizing them.

1459
02:02:35,716 --> 02:02:40,350
So the fact that dominates in this landscape is the fact of your eyes.

1460
02:02:40,816 --> 02:02:41,083
Why?

1461
02:02:43,550 --> 02:02:48,383
I can use your eyes to evaluate our shared focus, right?

1462
02:02:50,166 --> 02:02:51,950
And that's why we look at other people's eyes.

1463
02:02:52,300 --> 02:02:54,150
It's also why humans have got white around the outside.

1464
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:54,650
Exactly.

1465
02:02:55,016 --> 02:02:59,716
It's so that we can see what other people are attending to so that we can get insight into the story.

1466
02:03:00,816 --> 02:03:04,650
A story is a description of a hierarchy of value.

1467
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:06,933
Stories can be fantastical though, right?

1468
02:03:07,233 --> 02:03:08,866
If they're untethered to anything,

1469
02:03:09,233 --> 02:03:10,783
I can make a Harry Potter's a story.

1470
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:15,333
If they're untethered to anything, you won't find them interesting.

1471
02:03:15,433 --> 02:03:16,333
Because they won't resonate.

1472
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:18,433
They won't grip you.

1473
02:03:19,416 --> 02:03:20,433
Yeah, they're tethered.

1474
02:03:21,333 --> 02:03:26,083
Stories are tethered to reality in a very, very complicated way.

1475
02:03:27,450 --> 02:03:31,466
because reality isn't what presents itself moment to moment.

1476
02:03:31,483 --> 02:03:46,416
There's a huge debate among philosophers about mathematical abstractions.

1477
02:03:46,416 --> 02:03:47,416
Are they real?

1478
02:03:47,433 --> 02:03:52,550
Well, you could make a case that a mathematical abstraction is more real than the thing from which it's abstracted.

1479
02:03:52,550 --> 02:03:55,316
How would you make that case?

1480
02:03:55,316 --> 02:03:58,833
If you're a master of mathematics, you master the world.

1481
02:03:58,850 --> 02:04:06,683
So are the mathematical abstractions more or less real narrative abstractions are abstractions but you could say

1482
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:19,866
this is what an archetype is an archetype is a narrative abstraction that's more real than the world than the apparent world it's behind the scenes and the biblical corpus is a

1483
02:04:21,266 --> 02:04:30,266
is a narrative it's a hyper real narrative that's the right way to think about it it's more real than real it's more real than reality

1484
02:04:30,300 --> 02:04:32,700
how could something that isn't the thing be more real than the thing

1485
02:04:32,716 --> 02:04:41,316
well that's exactly the problem with abstraction right is the idea of a church more real than a given church

1486
02:04:41,350 --> 02:04:53,950
well it is in some ways because it encapsulates what's similar across all churches right so it it's like a platonic ideal a category is like a platonic ideal is it more or less real.

1487
02:04:53,983 --> 02:05:02,266
Well, you could say that the reality, this is what Plato said, the reality is a dim shadow of the essence.

1488
02:05:02,266 --> 02:05:05,333
The reality is less real than the ideal.

1489
02:05:05,416 --> 02:05:12,066
And that's actually in some ways built into our perception.

1490
02:05:12,083 --> 02:05:20,250
We criticize the things that present themselves to us because they are poor reflections of the hypothetical ideal.

1491
02:05:20,250 --> 02:05:21,733
You might say, well, the ideal isn't real.

1492
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:22,883
It's like well

1493
02:05:24,433 --> 02:05:25,883
You could make the all

1494
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:32,400
Opposite argument which is that the ideal is more real than the thing itself I mean, I can give you an example of these patterns.

1495
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:35,600
So in the story of Cain and Abel you have two patterns of sacrifice

1496
02:05:36,783 --> 02:05:36,983
Okay

1497
02:05:37,916 --> 02:05:39,533
Why is sacrifice an issue?

1498
02:05:40,900 --> 02:05:46,433
The reason it's an issue is because people exist in a sacrificial relationship to the world.

1499
02:05:46,433 --> 02:05:47,133
What does that mean?

1500
02:05:48,333 --> 02:05:53,333
it seems to mean something like human beings are aware of their extended self.

1501
02:05:53,550 --> 02:05:59,283
You know you're gonna be around tomorrow and next week and next month and next year and five years from now and 10 years from now.

1502
02:05:59,350 --> 02:06:06,100
Now it's less certain as you go out, but you do have the sense of yourself as something that stretches across the decades.

1503
02:06:06,966 --> 02:06:14,516
Okay, and so what that means is that you have to conduct yourself in a manner that isn't merely immediate.

1504
02:06:15,033 --> 02:06:18,483
You have to conduct yourself in a manner that will work across time.

1505
02:06:18,916 --> 02:06:20,066
Now, how do people do that?

1506
02:06:20,816 --> 02:06:21,350
They work.

1507
02:06:22,216 --> 02:06:24,066
Work is a sacrificial gesture.

1508
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:28,650
So you work by definition, virtually.

1509
02:06:29,633 --> 02:06:31,983
Work is the sacrifice of the present for the future.

1510
02:06:33,200 --> 02:06:37,116
I mean, maybe someone can come up with a better definition of work than that, but I don't think so.

1511
02:06:37,250 --> 02:06:40,400
It's like you put in time and effort right now.

1512
02:06:40,466 --> 02:06:45,550
It's something, even if it's something maybe not what you'd like to be doing at the moment,

1513
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:47,983
you put in time and effort because you believe,

1514
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:49,733
What the hell does that mean?

1515
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:51,600
You believe it'll pay off.

1516
02:06:52,533 --> 02:06:55,383
Well, is that a contract with the future?

1517
02:06:55,950 --> 02:06:56,800
Is it a covenant?

1518
02:06:57,500 --> 02:07:06,133
Because the relationship that the biblical corpus insists characterizes human striving is covenant.

1519
02:07:06,550 --> 02:07:07,233
It's a bargain.

1520
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:12,283
The bargain is you make the right sacrifices and they pay off.

1521
02:07:13,250 --> 02:07:14,000
That's the bargain.

1522
02:07:14,750 --> 02:07:20,783
Now you might say, well, that's just part of the social contract, But the biblical corpus insists that it's deeper than that.

1523
02:07:20,900 --> 02:07:22,883
It's built into the structure of reality itself.

1524
02:07:23,533 --> 02:07:25,983
And that if you got the sacrifices right,

1525
02:07:27,250 --> 02:07:28,833
the future would be paradisal.

1526
02:07:29,766 --> 02:07:33,533
I've got it in my head that Carl Jung quote, beware of unearned wisdom.

1527
02:07:34,750 --> 02:07:38,383
That feels like, that feels like it plays a role here.

1528
02:07:39,133 --> 02:07:48,883
Like how the work that you need to put in in order to be able to arrive at genuinely knowing the thing, the difference between actually being attractive

1529
02:07:48,916 --> 02:07:56,216
because who you are is attractive and you being able to be a pick-up artist that is able to make the mouth noises and the hand gestures that causes the thing to occur.

1530
02:07:56,250 --> 02:07:58,100
Those are the fruits of false sacrifice.

1531
02:07:58,166 --> 02:08:05,050
You could say that unearned moral reputation is the consequence of false sacrifice.

1532
02:08:05,533 --> 02:08:07,383
Well, this is performative empathy, right?

1533
02:08:07,450 --> 02:08:08,983
Sure, exactly, definitely.

1534
02:08:08,983 --> 02:08:09,400
On the internet.

1535
02:08:09,950 --> 02:08:12,400
Definitely, that's the same as praying in public.

1536
02:08:12,766 --> 02:08:13,866
Look at how good I am.

1537
02:08:14,733 --> 02:08:18,883
If the look at comes before the how good I am,

1538
02:08:19,466 --> 02:08:20,733
right, right, right, right.

1539
02:08:20,916 --> 02:08:23,983
It really wreaks havoc on the good claim.

1540
02:08:24,116 --> 02:08:26,166
But it's also, I spoke to Douglas about this,

1541
02:08:26,450 --> 02:08:30,083
it seems to almost be a predictor.

1542
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:33,966
It's an identifier that you should be a little bit more cautious about what this person's doing.

1543
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:34,483
Definitely.

1544
02:08:34,833 --> 02:08:39,916
You know, every single person that's super sweet tea and nicey, nicey, Lizzo.

1545
02:08:40,233 --> 02:08:41,866
Do you see Lizzo was in the news recently?

1546
02:08:42,416 --> 02:08:42,516
No.

1547
02:08:43,016 --> 02:08:46,033
She is a artist, singer.

1548
02:08:46,733 --> 02:08:50,900
She the one that got in trouble for abusing her close compatriots, yeah.

1549
02:08:50,933 --> 02:08:55,100
Dancers, yeah, she made her dancers eat bananas out of the vaginas of Amsterdamian strippers.

1550
02:08:56,500 --> 02:08:59,816
Douglas said that he- Oh yeah, that's a little on the hedonistic power mad side.

1551
02:09:00,166 --> 02:09:08,333
Well, she was supposed to be, you know, this Bassey, like for the girls and body positivity and all this stuff, but it turned out behind the scenes that she was treating her dancers terribly,

1552
02:09:08,383 --> 02:09:14,083
body shaming them all of the time, but she was the one up front that was the vanguard of this particular movement.

1553
02:09:14,150 --> 02:09:16,233
But you'd seen the same with, was it Jimmy Fallon?

1554
02:09:16,316 --> 02:09:21,883
I think he was caught up in a funeral recently that he was a tyrant to work for and yet out front.

1555
02:09:22,150 --> 02:09:24,016
Ellen Degeneres, again, the same.

1556
02:09:24,633 --> 02:09:28,216
It's almost actually like if somebody is

1557
02:09:29,333 --> 02:09:35,516
very much like that overloading on the sweetie, nicey, I am here for the underlings that you go,

1558
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,133
I'm a little bit suspicious of what's going on there.

1559
02:09:40,566 --> 02:09:45,816
If you need to proclaim your purity and your good standing,

1560
02:09:47,850 --> 02:09:50,316
if it's all words and opinions and not deeds.

1561
02:09:50,550 --> 02:09:54,850
One of the commandments, one of the 10 commandments is do not use God's name in vain.

1562
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:57,850
Okay, now people think that means don't swear.

1563
02:09:58,566 --> 02:09:59,716
And it sort of means that.

1564
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:02,083
That's one of its like tangential meanings.

1565
02:10:02,616 --> 02:10:10,833
But what it really means is do not claim divine motivation for self-serving behavior.

1566
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:14,050
Right, and that's performative compassion.

1567
02:10:14,650 --> 02:10:17,400
So what you do is you elevate compassion to the highest place.

1568
02:10:17,466 --> 02:10:24,150
So you make it your God, which is a big mistake because whatever God is, he is not merely compassion.

1569
02:10:24,533 --> 02:10:29,966
You elevate compassion to the highest place and then you say, I feel sorry for people.

1570
02:10:30,516 --> 02:10:34,533
And what that does is elevate your moral status to the highest possible place, right?

1571
02:10:34,633 --> 02:10:38,116
It's completely unearned because this is something J.K.

1572
02:10:38,450 --> 02:10:42,833
Rowling got so accurate with her Dolores Umbridge character, right?

1573
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,016
It was an absolute power.

1574
02:10:44,150 --> 02:10:46,216
Always in kink, had the cats.

1575
02:10:46,466 --> 02:10:47,833
Had the kittens on the plates.

1576
02:10:47,933 --> 02:10:49,850
It's like this toxic sentimentality.

1577
02:10:50,283 --> 02:10:51,050
I'm so nice.

1578
02:10:51,150 --> 02:10:55,633
It's like, yeah, I'd like to stay away from you and your devouring niceness.

1579
02:10:56,550 --> 02:11:06,533
The Freudians knew about that very, very, in a very sophisticated way, very early, because the devouring mother, the Oedipal mother, is the shadow side of compassion.

1580
02:11:06,916 --> 02:11:12,766
I've been trying to come up with a term for this for a while, I like memeing things into existence, giving them names, useful.

1581
02:11:13,866 --> 02:11:18,033
And at the moment, the best one I've got is the shallow pond of empathy,

1582
02:11:18,450 --> 02:11:26,683
which is, at the moment, something which appeases people and does not cause them any discomfort immediately,

1583
02:11:27,333 --> 02:11:32,383
is always prioritized, even if the net effect of that over the long term results in their suffering.

1584
02:11:32,616 --> 02:11:37,366
Absolutely, that's exactly what the Oedipal situation is.

1585
02:11:37,916 --> 02:11:45,483
It's the prioritization of short term emotional comfort over medium to long term thriving, right?

1586
02:11:45,566 --> 02:11:51,216
Because the mother who kicks the child out of the nest says, this is going to hurt now,

1587
02:11:51,933 --> 02:11:55,066
but the iterating consequences are positive.

1588
02:11:55,333 --> 02:11:56,233
Michelangelo's Pieda.

1589
02:11:57,033 --> 02:11:58,866
Right, exactly, that's right, that's right.

1590
02:11:58,916 --> 02:12:07,700
And that's exactly right, and the moral of that story is that if you give up your children to the world, you will keep them, right?

1591
02:12:07,816 --> 02:12:09,616
That's the sacrifice of Abraham.

1592
02:12:10,766 --> 02:12:17,733
Abraham is called upon by God to sacrifice his son, and he says yes, so he doesn't have to, right?

1593
02:12:17,833 --> 02:12:22,000
You have to offer up your children to be broken by the world, or you lose them.

1594
02:12:22,500 --> 02:12:24,366
You undermine them, you destroy them.

1595
02:12:25,483 --> 02:12:27,583
It's a very paradoxical truth.

1596
02:12:28,850 --> 02:12:33,733
we were talking about patterns Cain is the pattern of inappropriate sacrifice

1597
02:12:34,733 --> 02:12:42,966
he does everything second-rate he lies he omits he prevaricates he pretends he

1598
02:12:43,550 --> 02:12:51,483
doesn't offer his best Abel's the opposite he offers his best which means he's come his light is shining on the hill right

1599
02:12:51,516 --> 02:13:00,616
there's no hiding he's giving it everything he's got the covenant with God is that if you give it everything everything you've got, you will prevail.

1600
02:13:00,666 --> 02:13:02,033
And that's what God tells Cain.

1601
02:13:02,533 --> 02:13:11,366
Which to go through some of the threads from today, instinct, staying true to that instinct, honesty, saying what you mean, not prioritizing,

1602
02:13:12,016 --> 02:13:20,183
avoiding someone else's or your discomfort in the short term in order to believe that this is something which is going to make you feel better over the long term.

1603
02:13:21,233 --> 02:13:32,383
Well, that's a kind of sacrifice right there, is that you're willing to sacrifice your short term physiological and psychological comfort for a medium to long-term benefit.

1604
02:13:32,733 --> 02:13:35,300
It's the essence of sacrifice to offer the,

1605
02:13:36,100 --> 02:13:43,233
this is something the atheists don't understand about the biblical narrative, is that the narrative insists that we live in a sacrificial relationship.

1606
02:13:43,316 --> 02:13:46,733
It's the essence of humanity to live in a sacrificial relationship.

1607
02:13:47,116 --> 02:13:48,300
It's like, well, is that true or not?

1608
02:13:48,700 --> 02:13:54,816
Well, as you mature, your relationships are more sacrificial.

1609
02:13:55,066 --> 02:14:04,750
It's less about what you, in your narrow sense, want right now, and it's more about what's good over the medium to long run, including other people.

1610
02:14:05,233 --> 02:14:06,816
Well, that's a sacrificial relationship.

1611
02:14:06,950 --> 02:14:10,216
Now, the covenant, and this is a matter of faith.

1612
02:14:11,033 --> 02:14:12,433
It's the matter of the deepest faith.

1613
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:25,583
Are you willing to act out the proposition that the way to make the world reveal itself to you in its most positive guise is for you to adopt

1614
02:14:26,950 --> 02:14:29,216
the most appropriate sacrificial relationship.

1615
02:14:29,533 --> 02:14:30,666
Well, it's a big risk, isn't it?

1616
02:14:31,133 --> 02:14:32,483
Because you have to give up everything.

1617
02:14:32,916 --> 02:14:33,633
That's the deal.

1618
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:38,433
You give up everything that's low, everything, everything.

1619
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:50,200
Well, that's what the Christian passion is because the Christian passion is an archetypal story because Christ is the person who sacrifices everything thoroughly, 100%.

1620
02:14:52,366 --> 02:15:04,650
And the biblical notion is that there's no difference between that and the descent of the God of the Old Testament into the space of human reality.

1621
02:15:05,266 --> 02:15:10,166
So God is elaborated as a spirit in the Old Testament.

1622
02:15:10,266 --> 02:15:11,733
That's a way of thinking about it.

1623
02:15:12,250 --> 02:15:15,416
Fleshed out, right, into the law and the prophets.

1624
02:15:15,966 --> 02:15:18,633
And Christ presents himself as the embodiment of that.

1625
02:15:19,050 --> 02:15:20,950
So imagine, here's a way of thinking about it.

1626
02:15:22,050 --> 02:15:24,866
You can invite various spirits to possess you.

1627
02:15:26,050 --> 02:15:28,016
That's what you do when you give way to rage.

1628
02:15:28,633 --> 02:15:31,583
That's what you do when you give way to lust, let's say.

1629
02:15:32,700 --> 02:15:35,666
You allow spirits to possess you.

1630
02:15:36,900 --> 02:15:43,050
Well, what would you be like if you did nothing but allow the highest of spirits to possess you?

1631
02:15:43,650 --> 02:15:46,300
Well, that's the question that's put forth in the New Testament.

1632
02:15:46,783 --> 02:15:47,983
And part of the answer to that is,

1633
02:15:51,866 --> 02:15:57,366
If you allowed the highest of all possible spirits to possess you, you would be able to confront

1634
02:15:57,750 --> 02:16:00,183
everything that life could possibly throw at you,

1635
02:16:00,466 --> 02:16:14,166
and that's what happens in the Christian Passion, because the worst that life can throw at you is the worst tragedy, and the worst tragedy is the worst death, the worst and most painful death inflicted on the least deserving person, right?

1636
02:16:14,233 --> 02:16:18,033
That's the ultimate reach of tragedy, okay?

1637
02:16:18,116 --> 02:16:18,933
That's not enough.

1638
02:16:19,066 --> 02:16:22,600
Christ has to confront that and he has to confront malevolence.

1639
02:16:22,716 --> 02:16:23,866
That's the harrowing of hell.

1640
02:16:24,416 --> 02:16:27,033
So the idea is that to adapt fully to life,

1641
02:16:27,716 --> 02:16:37,300
you have to allow yourself to be possessed by the spirit that will enable you to voluntarily face unjust suffering and death and evil.

1642
02:16:38,233 --> 02:16:40,550
It's like, well, you got an argument against that?

1643
02:16:40,850 --> 02:16:42,300
How could it be any other way?

1644
02:16:43,566 --> 02:16:51,716
One of the things that I think I see people respond to this degree of pressure when they think about what is going to happen long-term.

1645
02:16:53,433 --> 02:16:57,516
I have discomfort that is in front of me now that I need to face, that I need to go through

1646
02:16:58,100 --> 02:17:01,300
if I'm going to get to something in the future that I think that I'm supposed to do.

1647
02:17:01,700 --> 02:17:05,566
And one of the solutions that they come up with, which isn't a solution, but it kind of is to them,

1648
02:17:06,116 --> 02:17:07,500
is I'm not gonna do anything.

1649
02:17:07,566 --> 02:17:07,750
Yeah.

1650
02:17:10,833 --> 02:17:14,233
No decision is kind of the same as a neutral choice.

1651
02:17:15,366 --> 02:17:22,150
One of my friends, Alex, has got this quote, which I love, and he says, the heaviest things in life aren't iron and gold, but unmade decisions.

1652
02:17:22,716 --> 02:17:27,000
The reason you are stressed is that you have decisions to make and you're not making them.

1653
02:17:27,766 --> 02:17:30,383
Yeah, yeah, that's, yeah, yeah.

1654
02:17:31,066 --> 02:17:31,700
No doubt about it.

1655
02:17:31,833 --> 02:17:35,833
Well, there's no indecision, right?

1656
02:17:35,916 --> 02:17:39,683
There's only, because you age.

1657
02:17:41,100 --> 02:17:44,866
Like you pay for your, you pay for your indecision.

1658
02:17:45,033 --> 02:17:47,983
It's a decision, it's a decision to avoid fundamentally.

1659
02:17:49,150 --> 02:17:59,100
You know, and part of the moral that's embedded in the story of Job and in the Christian Passion is that you can master what you'll face.

1660
02:18:01,033 --> 02:18:03,716
And maybe that's true, maybe that's true.

1661
02:18:03,916 --> 02:18:08,450
I mean, the clinical literature seems to indicate that it's true because one of the things you do

1662
02:18:09,166 --> 02:18:20,933
if you're a competent clinician is you look at what people are attempting to accomplish and and maybe that needs some retooling but let's assume that they have a

1663
02:18:22,133 --> 02:18:27,816
Goal in mind that would work right you've talked it through with them strategically.

1664
02:18:27,833 --> 02:18:34,566
They have a well laid-out vision okay, now they're laying out the vision and they encounter impediments that stop them

1665
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:43,100
and maybe they're impediments that make them afraid and Paralyze them and so then what you do is you to decompose the impediment,

1666
02:18:43,116 --> 02:18:51,933
just as we talked about earlier, until you find a way they can advance that constitutes a genuine advance that they'll actually do.

1667
02:18:52,066 --> 02:18:55,583
So what you do is you take the problem and you narrow it until they'll face it.

1668
02:18:56,766 --> 02:18:57,766
Okay, then they face it.

1669
02:18:58,200 --> 02:18:58,966
Then what happens?

1670
02:18:59,350 --> 02:19:00,350
They get more competent.

1671
02:19:01,050 --> 02:19:01,800
That's what happens.

1672
02:19:02,316 --> 02:19:04,566
And then they get better at facing all problems.

1673
02:19:05,016 --> 02:19:07,466
So they don't just learn how to deal with that specific problem.

1674
02:19:08,033 --> 02:19:11,650
They learn a lesson that generalizes across problems, they get braver.

1675
02:19:12,300 --> 02:19:22,350
When you use exposure therapy, people don't get less afraid, they get braver and that's way better because braver moves from situation to situation.

1676
02:19:22,700 --> 02:19:25,650
Okay, so the question is, here's the question.

1677
02:19:26,900 --> 02:19:31,766
If you faced everything that was put in front of you, who would you be?

1678
02:19:32,650 --> 02:19:35,433
Well, the answer, the biblical answer is you'd be a true son of God.

1679
02:19:35,900 --> 02:19:37,016
That's the biblical answer.

1680
02:19:37,700 --> 02:19:39,083
It's like, well, do you believe that?

1681
02:19:39,950 --> 02:19:41,750
Well, it depends on what you mean by believe.

1682
02:19:42,966 --> 02:19:47,650
Do you think that you, do you have a better bet than facing what's there?

1683
02:19:48,033 --> 02:19:50,900
Well, you just have to be sensible about it for a moment.

1684
02:19:50,950 --> 02:19:56,666
It's like, is your theory that you're going to adapt better using falsehood and avoidance?

1685
02:19:57,850 --> 02:19:59,333
Because that's the contrary theory.

1686
02:19:59,700 --> 02:20:08,033
You either face it and you do that predicated on the faith that something in you will respond if you do,

1687
02:20:08,966 --> 02:20:12,050
or you don't face it, that's it, those are the options.

1688
02:20:12,933 --> 02:20:14,916
If you don't face it, that's faith too.

1689
02:20:15,566 --> 02:20:21,750
That's faith in the notion that avoidance and deception will suffice.

1690
02:20:22,066 --> 02:20:24,516
I think that for a lot of people, it's born out of fear.

1691
02:20:25,533 --> 02:20:27,883
It's born out of being a people pleaser,

1692
02:20:28,833 --> 02:20:36,583
and not wanting to hurt other people around you, and not wanting to tell them things that they don't want to hear, or not doing or saying things that you know are going to upset the people that are around you.

1693
02:20:36,750 --> 02:20:37,916
Right, but in the short term again.

1694
02:20:38,266 --> 02:20:38,366
Yeah.

1695
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:40,050
In the short term again, you know,

1696
02:20:40,416 --> 02:20:41,966
if you look at a good mother,

1697
02:20:42,533 --> 02:20:44,316
a good mother upsets her kids a lot.

1698
02:20:44,816 --> 02:20:45,716
Quit doing that.

1699
02:20:46,433 --> 02:20:46,583
Why?

1700
02:20:47,383 --> 02:20:48,033
Well, why?

1701
02:20:48,033 --> 02:20:50,283
Why not just let your children do exactly what they want?

1702
02:20:50,366 --> 02:20:53,200
When the answer to that is, well, first of all, it terrifies them.

1703
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,883
Because kids actually want, they want walls.

1704
02:20:57,433 --> 02:21:00,150
They don't want to be in the desert doing anything they want.

1705
02:21:00,250 --> 02:21:04,100
They want a walled space in which they have the optimal amount of freedom.

1706
02:21:04,866 --> 02:21:13,250
So a person who truly loves someone else doesn't strive at all cost never to upset them.

1707
02:21:13,666 --> 02:21:16,266
That's the devouring mother.

1708
02:21:17,983 --> 02:21:22,266
If you love someone, well that's the biblical quote, you chastise them.

1709
02:21:22,333 --> 02:21:23,083
Well what does it mean?

1710
02:21:23,166 --> 02:21:30,833
It's like, look, if you love someone and they're doing something stupid and self-destructive and you can see it, it's incumbent on you to say,

1711
02:21:31,366 --> 02:21:37,150
you know, this is gonna upset you, but as far as I can tell, you're doing something stupid and self-destructive.

1712
02:21:37,700 --> 02:21:42,250
And then there's gonna be a tussle about that because they're gonna say, well, who are you to judge?

1713
02:21:42,416 --> 02:21:45,833
And that's a perfectly good question is what makes you think you're right?

1714
02:21:45,933 --> 02:21:47,916
And here's the reasons I'm doing this.

1715
02:21:48,033 --> 02:21:53,283
And you know, these are the terrible experiences that I've had that have led me to take this path.

1716
02:21:53,366 --> 02:21:55,316
And sometimes that can be really compelling.

1717
02:21:55,400 --> 02:22:04,216
You know, you meet people who are bitter and resentful and then they tell you about their life And you think, well, yeah, but then you meet people

1718
02:22:04,733 --> 02:22:08,300
who've had just as terrible a life, who aren't bitter and resentful, right?

1719
02:22:08,333 --> 02:22:09,133
And they're doing better.

1720
02:22:09,533 --> 02:22:15,716
And so even if it seems justifiable, maybe even if it is justifiable, it's not justifiable.

1721
02:22:16,166 --> 02:22:24,200
One of the most common situations I think that this people pleasing tendency would show up in is someone who maybe thinks that they should break up with a relationship

1722
02:22:24,233 --> 02:22:27,933
but doesn't do it and sticks about in order to protect their partner.

1723
02:22:28,016 --> 02:22:35,416
And I found a thread on Reddit that was five questions to ask yourself if you're unsure about your relationship.

1724
02:22:36,616 --> 02:22:40,533
If someone told you you're a lot like your partner, would this be a compliment to you?

1725
02:22:41,666 --> 02:22:44,300
Are you truly fulfilled or just less lonely?

1726
02:22:45,433 --> 02:22:51,050
Are you able to be unapologetically yourself or do you feel the need to show up differently to please your partner?

1727
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:58,383
Are you in love with who your partner is right now as a whole or are you only in love with their good side, their potential or the idea of them,

1728
02:22:59,250 --> 02:23:04,383
and would you want your future or imagined child to date someone like your partner?

1729
02:23:05,166 --> 02:23:08,416
And this thread was just filled with people having existential crises,

1730
02:23:08,950 --> 02:23:15,383
and it seemed to me to be a collection of people who had managed to believe that

1731
02:23:16,400 --> 02:23:21,666
continuing to manana manana, the short-term postponement of the discomfort

1732
02:23:22,533 --> 02:23:28,616
of the decision that they wanted to have around their partner was somehow the noble thing to do

1733
02:23:29,516 --> 02:23:34,466
or the good thing to do or the virtuous thing to do or the thing that ultimately would result in the best outcome,

1734
02:23:34,500 --> 02:23:39,600
even though they knew that if they spread it out long enough and then it's just hidden, we're just shoving under the rug.

1735
02:23:39,650 --> 02:23:41,866
So yeah, that list of five questions, I think.

1736
02:23:42,450 --> 02:23:47,516
Well, in most relationships, you can break up or you can have a thousand fights, you know?

1737
02:23:47,666 --> 02:23:50,233
And if you have a thousand fights, then you don't have to fight.

1738
02:23:52,016 --> 02:24:00,183
You make peace that way because you're different than your partner so there's things to work out there and you might think about that as a compromise

1739
02:24:00,216 --> 02:24:06,416
but it's not, it's that you're different than your partner and you have to find a game that you both want to play.

1740
02:24:06,500 --> 02:24:08,950
That's not a compromise, that's a solution.

1741
02:24:09,500 --> 02:24:19,166
It's like you bring your skills to the table and I bring my skills to the table and then we figure out some game we can play where we're both optimally utilized and it's a better game than we can play alone.

1742
02:24:19,366 --> 02:24:20,550
That's not a compromise.

1743
02:24:21,416 --> 02:24:30,283
Well, but getting to that's very difficult and people bring all sorts of baggage to a relationship and you have to, it's just like disciplining children, really.

1744
02:24:30,716 --> 02:24:31,500
It's the same thing.

1745
02:24:32,616 --> 02:24:35,566
Your children are, you note your children are annoying you.

1746
02:24:35,766 --> 02:24:36,450
You can note that.

1747
02:24:36,700 --> 02:24:38,183
Ah, I'm being annoyed by my child.

1748
02:24:38,316 --> 02:24:39,750
Okay, so what questions do you ask?

1749
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:42,783
Am I a tyrannical son of a bitch who's touchy?

1750
02:24:43,300 --> 02:24:45,566
Well, that's why you need your wife because you can go ask her.

1751
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,133
My kids are annoying me.

1752
02:24:47,216 --> 02:24:49,533
Am I a tyrannical son of a bitch who's touchy?

1753
02:24:49,950 --> 02:24:53,433
And she said, yeah, you probably need something to eat or you're a bit of a prick that way.

1754
02:24:53,516 --> 02:24:55,383
And you gotta listen because maybe it's you.

1755
02:24:55,766 --> 02:24:59,150
Or maybe she says, yeah, that goddamn child's been getting on my case too.

1756
02:24:59,516 --> 02:25:02,483
And then you ask each other, are we mutually tyrants?

1757
02:25:02,850 --> 02:25:05,583
It's like, no, that kid's annoying.

1758
02:25:06,150 --> 02:25:08,816
Okay, do we want him to be annoying?

1759
02:25:09,900 --> 02:25:12,883
Well, if you love your child, then the answer to that would be no.

1760
02:25:14,216 --> 02:25:16,550
Because if he's annoying you, he's gonna annoy other people.

1761
02:25:16,733 --> 02:25:18,583
He's gonna annoy his potential friends.

1762
02:25:18,633 --> 02:25:19,983
He's gonna annoy other adults.

1763
02:25:20,466 --> 02:25:23,933
He's gonna go through the world being annoying and everyone's gonna frown at him.

1764
02:25:24,366 --> 02:25:25,233
That's not helpful.

1765
02:25:25,800 --> 02:25:27,300
So then you could just fix it.

1766
02:25:27,950 --> 02:25:30,116
And that's gonna cause some short-term upset.

1767
02:25:30,650 --> 02:25:38,400
You know, maybe you have like a 13-month-old child who's very extroverted and disagreeable, who like rules the roost.

1768
02:25:38,616 --> 02:25:46,383
And every time the mother goes more than a foot away from her, she has a squawk fit because she's learned to control.

1769
02:25:47,316 --> 02:25:51,800
Maybe the mother was still tied up with infant care and can't put down a boundary.

1770
02:25:51,866 --> 02:25:57,150
And so now you have to do something about this emerging monster of a 14-month-old child.

1771
02:25:57,700 --> 02:26:00,933
And one of the things you do is, every time the child is bossy,

1772
02:26:01,533 --> 02:26:07,550
first of all, you note it, and you note that you're not very fond of yourself for being tyrannized by a 14-month-old.

1773
02:26:08,750 --> 02:26:11,400
That's a bit of a status hit, like it should be.

1774
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:14,116
So you have to notice, I'm annoyed by this child.

1775
02:26:14,650 --> 02:26:16,016
then I should do something about it.

1776
02:26:16,266 --> 02:26:18,650
Well, it's gonna cause short-term emotional distress.

1777
02:26:19,400 --> 02:26:21,750
The same thing occurs when you're dealing with your partner.

1778
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:23,583
It's like, you're annoying me.

1779
02:26:24,466 --> 02:26:26,700
Okay, now maybe that's me.

1780
02:26:27,566 --> 02:26:29,783
So I should bloody well, maybe we should have a talk about that.

1781
02:26:30,100 --> 02:26:30,983
You're annoying me.

1782
02:26:32,050 --> 02:26:33,433
Convince me that it's me.

1783
02:26:34,400 --> 02:26:36,166
And I should listen because maybe it's me.

1784
02:26:36,633 --> 02:26:39,766
And if I'm annoyed about you and I shouldn't be, I should fix that.

1785
02:26:40,133 --> 02:26:40,966
But maybe it's you.

1786
02:26:41,350 --> 02:26:43,916
So let's find out exactly what's going on.

1787
02:26:44,250 --> 02:26:50,933
You know, and that'll usually, man, that'll, there's just constant thrust and counter-thrust in a discussion like that.

1788
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:58,583
And usually, you know, the conversational circle around whatever the hell the issue is till you get to the bottom of it, and God only knows where that is.

1789
02:26:58,950 --> 02:27:00,433
But then maybe you can sort it out.

1790
02:27:01,100 --> 02:27:04,016
You know, and if you sort out enough of those things, you live in peace.

1791
02:27:04,733 --> 02:27:06,466
And that's something worth attaining.

1792
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:12,616
You know, and I've thought forever in my marriage, there's nothing too small to fight about.

1793
02:27:13,150 --> 02:27:17,383
Now, you know, I put in some rules that I used to have with my clients, too.

1794
02:27:17,516 --> 02:27:21,733
It's like, if someone bugs you, you should note that.

1795
02:27:23,050 --> 02:27:24,816
And you shouldn't do anything about it, probably.

1796
02:27:25,516 --> 02:27:30,966
If they bug you twice the same way, then you think, oh, okay, that's twice.

1797
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:33,450
But probably still you shouldn't do anything about it.

1798
02:27:33,516 --> 02:27:38,300
But if they bug you three times, then you can say, here's what you just did.

1799
02:27:38,766 --> 02:27:40,233
And they'll say, well, no, I didn't do that.

1800
02:27:40,600 --> 02:27:41,900
And then you say, yeah, you did.

1801
02:27:42,666 --> 02:27:45,616
and you did exactly the same thing in this other situation

1802
02:27:46,150 --> 02:27:48,766
and you did exactly the same thing in this other situation.

1803
02:27:48,850 --> 02:27:52,700
So don't be telling me you didn't do it because you did it three times and I watched.

1804
02:27:53,500 --> 02:27:55,533
Okay, now they come up with reasons they did it

1805
02:27:55,816 --> 02:27:58,916
and maybe some of them have to do with what a stupid son of a bitch you are

1806
02:27:59,366 --> 02:28:02,283
and you should listen because maybe they're right.

1807
02:28:02,750 --> 02:28:07,333
But that's at least the beginnings of the process by which you unravel the problems.

1808
02:28:08,050 --> 02:28:09,800
You want to figure out, well, we don't want to do this.

1809
02:28:11,016 --> 02:28:12,600
This isn't the way we wanna treat each other.

1810
02:28:13,516 --> 02:28:22,533
We wanna get to a place where, we wanna get to a place where our whole life is like the best moments of the best dates we ever had.

1811
02:28:24,316 --> 02:28:25,066
That's a good goal.

1812
02:28:25,766 --> 02:28:29,933
And that's attainable.

1813
02:28:30,300 --> 02:28:31,200
You gotta work, man.

1814
02:28:32,400 --> 02:28:39,966
There's a scene in Genesis, God throws Adam and Eve out of paradise.

1815
02:28:40,950 --> 02:28:43,783
because of their pride, their sin of pride.

1816
02:28:45,100 --> 02:28:51,800
They each have their own particular version of that sin, Eve's sin and Adam's, but they get thrown out of paradise anyways for pride.

1817
02:28:52,900 --> 02:28:58,816
And God puts cherubs at the gates of paradise and the cherubs, they're kind of these monstrous angels,

1818
02:28:59,333 --> 02:29:04,783
terrifying figures, and they hold swords that are on fire that turn every which way and burn.

1819
02:29:05,733 --> 02:29:08,066
And you might say, well, what does that mean?

1820
02:29:08,200 --> 02:29:12,650
And it means that, well, a sword is something that cuts away, right?

1821
02:29:12,866 --> 02:29:16,983
A sharp blade, and fire is something that burns.

1822
02:29:17,666 --> 02:29:20,483
And a sword that burns, burns and cuts away.

1823
02:29:20,866 --> 02:29:29,066
And a sword that burns and turns every which way is a burning sword from which nothing can escape.

1824
02:29:30,100 --> 02:29:33,016
Okay, now, you wanna walk into paradise.

1825
02:29:33,816 --> 02:29:37,566
Everything that isn't worthy in you has to be burned and cut away, right?

1826
02:29:37,750 --> 02:29:39,916
Well, that's what that conflict is in a relationship.

1827
02:29:40,633 --> 02:29:45,466
You know, it's like that's not suitable for paradise.

1828
02:29:45,950 --> 02:29:46,766
What does it have to do?

1829
02:29:47,366 --> 02:29:51,700
It has to be cast into the outer darkness where there will be gnashing of teeth, right?

1830
02:29:52,316 --> 02:29:58,266
It has to be cut away and destroyed and everything that isn't worthy has to go.

1831
02:29:58,816 --> 02:30:05,533
Well, the Michelangelo effect is all about you and your partner becoming the idealized version of each other, right?

1832
02:30:05,766 --> 02:30:14,200
you are going to do for me the things that I want within your parameters of control, that you want to be the best partner for me, and I want to do the same for you,

1833
02:30:14,500 --> 02:30:22,016
and we're both going to communicate to each other, and we're going to stand our ground where we have boundaries, and we're going to continue to compromise where we want to.

1834
02:30:22,016 --> 02:30:22,933
That's what love should do.

1835
02:30:23,033 --> 02:30:23,950
That's what love should do.

1836
02:30:24,116 --> 02:30:33,183
Like, if you love someone, if it's genuine love, you see their hidden soul.

1837
02:30:33,666 --> 02:30:34,950
That's a good way of thinking about it.

1838
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:39,150
You get a glimpse of the light that they could reveal to the world if they revealed it.

1839
02:30:39,316 --> 02:30:40,016
That's what you see.

1840
02:30:40,700 --> 02:30:46,683
And then to act in love is to encourage that to come forward and to discourage anything that gets in its way.

1841
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:52,783
That's why I love the Michelangelo effect I'd heard of and I'd been using it as- Okay, so why the Michelangelo effect?

1842
02:30:52,966 --> 02:30:53,483
This is why.

1843
02:30:54,033 --> 02:30:57,800
Michelangelo sees this huge, massive, unhewn block of marble.

1844
02:30:57,950 --> 02:30:59,100
Right, oh, I see, I see.

1845
02:30:59,400 --> 02:31:01,300
And inside of that, he is able to see David.

1846
02:31:02,366 --> 02:31:05,550
And over time, slowly he will chip away and he will chip away and he will chip away.

1847
02:31:06,233 --> 02:31:16,466
So you see something that isn't there that's inside of the thing, which is rough and unhewn and uncivilized and undomesticated and rambunctious and sometimes terrible.

1848
02:31:17,533 --> 02:31:19,166
And you were able to, from that, alchemize.

1849
02:31:19,233 --> 02:31:23,616
Yeah, yeah, that's actually part of the Tao Te Ching, the uncarved block.

1850
02:31:24,300 --> 02:31:27,933
So a child is an uncarved block in the Taoist view.

1851
02:31:28,750 --> 02:31:35,116
And you remove everything that's excess until what's perfect remains, right?

1852
02:31:35,216 --> 02:31:42,100
And that's, see, the logos in the Old and New Testament, the logos that creates the world,

1853
02:31:43,116 --> 02:31:52,083
is the judging faculty that, what would you say, that separates the wheat from the chaff, right?

1854
02:31:52,133 --> 02:32:00,450
And it's not, it's compassion in a sense, because if you're compassionate towards someone, you want what's best for them, all things considered.

1855
02:32:00,916 --> 02:32:09,366
But that compassion in the highest sense can't exist without judgment because the judgment is this part of you isn't worthy to continue.

1856
02:32:09,850 --> 02:32:11,583
And certainly that's what you're doing with your children.

1857
02:32:11,650 --> 02:32:17,500
When you see them misbehaving, you think, no, that's no, not that, not that.

1858
02:32:18,133 --> 02:32:19,400
Something more sophisticated.

1859
02:32:19,466 --> 02:32:24,583
Even with my little granddaughter the other day, she's very, very playful and she's a very nice little girl.

1860
02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:28,866
She's very playful and very fun and funny and not neurotic.

1861
02:32:29,683 --> 02:32:38,200
So she's a pleasure to be around but she hasn't seen me for a while And so she was poking me getting me to chase her around and poking me and she come up and give me a whack

1862
02:32:38,216 --> 02:32:44,616
and at one point she whacked me too hard and she knew it and I said, that's not fun

1863
02:32:44,666 --> 02:32:51,233
That's not acceptable and then she stopped but she was playing with that edge trying to find out where fun is and you know

1864
02:32:51,533 --> 02:32:53,216
Can how hard can I hit grandpa?

1865
02:32:53,216 --> 02:32:57,516
She does bloody well know she kind of knows but she needs to know exactly well, I

1866
02:32:58,416 --> 02:33:01,683
I can't let her get away with it because then she's not fun to play with.

1867
02:33:02,166 --> 02:33:08,733
She has to learn to come and give her grandpa a whack in exactly the way that elicits a playful response and that isn't annoying.

1868
02:33:09,150 --> 02:33:14,383
And so there's a very, you know, you might think, well, it's pretty harsh judgment to lay on a five-year-old.

1869
02:33:14,450 --> 02:33:15,266
It's like, no, it's not.

1870
02:33:15,433 --> 02:33:19,600
I would like her to be the most fun kid to play with that she could be, right?

1871
02:33:19,650 --> 02:33:22,116
And so I'm not gonna pretend that it's okay when it's not.

1872
02:33:22,350 --> 02:33:24,733
Not setting that boundary is almost like a curse.

1873
02:33:25,150 --> 02:33:25,750
It is a curse.

1874
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:27,050
Yeah, there you go away.

1875
02:33:27,266 --> 02:33:31,716
Yeah, because then how is she gonna play with other kids if she doesn't know the rules?

1876
02:33:31,833 --> 02:33:33,566
They're not gonna be as forgiving as grandpa.

1877
02:33:33,950 --> 02:33:34,733
Definitely not.

1878
02:33:35,400 --> 02:33:36,966
Yeah, we were talking before we got started.

1879
02:33:37,350 --> 02:33:42,216
I had this conversation with Robert Sapolsky and it was really, really profound.

1880
02:33:42,350 --> 02:33:49,133
I mean, I know that he's a brilliant guy and this new book of his is about sort of free will and determinism, which has got an upper bound on how interesting that is for me.

1881
02:33:49,800 --> 02:33:58,383
But he gave this quote to Andrew Huebman where he said, "'Dopamine is not about the pursuit of happiness, it is about the happiness of pursuit.

1882
02:33:58,850 --> 02:33:59,916
Right, that's definitely right.

1883
02:34:00,266 --> 02:34:02,983
And I haven't been able to stop seeing this everywhere.

1884
02:34:03,033 --> 02:34:07,216
So Morgan Housel, a friend told me this great story.

1885
02:34:08,150 --> 02:34:12,150
He is an investor, he's got a fund, he's an author, he's got a family, he's got all of these things.

1886
02:34:13,050 --> 02:34:14,166
They plan to go away on holiday.

1887
02:34:15,116 --> 02:34:22,500
They've been planning it for a long time and with the kids and the wife and him and all of his businesses, it was an arduous thing to go through to get themselves out there.

1888
02:34:23,316 --> 02:34:27,850
And finally, they get there after the journey and the plane and the children and the crying and all the rest of it.

1889
02:34:27,933 --> 02:34:31,766
And he walks out on the balcony on the first night of this holiday that they've planned for forever.

1890
02:34:32,433 --> 02:34:37,233
And his first thought to himself was, wouldn't it be great if we came back here next year?

1891
02:34:38,166 --> 02:34:40,483
It would be so great if we could come back here next year.

1892
02:34:40,533 --> 02:34:48,116
So literally during the supposed enjoyment of the destination, he was already thinking about the journey.

1893
02:34:48,700 --> 02:34:54,066
And it's not the destination, it's the journey is kind of trite, but it puts a new perspective on it.

1894
02:34:54,633 --> 02:34:55,816
There is no destination.

1895
02:34:55,950 --> 02:35:00,933
Each destination is simply the beginning of the next journey and I haven't not been able to see it.

1896
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:03,116
I see it everywhere.

1897
02:35:03,133 --> 02:35:04,266
I see it everywhere in my own life.

1898
02:35:04,266 --> 02:35:06,850
Well, there's technically two different forms of reward.

1899
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:09,100
There's consummatory reward.

1900
02:35:09,766 --> 02:35:10,916
And so that's the reward.

1901
02:35:11,333 --> 02:35:12,433
That's what an orgasm is.

1902
02:35:12,733 --> 02:35:13,916
It's consummatory reward.

1903
02:35:14,450 --> 02:35:19,216
It brings the behavioral and perceptual sequence to a halt.

1904
02:35:19,650 --> 02:35:20,666
It ends it, right?

1905
02:35:20,733 --> 02:35:22,000
At the climax, it ends it.

1906
02:35:22,300 --> 02:35:22,983
But then it's over.

1907
02:35:23,416 --> 02:35:25,466
That journey is over, right?

1908
02:35:26,150 --> 02:35:35,433
Then there's the dopaminergic reward that Sapolsky was talking about, and dopaminergic reward is evidence of advancement towards a goal, right?

1909
02:35:35,916 --> 02:35:37,983
Okay, so there's a corollary to that.

1910
02:35:39,766 --> 02:35:55,333
Well, how do you become optimally engaged because dopamine facilitates engagement and focus, which is why drugs like amphetamines can be used for kids who are attention deficit disordered.

1911
02:35:55,933 --> 02:35:59,300
You tap up the dopamine response, they lock on, right?

1912
02:35:59,666 --> 02:36:01,950
Okay, so they're locking on to a goal-directed pursuit.

1913
02:36:02,533 --> 02:36:08,483
The problem with amphetamines is that they can lock you on so hard you can't get out of the frame.

1914
02:36:08,866 --> 02:36:13,400
So like kids on amphetamines will obsess, for example, cleaning up their closet.

1915
02:36:13,500 --> 02:36:15,283
They can't switch to the next activity.

1916
02:36:15,733 --> 02:36:20,366
Okay, dopaminergic reward is reward that's accrued in relationship to a goal.

1917
02:36:20,950 --> 02:36:23,000
Okay, so what's an implication of that?

1918
02:36:23,516 --> 02:36:25,900
Well, pursue the highest possible goal.

1919
02:36:26,466 --> 02:36:26,950
Well, why?

1920
02:36:27,433 --> 02:36:30,283
Because the kick from advancement is higher.

1921
02:36:30,366 --> 02:36:31,900
Now, you have to balance that.

1922
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:35,416
It can't be, you have to advance, right?

1923
02:36:35,466 --> 02:36:37,250
Because imagine the reward's got two components.

1924
02:36:37,700 --> 02:36:40,566
Number one is you're moving towards something valuable.

1925
02:36:41,566 --> 02:36:44,833
Okay, so you want it to be as valuable as possible, okay?

1926
02:36:44,916 --> 02:36:49,033
But you have to be moving, so it can't be so valuable that it's out of your reach.

1927
02:36:49,033 --> 02:36:50,050
You're gonna walk to the moon.

1928
02:36:50,133 --> 02:36:53,216
I'm not going to be able to see every single increment that I make.

1929
02:36:53,366 --> 02:36:56,383
Yes, you want to get to the moon, that's right.

1930
02:36:56,450 --> 02:36:58,100
You can't walk there, so it's a bad plan.

1931
02:36:58,733 --> 02:37:02,316
You need something extremely valuable that you can move towards.

1932
02:37:02,866 --> 02:37:12,016
Okay, so part of the reason that you establish a relationship with God, let's say, is because that's what sets the upper bound to your vision.

1933
02:37:12,616 --> 02:37:15,433
It's like, I want things to be the best they could be.

1934
02:37:15,750 --> 02:37:16,850
That's a vision of paradise.

1935
02:37:17,333 --> 02:37:21,666
Well, that has to be fractionated into your proximal decisions,

1936
02:37:22,216 --> 02:37:28,783
but lurking behind that should be this continual movement towards, what would you say, a heaven that recedes as you approach it.

1937
02:37:29,416 --> 02:37:30,966
That's the proper vision of heaven.

1938
02:37:31,050 --> 02:37:36,883
A heaven is a place that's perfect and getting better, both at the same time.

1939
02:37:36,933 --> 02:37:42,766
That's what music shows you, because a great piece of music is perfect, but it's just getting better as it unfolds.

1940
02:37:43,700 --> 02:37:44,450
And you need that.

1941
02:37:44,733 --> 02:37:49,583
This is part of the problem with a static utopian vision, something Dostoevsky criticized.

1942
02:37:50,166 --> 02:37:53,500
If you gave people nothing but consummatory reward,

1943
02:37:54,050 --> 02:38:03,116
he famously says, so that they can do nothing but sit in tubs of hot water, eat cake, and busy themselves with the continuation of the species.

1944
02:38:03,766 --> 02:38:08,716
Human beings would break that all to hell in a moment, just so they have something interesting to do.

1945
02:38:09,033 --> 02:38:12,550
What was that quote that you said on Rogan years ago?

1946
02:38:14,300 --> 02:38:20,833
If we were to make the world sufficiently perfect, the only desired lack would be for the desire of lack itself?

1947
02:38:20,933 --> 02:38:21,200
What's that?

1948
02:38:21,800 --> 02:38:22,583
What is that?

1949
02:38:22,650 --> 02:38:23,416
Now that's Kierkegaard.

1950
02:38:23,433 --> 02:38:24,266
What's the proper, can you remember the proper?

1951
02:38:24,266 --> 02:38:34,900
Yeah, well Kierkegaard pointed out that if we, as we make the world easier and easier, so this is perhaps part of the problem with the material plenty that's at hand,

1952
02:38:35,433 --> 02:38:39,516
is that at some point, what becomes lacking is lack itself.

1953
02:38:39,816 --> 02:38:40,283
Yes, yes.

1954
02:38:40,650 --> 02:38:41,916
Right, yes, exactly, exactly.

1955
02:38:42,066 --> 02:38:48,333
It's optimal deprivation, you know, and if everything is delivered to you on a platter, It's like, what the hell are you even doing there?

1956
02:38:48,700 --> 02:38:50,366
This happens in the story of Abraham.

1957
02:38:51,966 --> 02:38:54,466
So Abraham, who's the father of nations, right?

1958
02:38:54,550 --> 02:38:55,850
So Abraham gets it right.

1959
02:38:57,100 --> 02:38:59,083
He has everything at the beginning of the story.

1960
02:39:00,250 --> 02:39:01,250
He has rich parents.

1961
02:39:03,216 --> 02:39:04,716
He's got nothing that he has to do.

1962
02:39:05,750 --> 02:39:07,800
He's like 70 when the story opens.

1963
02:39:08,200 --> 02:39:10,800
He's been taken care of hand and foot his whole life.

1964
02:39:11,800 --> 02:39:18,483
And the voice of God comes to him and says, I'm the god of your ancestors telling you get out of your zone of comfort

1965
02:39:19,116 --> 02:39:21,700
Get out into the world and Abraham's pretty old by this point

1966
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:26,733
But for whatever reason he decides that he's going to forego the comfort

1967
02:39:27,850 --> 02:39:37,383
For the adventure and then as Abraham progresses he makes the requisite sacrifices each becoming more difficult as he ascends

1968
02:39:37,416 --> 02:39:44,916
and he adopts this pattern of relationship with the god that calls him to adventure that literally makes him the father of nations

1969
02:39:44,950 --> 02:39:50,250
and so you can even think about that biologically if you want you might as well.

1970
02:39:50,300 --> 02:40:01,033
People like Dawkins think reproduction is sex and that's why he can talk for example about the selfish gene making itself manifest in sex.

1971
02:40:01,033 --> 02:40:04,000
Reproduction isn't sex.

1972
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:07,716
Sex is a necessary but insufficient a precondition for reproduction.

1973
02:40:08,733 --> 02:40:13,633
Abraham adopts a motive being, a sacrificial motive being,

1974
02:40:14,116 --> 02:40:17,400
that establishes the optimal environment for his sons,

1975
02:40:18,233 --> 02:40:22,950
who then establish the optimal environment for their sons, and their sons, and their sons.

1976
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:24,766
So you can imagine that what Abraham is doing,

1977
02:40:25,150 --> 02:40:34,500
this is what the story means, is he's adopting a motive behavior that works best all things considered across multiple generations.

1978
02:40:34,900 --> 02:40:36,633
and he sacrifices everything to that.

1979
02:40:37,033 --> 02:40:39,216
It's this incredibly expansive vision.

1980
02:40:39,633 --> 02:40:50,000
Given that we're in a world which is comfortable and we have created buildings in which there are heavy things that you pick up and put down in the same place

1981
02:40:50,333 --> 02:40:53,783
because it's simply so rare that you have to pick up heavy things, right?

1982
02:40:53,800 --> 02:40:54,300
Right, right.

1983
02:40:54,633 --> 02:40:55,100
The proliferation-

1984
02:40:55,450 --> 02:40:56,866
We have speed bumps on our roads for the same reason.

1985
02:40:56,966 --> 02:41:02,816
Proliferation of ice baths and sauna and even reading to some extent,

1986
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:07,033
reading difficult things, where should people go,

1987
02:41:07,533 --> 02:41:12,333
given that they are in a world which is more comfortable than ever before,

1988
02:41:13,333 --> 02:41:16,366
where should they go to encourage them to find difficult things?

1989
02:41:16,400 --> 02:41:16,700
Truth.

1990
02:41:19,516 --> 02:41:21,133
Truth is what's optimally difficult.

1991
02:41:22,333 --> 02:41:23,750
The truth is optimally difficult.

1992
02:41:24,766 --> 02:41:26,200
It's a really wonderful thing to know.

1993
02:41:26,933 --> 02:41:27,933
The truth is adventure.

1994
02:41:29,550 --> 02:41:33,416
There's no distinction, partly because

1995
02:41:33,883 --> 02:41:37,433
If you're going to just say what you believe to be true, you have to let go of the consequences.

1996
02:41:38,016 --> 02:41:39,216
You can't predict the consequences.

1997
02:41:40,233 --> 02:41:44,983
Well, there's no difference between not being able to predict the consequences and having an adventure.

1998
02:41:45,766 --> 02:41:47,400
They're the same thing, right?

1999
02:41:47,500 --> 02:41:49,883
Because if you knew the consequences, it wouldn't be an adventure.

2000
02:41:49,900 --> 02:41:53,533
It's not an adventure if the consequences are foregone.

2001
02:41:53,616 --> 02:41:56,750
The same as it's no sacrifice or courage if there's no risk.

2002
02:41:57,100 --> 02:41:58,500
Right, right, right.

2003
02:41:59,400 --> 02:42:00,400
It's exactly the same.

2004
02:42:01,333 --> 02:42:07,816
And so it's a wonderful thing to know that optimized adventure is to be had in the truth.

2005
02:42:08,800 --> 02:42:10,400
Think, in every given situation.

2006
02:42:11,116 --> 02:42:18,050
So Christ says in the Sermon on the Mount that to orient yourself properly, and it's often viewed as this hippie pan.

2007
02:42:18,616 --> 02:42:20,100
Take no thought of the moral.

2008
02:42:20,200 --> 02:42:21,683
The moral will take care of itself.

2009
02:42:22,116 --> 02:42:23,716
You know, God takes care of the sparrows.

2010
02:42:23,750 --> 02:42:24,933
He'll certainly take care of you.

2011
02:42:25,250 --> 02:42:27,133
It's like a hippie wet dream.

2012
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:31,566
It isn't what, that isn't the, that isn't the core of the message.

2013
02:42:32,066 --> 02:42:34,000
The core of the message is very straightforward.

2014
02:42:34,533 --> 02:42:38,550
Christ says, aim up to the highest thing you can possibly imagine.

2015
02:42:38,966 --> 02:42:40,816
So that's the relationship with God.

2016
02:42:41,250 --> 02:42:45,716
You put what's at the pinnacle properly at the pinnacle and you aim at that.

2017
02:42:46,650 --> 02:42:55,900
And then you concentrate that and it's that and treating other people like you would like to be treated yourself.

2018
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:57,183
That sets the moral frame.

2019
02:42:57,766 --> 02:43:01,700
Then you attend to the day and the cares of the day.

2020
02:43:02,133 --> 02:43:09,966
It's like once you've established the proper moral frame, you pay attention to the day and you live in truth and that moves you towards that destination.

2021
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:11,600
You have to have the orientation right.

2022
02:43:11,616 --> 02:43:12,500
You have to be aiming up.

2023
02:43:12,966 --> 02:43:16,633
But then it's just a matter of, what would you say?

2024
02:43:17,050 --> 02:43:18,133
Abiding by the truth.

2025
02:43:18,233 --> 02:43:21,150
That's the logos that sets people free and that's right.

2026
02:43:21,416 --> 02:43:22,833
Doing it properly, right?

2027
02:43:23,066 --> 02:43:28,916
There was one of the other rules that didn't make it into your book, nothing well done is insignificant.

2028
02:43:29,300 --> 02:43:30,816
Right, right, right, right.

2029
02:43:31,050 --> 02:43:32,166
Yeah, well, you accrue.

2030
02:43:32,516 --> 02:43:41,566
So Christ tells his followers in the gospels to store up treasure in heaven, not in the places that moss can eat and rust can destroy.

2031
02:43:42,133 --> 02:43:43,300
Well, what is meant by that?

2032
02:43:44,266 --> 02:43:54,866
Well, it's meant by the same, it means the same thing that you just pointed to, which is that if you run yourself through a disciplinary process, so you accomplish something.

2033
02:43:54,950 --> 02:43:57,916
Maybe it doesn't, you don't attain the goal you were aiming at,

2034
02:43:58,316 --> 02:44:02,000
but you accrue a new way of looking at the world in a set of skills.

2035
02:44:02,450 --> 02:44:06,883
Well, if you just keep doing that, you have multiple ways of looking at the world and more and more skill.

2036
02:44:07,266 --> 02:44:10,433
Well, that's your storehouse of treasure.

2037
02:44:10,750 --> 02:44:19,733
You know, the reason women use wealth as a proxy for attractiveness is because wealth is a proxy for competence.

2038
02:44:20,633 --> 02:44:23,700
It's not competence because you can be rich and useless.

2039
02:44:23,800 --> 02:44:26,650
Now, it's not that easy, but it can at least happen temporarily.

2040
02:44:27,216 --> 02:44:30,966
But women use markers of wealth to assess competence.

2041
02:44:31,400 --> 02:44:34,183
And the competence is the treasure, not the wealth.

2042
02:44:35,033 --> 02:44:38,950
Because if you're competent, you could be thrown into the desert and you'll make it bloom.

2043
02:44:39,333 --> 02:44:41,283
I've said this about people that go to the gym.

2044
02:44:41,600 --> 02:44:46,016
So from the outside, someone that goes to the gym and has got a good body or whatever, it's the body.

2045
02:44:46,050 --> 02:44:49,500
And this is what you get to touch during sex when you're intimate, right?

2046
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:59,983
But the story that someone who has a good body tells you about the sort of person that they are is much more important, I think, than the way that it manifests physically.

2047
02:45:00,066 --> 02:45:04,933
It's someone who is reliable, who is able to overcome hard things, who is self-disciplined.

2048
02:45:05,150 --> 02:45:13,016
Yeah, it's just this whole big long laundry list of things that they're able to deal with pain and discomfort, which is kind of sexy in a way.

2049
02:45:14,566 --> 02:45:20,300
Well, it's the perfect, it's the perfect materialist disciplinary strategy, right? because it's very concrete.

2050
02:45:20,733 --> 02:45:21,716
Well, you change your body.

2051
02:45:22,050 --> 02:45:23,900
It's like, is that a spiritual pursuit?

2052
02:45:24,033 --> 02:45:29,283
Well, it is insofar as it requires, you know, long-term discipline and sacrifice.

2053
02:45:29,816 --> 02:45:36,883
And you might hope, and I think this is likely the case, that, you know, you can get stuck in the bodily self-improvement niche

2054
02:45:38,416 --> 02:45:44,866
and focus on that too obsessively, but you can also use it as a stepping stone to discipline pursuit itself.

2055
02:45:44,966 --> 02:45:46,133
And lots of people do that.

2056
02:45:46,300 --> 02:45:51,566
I think I told you the last time that we chatted about the manopause, this thing that I'd come up with.

2057
02:45:51,616 --> 02:45:59,350
So I noticed toward the end of my 20s that lots of guys who had been training with a particular modality,

2058
02:45:59,366 --> 02:46:04,566
usually bodybuilding, usually exclusively for the way that they looked, realized as they approached their 30s

2059
02:46:04,566 --> 02:46:09,666
that they were getting out of breath, going up a set of stairs and that they maybe couldn't touch their toes and they looked fantastic.

2060
02:46:10,133 --> 02:46:14,383
But no, they just felt like they should maybe start to value different things.

2061
02:46:14,750 --> 02:46:22,483
And they then changed their training and they would go and do Brazilian jiu-jitsu, or yoga, or CrossFit, or some other form of whatever.

2062
02:46:23,116 --> 02:46:27,500
And that precipitated a change in everything else.

2063
02:46:27,666 --> 02:46:29,333
And I saw this in myself, right?

2064
02:46:29,500 --> 02:46:35,583
I get toward the end of my 20s, I've achieved success in many of the ways that society tells a young man that he should value success.

2065
02:46:35,966 --> 02:46:37,883
There was a discordance, something fell off.

2066
02:46:38,550 --> 02:46:48,433
And you then think, okay, well, maybe I need to assess whether or not the things that I've been told I should want are things that I actually want to want.

2067
02:46:49,316 --> 02:46:53,183
And very quickly you realize, I don't know, it feels like a quarter-life crisis.

2068
02:46:53,250 --> 02:46:54,666
I think so many men go through this.

2069
02:46:55,066 --> 02:47:01,600
They go, I either succeeded or didn't succeed at a game that I was told that I was supposed to value playing, and upon reflection,

2070
02:47:02,233 --> 02:47:04,783
I really don't care for it as much as I thought I did.

2071
02:47:05,416 --> 02:47:10,083
Maybe there was some elements, I was so proud of what I'd done with my business partners, I was so proud of the things that we'd achieved.

2072
02:47:10,800 --> 02:47:15,333
But then there was other stuff where I was like, why have I attached so much of my sense of self-worth into this and this and this?

2073
02:47:16,900 --> 02:47:19,600
Then you start you have to assess and huh?

2074
02:47:19,600 --> 02:47:24,166
So this is what happens in the story of Exodus when Moses and cut encounters the burning bush

2075
02:47:25,633 --> 02:47:29,416
So he's just going about his business as a shepherd and he's doing alright.

2076
02:47:29,433 --> 02:47:30,666
He's got two wives.

2077
02:47:30,666 --> 02:47:31,400
He likes his father-in-law

2078
02:47:31,800 --> 02:47:34,650
He's well regarded in this new country that he's in

2079
02:47:35,033 --> 02:47:42,450
He's left Egypt where there's a price on his head essentially for killing a Egyptian who was toward tormenting at one of the Hebrews

2080
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:47,683
Anyways, Moses is just going about his business as a shepherd, which was a very tough job in those days.

2081
02:47:48,266 --> 02:47:52,283
And this thing catches his eye, this glimmer, this gleam.

2082
02:47:52,666 --> 02:47:53,700
And he goes to investigate.

2083
02:47:53,800 --> 02:47:54,933
Okay, so what does that mean?

2084
02:47:55,216 --> 02:47:58,333
It means as you're progressing through life, something will capture your interest.

2085
02:47:58,766 --> 02:48:02,416
And in the story you just told, it's like somebody decides they're gonna start going to the gym.

2086
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:08,250
There's something about becoming physically fit that calls to them, right?

2087
02:48:08,300 --> 02:48:09,533
Which is an interesting thing, right?

2088
02:48:09,600 --> 02:48:10,483
Because it calls to them.

2089
02:48:11,100 --> 02:48:18,400
It's not even necessarily a decision they make, it's more like a possibility that makes itself manifest that's of interest.

2090
02:48:18,933 --> 02:48:20,250
So they decide to pursue it.

2091
02:48:20,333 --> 02:48:21,783
So they look into it more deeply.

2092
02:48:21,900 --> 02:48:26,333
Well, so Moses approaches the burning bush and he gets closer and closer, right?

2093
02:48:26,366 --> 02:48:29,683
And a bush is a symbol of life, right?

2094
02:48:30,033 --> 02:48:31,600
Like it's a tree, a tree of life.

2095
02:48:32,266 --> 02:48:39,250
And a tree of life that's on fire is being, that's the life, the tree, and becoming, that's the fire, the transformation.

2096
02:48:39,333 --> 02:48:42,700
So a burning bush is a symbol of being and becoming as such.

2097
02:48:43,150 --> 02:48:44,333
Now it's something that beckons.

2098
02:48:44,800 --> 02:48:48,250
Okay, so now you pursue your physical fitness because it's called to you.

2099
02:48:48,616 --> 02:48:51,100
And you concentrate more and more on it, you get more and more disciplined.

2100
02:48:51,150 --> 02:48:54,933
But as you get more and more disciplined, you start to transform, right?

2101
02:48:55,316 --> 02:48:56,983
And so your vision starts to change.

2102
02:48:57,100 --> 02:49:01,566
Now, what happens to Moses is that as he gets closer and closer to the burning bush,

2103
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,150
he starts to realize that he's on sacred ground.

2104
02:49:04,600 --> 02:49:05,566
So he's going deeper.

2105
02:49:05,966 --> 02:49:07,583
The investigation is taking him deeper.

2106
02:49:07,633 --> 02:49:10,600
So he takes off his shoes. and continues to approach.

2107
02:49:10,700 --> 02:49:12,750
He's still going down the same trail, right?

2108
02:49:12,833 --> 02:49:13,666
Pursuing this thing.

2109
02:49:14,033 --> 02:49:17,833
And then the voice of God itself speaks to him from the midst of the burning bush.

2110
02:49:18,350 --> 02:49:19,883
And that's what turns him into a leader.

2111
02:49:20,450 --> 02:49:21,966
And so what does the story mean?

2112
02:49:22,150 --> 02:49:26,833
It means that as you walk through life in your normal mode, things will call to you.

2113
02:49:27,916 --> 02:49:30,700
And if you pursue them, they will take you deep.

2114
02:49:30,816 --> 02:49:32,666
It doesn't really matter what it is that calls.

2115
02:49:33,050 --> 02:49:38,233
What matters is that you pursue it and you pursue it to the depths.

2116
02:49:38,666 --> 02:49:42,583
And as you pursue it to the depths, you will become transformed.

2117
02:49:42,650 --> 02:49:45,116
And if you do that without reservation,

2118
02:49:45,500 --> 02:49:51,550
that will turn you into the person who frees the slaves and opposes the tyrants.

2119
02:49:52,133 --> 02:49:53,300
And that is how it works.

2120
02:49:54,133 --> 02:49:54,933
That's the call.

2121
02:49:55,916 --> 02:50:00,266
And that can happen in any direction, virtually any direction.

2122
02:50:01,833 --> 02:50:05,900
You just have to pursue it with sufficient faith, right?

2123
02:50:07,566 --> 02:50:14,833
One of the things that's been, I guess, derogated a lot by pretty much everybody at the moment is university education.

2124
02:50:15,600 --> 02:50:23,466
And I had such an interesting time at university, almost exclusively outside of my education, right?

2125
02:50:23,566 --> 02:50:29,000
All of the good things that happened to me while I spent five years at Newcastle didn't include what I was taught.

2126
02:50:29,150 --> 02:50:30,700
It was never inside of the lecture theater.

2127
02:50:30,866 --> 02:50:32,316
It was everything I was doing outside of that.

2128
02:50:32,900 --> 02:50:40,016
And lots of my friends, it's very trendy on the internet to mock higher education as useless pieces of paper.

2129
02:50:40,900 --> 02:50:43,750
It's not, you don't need it in order to be able to be successful.

2130
02:50:43,833 --> 02:50:45,583
It's certainly the thing that I've ended up doing.

2131
02:50:45,633 --> 02:50:48,883
This podcast didn't require me to go to university, but maybe in some ways it did,

2132
02:50:49,516 --> 02:50:53,066
but also definitely from a qualification perspective, it didn't.

2133
02:50:53,900 --> 02:50:58,866
But I think I'm still relatively pro university experience.

2134
02:51:01,666 --> 02:51:05,533
And yeah, you've got Peterson Academy launching, which is your new thing.

2135
02:51:06,550 --> 02:51:18,600
I wondered how you thought, well, basically, are universities salvageable given that so much that's good about the university experience has almost nothing to do with the education side of it?

2136
02:51:21,350 --> 02:51:22,366
Are they salvageable?

2137
02:51:23,450 --> 02:51:24,533
Some are, I imagine.

2138
02:51:27,033 --> 02:51:29,350
Hillsdale does great.

2139
02:51:29,516 --> 02:51:30,333
What's that?

2140
02:51:30,350 --> 02:51:40,366
It's a conservative college in Northeastern US run by Larry Arnn, they have a 1% dropout rate, as opposed to the typical 50% dropout rate.

2141
02:51:42,116 --> 02:51:49,466
And they provide a classical, what used to be a liberal education, liberal arts education.

2142
02:51:50,466 --> 02:51:55,183
It's a more conservative enterprise, given how the Overton window has shifted.

2143
02:51:55,816 --> 02:52:00,750
But Larry's students concentrate on physical fitness.

2144
02:52:01,433 --> 02:52:06,816
His philosophy department tends to meet in the weight room, which is pretty interesting.

2145
02:52:07,216 --> 02:52:09,466
He has weight benches scattered all around the campus.

2146
02:52:09,633 --> 02:52:13,466
About a third of the students take music courses, so the place is very musical.

2147
02:52:15,016 --> 02:52:16,300
It's a very disciplined place.

2148
02:52:16,850 --> 02:52:19,083
The quality of education is extremely high.

2149
02:52:19,516 --> 02:52:24,016
So there are institutes that are holding to their mandate.

2150
02:52:25,266 --> 02:52:33,350
I think that's rare, and I think overall, the universities have become irretrievably corrupt, as far as I can tell.

2151
02:52:34,150 --> 02:52:44,866
And so we had hoped that we could provide something approximating an alternative, but you put your finger on one of the complexities in doing that.

2152
02:52:46,033 --> 02:52:54,766
It's easy to think that a university is the transmission of knowledge from experts to empty vessels, the students, let's say.

2153
02:52:54,916 --> 02:52:58,350
So it's lectures, tests, and accreditation.

2154
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:02,450
But that's not really what a university is.

2155
02:53:02,600 --> 02:53:03,566
It's an apprenticeship.

2156
02:53:04,150 --> 02:53:10,466
If you're fortunate when you go to university, you find a professor or two that you can work with who really teach you how to think.

2157
02:53:12,233 --> 02:53:18,416
They're usually, those professors are generally quite rare and you're fortunate if you do establish a relationship

2158
02:53:18,766 --> 02:53:24,383
like that, especially at a big university where the student to faculty ratio is absurdly high, like 200 to one.

2159
02:53:25,016 --> 02:53:26,316
I was in lecture theaters that were 300 to one.

2160
02:53:27,050 --> 02:53:27,583
Right, right.

2161
02:53:27,816 --> 02:53:29,666
I didn't get a relationship like that with any of my.

2162
02:53:30,616 --> 02:53:38,100
Right, right, and that's really not good because you need an apprenticeship relationship to become educated, fundamentally.

2163
02:53:39,500 --> 02:53:42,633
We started this, we're formulating Peterson Academy.

2164
02:53:43,333 --> 02:53:49,200
We're hoping that we can provide people with extremely high quality lectures.

2165
02:53:49,833 --> 02:53:56,366
I'm fortunate, as you are, to be able to reach out to people who are charismatic and well-educated

2166
02:53:56,900 --> 02:54:05,900
and we offer them a good financial deal and we treat them very well and they come down to Miami and they record a relatively short lecture series, eight hours,

2167
02:54:05,933 --> 02:54:19,533
and we're implementing state-of-the-art testing procedures and we're going to be giving out a certificate that you will have to earn to acquire.

2168
02:54:19,533 --> 02:54:31,416
And so we're hoping that the quality of our graduates will be such that the certificate will speak for itself as a marker for conscientiousness and educated expertise.

2169
02:54:31,950 --> 02:54:32,450
We'll see.

2170
02:54:33,233 --> 02:54:37,750
We're also building out the social side of it because as you pointed out,

2171
02:54:38,166 --> 02:54:43,516
a huge part of what happens to you when you go to university is social and socialization.

2172
02:54:44,850 --> 02:54:47,883
You get to make a whole new group of friends.

2173
02:54:48,550 --> 02:54:49,550
It's a big deal, right?

2174
02:54:49,566 --> 02:54:56,333
It's a huge, it's one of those times in your life where you can parcel off who you were and you can become something new.

2175
02:54:56,400 --> 02:55:05,816
Well, you remember every single summer, at least for me, maybe this is because I was chronically so unpopular in school, I would come back every summer imagining that I would be able to reinvent myself.

2176
02:55:05,966 --> 02:55:07,283
I'm gonna be the cool kid this year.

2177
02:55:07,300 --> 02:55:09,050
I'm gonna be the sporty kid this year or whatever, whatever.

2178
02:55:09,433 --> 02:55:14,700
But the big one is age 18 because you're not even in the same town.

2179
02:55:15,100 --> 02:55:15,866
No one even knows who you are.

2180
02:55:15,933 --> 02:55:17,916
No one even knows what to think about who you are.

2181
02:55:18,766 --> 02:55:28,283
And that for me was the big inflection point of me going from the child that I was to this sort of young adult that I was going to end up.

2182
02:55:28,366 --> 02:55:29,083
Right, right.

2183
02:55:29,200 --> 02:55:36,883
Well, if you're fortunate, you have a number of times where that happens in your life, where you can make a relatively clean break and you can invent yourself anew.

2184
02:55:37,816 --> 02:55:39,133
This is, just to interject there, like.

2185
02:55:39,133 --> 02:55:39,266
Yeah.

2186
02:55:41,116 --> 02:55:46,183
There's an idea called monk mode, which has kind of become a bit of a meme online, but I first read about this years ago

2187
02:55:46,816 --> 02:55:58,300
and it involves a extended period of isolation to work on yourself, to reflect on your flaws, to kind of do the inner work, to introspect.

2188
02:55:59,800 --> 02:56:07,400
It's usually tied in with meditation, with improving your diet, with improving your physical fitness, your mental fitness, all of these different things.

2189
02:56:08,116 --> 02:56:13,033
And that, I've almost seen it as if doing that

2190
02:56:14,666 --> 02:56:21,183
and focusing on yourself for a short space of time that's very, very, it's maybe a couple of months really, really focusing on you.

2191
02:56:21,250 --> 02:56:26,500
Still going about and doing your work and doing the rest of the things, but outside of that, just really, really trying to make yourself as good as possible.

2192
02:56:26,916 --> 02:56:33,600
Periodizing that, for me, was one of the most powerful inflections aside from the lifestyle change.

2193
02:56:34,650 --> 02:56:37,583
That's what confession is supposed to be, fundamentally.

2194
02:56:38,766 --> 02:56:42,033
I mean, when you take stock of yourself, you confess.

2195
02:56:43,350 --> 02:56:45,166
You confess to yourself.

2196
02:56:49,916 --> 02:56:52,033
You make your sins a reality.

2197
02:56:53,366 --> 02:56:57,733
you assess yourself for your insufficiency and you proclaim your insufficiencies

2198
02:56:58,333 --> 02:57:05,550
and that well then you can start working on them it's like it's painful here's all the things that i'm not

2199
02:57:05,583 --> 02:57:11,283
here's all the things that i'm not that i would like to be right that's painful self-examination

2200
02:57:11,300 --> 02:57:22,800
but the advantage is you get all your problems on the table and the advantage to that is that problem by problem, there's likely some hope.

2201
02:57:22,833 --> 02:57:30,200
Like for example, you said you were unpopular when you were a teenager, but that doesn't mean that you had to carry that forward into university, right?

2202
02:57:30,250 --> 02:57:33,566
There was a possibility that, so how did you get out of that?

2203
02:57:34,033 --> 02:57:34,616
What did you do?

2204
02:57:36,100 --> 02:57:41,133
The main reason I think was that I didn't really understand how to relate to other kids.

2205
02:57:41,633 --> 02:57:49,300
So I found myself obsessing over the way that other kids would wear their shirts or tie their ties or the sort of shoes that they would wear.

2206
02:57:49,566 --> 02:57:53,266
Right, so you were looking at external models or markers of belonging.

2207
02:57:53,283 --> 02:57:55,383
Yeah, and that's why they had friends and I didn't.

2208
02:57:55,750 --> 02:57:55,950
Right.

2209
02:57:56,500 --> 02:57:58,216
And I didn't realize that it was just,

2210
02:57:59,500 --> 02:58:05,300
I wasn't socially adept, I didn't understand how to relate to other kids very well.

2211
02:58:06,033 --> 02:58:09,900
And I think I just got to the stage, especially when I went to university,

2212
02:58:10,533 --> 02:58:19,950
that I'd spent enough time for me to have learned at least some rough-hewn social skills

2213
02:58:20,516 --> 02:58:28,166
and now finally was able to sort of cast off some of the presuppositions that had maybe been following me.

2214
02:58:29,016 --> 02:58:29,250
Because-

2215
02:58:29,800 --> 02:58:30,916
What were the opening points for you?

2216
02:58:31,100 --> 02:58:34,000
Like, do you remember the first friendship you made in university?

2217
02:58:34,533 --> 02:58:35,750
Oh yeah, the guys that I lived with.

2218
02:58:36,100 --> 02:58:36,250
So-

2219
02:58:36,833 --> 02:58:37,800
Okay, so these were roommates?

2220
02:58:37,916 --> 02:58:38,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2221
02:58:38,750 --> 02:58:39,533
Okay, so yeah, that's a good,

2222
02:58:39,816 --> 02:58:42,250
See, that's a thing that's hard to duplicate online, right?

2223
02:58:42,350 --> 02:58:48,566
Because having a group of roommates is a formative experience.

2224
02:58:48,600 --> 02:58:49,250
It was crazy for me.

2225
02:58:49,450 --> 02:58:54,300
I didn't know, because again, only child, two parents living in a small house.

2226
02:58:55,233 --> 02:58:58,533
I didn't know that you were supposed to knock on someone's bedroom door before you were to go in.

2227
02:58:59,033 --> 02:58:59,866
I'd never done that.

2228
02:59:00,233 --> 02:59:00,866
I'd spent 18 years,

2229
02:59:01,716 --> 02:59:03,650
I'd never had to knock on anybody's bedroom door.

2230
02:59:03,766 --> 02:59:06,016
It's like, mom and dad are down, like, who else is there?

2231
02:59:06,350 --> 02:59:10,433
I'm gonna knock on the dog's, like the kitchen door to see if the dogs mind me going into the kitchen.

2232
02:59:11,800 --> 02:59:16,816
And so many of those things, looking back on it now, it's just so ridiculous, not knowing that that was something that you were supposed to do.

2233
02:59:16,950 --> 02:59:20,783
Yeah, well, not knowing those elementary skills though, that can be a huge impediment.

2234
02:59:21,133 --> 02:59:28,483
I had people in my clinical practice, we spent hours practicing how to introduce them and to shake hands.

2235
02:59:29,316 --> 02:59:30,500
Because you want to be expert at that.

2236
02:59:31,650 --> 02:59:35,633
Because if you're not good at that at all, like if you're really bad at it, you're screwed.

2237
02:59:36,983 --> 02:59:38,350
You can't even tell someone your name.

2238
02:59:38,766 --> 02:59:40,033
And so how are you gonna make a friend then?

2239
02:59:41,150 --> 02:59:44,583
You announce yourself as incompetent with your first move.

2240
02:59:45,033 --> 02:59:48,300
And then if that happens to you 10 times, you're so terrified.

2241
02:59:48,333 --> 02:59:49,083
Disincentivize.

2242
02:59:49,400 --> 02:59:51,000
Oh God, terribly, terribly.

2243
02:59:51,366 --> 02:59:52,933
And so you should become expert at that.

2244
02:59:53,333 --> 02:59:57,466
That's something you can do with your kids is so they can become expert at introducing themselves.

2245
02:59:58,866 --> 03:00:01,150
Shake hands, do it with a bit of a firm grip.

2246
03:00:01,533 --> 03:00:03,866
Look at the other person, try smiling.

2247
03:00:04,616 --> 03:00:07,500
you know, match your tempo to the other person.

2248
03:00:08,916 --> 03:00:14,133
Another dynamic that I've been thinking about recently, I was at a retreat in LA a few months ago

2249
03:00:14,500 --> 03:00:19,716
and one of the guys that was there had said he'd stopped talking and writing on the internet

2250
03:00:20,433 --> 03:00:23,233
because he noticed that the story he was telling in public,

2251
03:00:24,250 --> 03:00:27,250
he began feeling the necessity to live up to in private.

2252
03:00:28,300 --> 03:00:41,466
And I think that whether you're a writer or just someone that's got 500 followers on your Instagram
and a Facebook from back in the day or whatever, there is an online persona that people put forward

2253
03:00:41,483 --> 03:00:47,983
that they then almost feel is more real than what they are, and then they try and reverse engineer themselves to fit this new, is this-

2254
03:00:48,016 --> 03:00:52,516
Well, that's the problem with writing essays that contain what your professor wants to hear.

2255
03:00:52,600 --> 03:00:54,816
So you can't do that without altering your soul.

2256
03:00:55,266 --> 03:00:55,983
You can't do that.

2257
03:00:56,400 --> 03:01:06,916
You cannot construct for yourself a false persona designed to extract resources from the world without that becoming part of you.

2258
03:01:08,866 --> 03:01:10,250
No one is that sophisticated.

2259
03:01:10,550 --> 03:01:12,633
No one can have two selves like that.

2260
03:01:13,200 --> 03:01:21,966
It's part of the reason why you have to be very careful about what you say and do, is that when you practice falsehood, you become false.

2261
03:01:24,600 --> 03:01:27,083
It's not like those are beliefs that are just in your head.

2262
03:01:27,500 --> 03:01:32,266
You rewire yourself so you start to literally see the world through the frame of your falsehoods.

2263
03:01:32,566 --> 03:01:34,100
That's a very bad plan.

2264
03:01:34,333 --> 03:01:37,650
I've heard you say, if you say things long enough, you're going to believe them.

2265
03:01:38,816 --> 03:01:40,950
You become them, it's even worse than believing them.

2266
03:01:41,133 --> 03:01:42,050
It's deeper than that.

2267
03:01:42,750 --> 03:01:46,666
They're built into you as unquestioned implicit axioms.

2268
03:01:46,900 --> 03:01:49,416
And as we said earlier on, this can go in either direction, right?

2269
03:01:49,500 --> 03:01:57,933
You can fake it until you make it one small step at a time, moving toward a vision which you know is positive and you continually reassess to ensure that you're not getting hijacked and going in the wrong direction.

2270
03:01:58,516 --> 03:01:58,750
Yes.

2271
03:02:01,783 --> 03:02:03,666
So look, in the Pinocchio movie,

2272
03:02:04,050 --> 03:02:06,516
which I've analyzed to death in the Disney Pinocchio movie.

2273
03:02:06,816 --> 03:02:07,983
You're Mr. Pinocchio, yeah.

2274
03:02:08,300 --> 03:02:08,450
Yes.

2275
03:02:09,116 --> 03:02:10,183
World's leading Pinocchio scholar.

2276
03:02:10,233 --> 03:02:12,166
So Pinocchio, exactly, exactly.

2277
03:02:13,766 --> 03:02:19,133
Pinocchio is trying to get rid of the strings that pull on him every which way,

2278
03:02:19,500 --> 03:02:22,650
that aren't under his control, and to become something genuine.

2279
03:02:23,316 --> 03:02:26,400
Okay, so he has three basic temptations.

2280
03:02:27,800 --> 03:02:32,133
One is to lie, right?

2281
03:02:32,233 --> 03:02:33,016
So that's the nos.

2282
03:02:35,333 --> 03:02:36,500
Another is to be an actor.

2283
03:02:37,216 --> 03:02:40,516
And when I first came across that in the movie, I thought, what the hell is going on here?

2284
03:02:41,133 --> 03:02:43,516
One of Pinocchio's temptations is to be an actor.

2285
03:02:43,566 --> 03:02:45,533
Now, why would the Hollywood people do that?

2286
03:02:45,633 --> 03:02:47,083
Why would they denigrate the actor?

2287
03:02:47,133 --> 03:02:48,566
And then I thought, oh, it's not an actor.

2288
03:02:48,633 --> 03:02:49,700
It's a false persona.

2289
03:02:50,266 --> 03:02:52,300
To be the actor instead of the real thing.

2290
03:02:52,733 --> 03:02:54,850
To be the appearance instead of the reality.

2291
03:02:54,950 --> 03:02:57,766
to take the credit instead of doing the work, right?

2292
03:02:57,833 --> 03:02:58,516
To be false.

2293
03:02:59,700 --> 03:03:01,566
Next temptation is to be neurotic.

2294
03:03:02,066 --> 03:03:09,216
It's so interesting, especially in the world that we have now, how perspicacious these animators were.

2295
03:03:09,916 --> 03:03:14,200
Pinocchio is literally enticed onto the island of pleasure

2296
03:03:14,800 --> 03:03:18,733
by a false doctor who diagnoses him with an illness he doesn't have.

2297
03:03:19,866 --> 03:03:22,950
And the story is, look how sick you are.

2298
03:03:23,766 --> 03:03:26,650
You're working too hard, you need to go to Pleasure Island.

2299
03:03:26,766 --> 03:03:29,933
Well, Pleasure Island is run by slavers, right?

2300
03:03:30,700 --> 03:03:31,483
So it's perfect.

2301
03:03:33,550 --> 03:03:36,983
Well, be careful what you practice.

2302
03:03:37,800 --> 03:03:39,333
Be careful what you practice, right?

2303
03:03:40,100 --> 03:03:44,233
You can be the actor of your own ideal, and that's a way of stepping forward.

2304
03:03:44,366 --> 03:03:51,500
But when you make false claims to who you are, to gain status in consequence,

2305
03:03:52,916 --> 03:03:54,250
you're perverting your soul.

2306
03:03:55,100 --> 03:03:55,866
What's the soul?

2307
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:02,066
The soul is something like the structure through which the world reveals itself to you.

2308
03:04:02,550 --> 03:04:03,500
It's something like that.

2309
03:04:04,200 --> 03:04:05,650
So you don't see much of the world, right?

2310
03:04:05,716 --> 03:04:07,283
You see it through narrow apertures.

2311
03:04:07,733 --> 03:04:09,250
You see what you allow in.

2312
03:04:09,400 --> 03:04:10,850
That's another way of thinking about it.

2313
03:04:11,550 --> 03:04:15,216
You better make sure it's the bright part of the world revealing itself to you.

2314
03:04:16,133 --> 03:04:18,066
And that isn't gonna be the case if you lie.

2315
03:04:19,366 --> 03:04:27,050
One of the problems, I think, that a lot of the people listening to this podcast and certainly a lot of my friends who are smart and cerebral encounter,

2316
03:04:28,516 --> 03:04:32,300
they think themselves into problems and they struggle to use their intuition

2317
03:04:32,916 --> 03:04:37,500
because they are able to come up with a reason about why they should or should not at any moment.

2318
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:45,766
You know, talking about the soul or the inner voice or the conscience or, you know, you might refer to it as God that's coming through, the best version of yourself.

2319
03:04:47,600 --> 03:04:54,766
People that ruminate and introspect are very capable of talking themselves into or out of something that feels like their instinct.

2320
03:04:54,766 --> 03:04:56,150
It's because they worship the intellect.

2321
03:04:57,566 --> 03:05:06,166
How would you advise somebody who enjoys thinking about things deeply to cast that off and be able to hear themselves a little bit more clearly?

2322
03:05:07,233 --> 03:05:09,800
There's a difference between attention and intellect.

2323
03:05:13,116 --> 03:05:15,816
There's something to be said for paying attention.

2324
03:05:16,700 --> 03:05:17,633
It's not the same thing.

2325
03:05:17,700 --> 03:05:26,566
Like the intellect, let's say the intellect produces thoughts, the attention gathers information, right?

2326
03:05:26,633 --> 03:05:27,400
So if I'm,

2327
03:05:30,500 --> 03:05:32,933
well, if I'm conducting a podcast, let's say,

2328
03:05:33,833 --> 03:05:36,200
I'm paying attention to what I don't understand.

2329
03:05:37,416 --> 03:05:40,033
I'm not thinking, it's not the same thing.

2330
03:05:40,350 --> 03:05:49,416
I mean, sometimes I think because the person will say something and it'll set off a train of thoughts, but often what I'm just doing is like, Well, do I understand what you just said?

2331
03:05:50,050 --> 03:05:51,000
That's a matter of attention.

2332
03:05:51,100 --> 03:05:52,550
I have to note my ignorance.

2333
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:54,266
I'm attending to my ignorance.

2334
03:05:54,666 --> 03:05:56,700
Well, this is what, Rogan's great at this.

2335
03:05:56,766 --> 03:05:57,750
You're great at this as well.

2336
03:05:58,333 --> 03:06:00,766
If you attend to your ignorance, then you know what to do.

2337
03:06:01,216 --> 03:06:02,466
You just ask the question.

2338
03:06:02,650 --> 03:06:04,000
It's like, well, I don't understand this.

2339
03:06:04,750 --> 03:06:07,366
That's a form of humility to attend to your ignorance.

2340
03:06:07,450 --> 03:06:11,733
That's a good thing for those who worship the Luciferian intellect to do,

2341
03:06:12,216 --> 03:06:13,700
is to attend to their own ignorance.

2342
03:06:14,233 --> 03:06:15,300
It's not about what you know.

2343
03:06:16,166 --> 03:06:17,250
It's about what you don't know.

2344
03:06:17,850 --> 03:06:18,966
You already know what you know.

2345
03:06:20,216 --> 03:06:22,116
So why not investigate what you don't know?

2346
03:06:22,750 --> 03:06:23,533
Well, how do you do that?

2347
03:06:23,850 --> 03:06:25,016
You attend to your ignorance.

2348
03:06:26,116 --> 03:06:28,283
What's the definition of humility?

2349
03:06:28,716 --> 03:06:30,483
Humility is attending to your ignorance.

2350
03:06:31,350 --> 03:06:32,700
And you can do that wherever you are.

2351
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:36,066
Is that not still an intellectual exercise?

2352
03:06:36,466 --> 03:06:41,633
Here are the holes in what I know, therefore I'm just going to continue to ask the questions until I fill them?

2353
03:06:43,566 --> 03:06:54,383
Well, it's not something completely divorced from, it's the difference between questioning and answering.

2354
03:06:56,550 --> 03:07:00,016
Like, I would say, this is, let's say, definitional.

2355
03:07:00,350 --> 03:07:02,900
The Luciferian intellect has an answer.

2356
03:07:03,033 --> 03:07:05,316
What's, when you say Luciferian intellect, what's that?

2357
03:07:06,233 --> 03:07:10,200
The Luciferian intellect is the intellect that wants to place itself in the highest position.

2358
03:07:11,416 --> 03:07:17,600
And there's lots of people, smart people, tend to be Luciferian because they think that their fundamental value is their intelligence.

2359
03:07:18,166 --> 03:07:20,600
And they think that intelligence is the fundamental value.

2360
03:07:20,950 --> 03:07:23,900
And then they're often very annoyed if they're very bright

2361
03:07:24,350 --> 03:07:29,716
and the world doesn't lay itself out at their feet because they think, well I'm so smart, everything should just be coming my way.

2362
03:07:30,666 --> 03:07:36,700
Because they've prided themself on that, and intellectual pride, well that might be the cardinal sin.

2363
03:07:37,416 --> 03:07:41,400
The Luciferian intellect is the intellect that wants to put itself in the highest position.

2364
03:07:41,500 --> 03:07:50,583
It challenges God, that's what Satan is, that's what Lucifer is, literally in the Miltonian story is Lucifer is the spirit who attempts to usurp God.

2365
03:07:51,200 --> 03:07:52,616
That's what the communists did.

2366
03:07:52,833 --> 03:07:54,166
That's what the fascists did.

2367
03:07:54,250 --> 03:07:56,283
That's what we do when we build towers of Babel.

2368
03:07:57,166 --> 03:08:01,700
And we can easily elevate the intellect to the highest possible place, especially smart people.

2369
03:08:01,750 --> 03:08:02,666
They do that all the time.

2370
03:08:03,366 --> 03:08:05,733
It's better to attend to what you don't know.

2371
03:08:06,216 --> 03:08:10,466
This is why Rogan's a very good example of this because Rogan is not an intellectual.

2372
03:08:12,116 --> 03:08:13,133
He's a seeker.

2373
03:08:14,216 --> 03:08:15,300
Those aren't the same thing.

2374
03:08:16,133 --> 03:08:19,083
Rogan is always like a bloodhound.

2375
03:08:19,150 --> 03:08:20,716
He's on the path of what he doesn't know.

2376
03:08:21,433 --> 03:08:23,583
And the consequence of that is he knows a lot.

2377
03:08:24,016 --> 03:08:25,916
You know, 2,000 podcasts, 2,500 podcasts,

2378
03:08:27,100 --> 03:08:31,833
he's done like 2,500 high-level graduate seminars, something like that.

2379
03:08:32,166 --> 03:08:32,733
It's crazy.

2380
03:08:33,550 --> 03:08:36,500
And so his questions get better and better as he fills in the gaps.

2381
03:08:36,933 --> 03:08:37,783
Is it intellectual?

2382
03:08:41,966 --> 03:08:43,133
No, no, it's not.

2383
03:08:48,300 --> 03:08:55,866
There's a difference between an intellectual pursuit and a spiritual pursuit, and the remediation of your own ignorance is a spiritual pursuit.

2384
03:08:56,316 --> 03:08:57,783
It's predicated on humility.

2385
03:08:58,433 --> 03:08:59,416
How am I stupid?

2386
03:09:00,150 --> 03:09:01,133
How can I fix that?

2387
03:09:02,400 --> 03:09:07,033
One of the things I really taught my kids, tried to teach them, was ask stupid questions.

2388
03:09:08,916 --> 03:09:14,350
And that means you have to admit to your own insufficiency, that's what humility is, and then you have to publicly announce it.

2389
03:09:15,116 --> 03:09:17,100
is how I'm stupid, can you fix me?

2390
03:09:17,200 --> 03:09:21,033
And you know, sometimes that is embarrassing, although much less frequently than people think.

2391
03:09:21,950 --> 03:09:28,800
Usually, if you're in a crowd and you have a stupid question and you've been paying attention, 80% of the crowd has the same question.

2392
03:09:29,716 --> 03:09:31,033
And they're relieved that you asked it.

2393
03:09:32,416 --> 03:09:33,900
In fact, they'll think you're brave.

2394
03:09:34,666 --> 03:09:36,583
It's so interesting, eh, because you're afraid.

2395
03:09:37,050 --> 03:09:44,966
When you ask a question, if you're in a university seminar, you're afraid that what you're gonna do is expose your stupidity and be, what would you say,

2396
03:09:45,316 --> 03:09:51,250
And what happens is exactly the opposite, is everybody who's too cowardly to ask that question now thinks that you're courageous.

2397
03:09:51,533 --> 03:09:53,300
It's exactly the opposite of what you think.

2398
03:09:54,500 --> 03:09:55,816
Yeah, that happens all the time.

2399
03:09:56,816 --> 03:10:06,650
Always in my graduate seminars, the kids that asked the most ignorant questions, assuming they were paying attention, because you can ask a stupid question, you know.

2400
03:10:07,033 --> 03:10:16,216
Stupid question is, you're, I don't know, you're fiddling with your phone and the class has just covered something and you didn't notice and you ask, well, you know,

2401
03:10:16,550 --> 03:10:20,533
clue in, that's not a real question, that's just, you're just wasting people's time.

2402
03:10:20,616 --> 03:10:23,650
But if you're genuinely ignorant,

2403
03:10:24,800 --> 03:10:30,450
I never had a student who asked a genuine question that I thought was a stupid question, never.

2404
03:10:30,750 --> 03:10:32,400
And I'd never treat a student that way.

2405
03:10:32,800 --> 03:10:33,950
It's like, no, no, if you're,

2406
03:10:35,350 --> 03:10:42,283
if you, it's so cool too, because sometimes the stupidest questions cut to the heart of the chase.

2407
03:10:42,816 --> 03:10:45,666
You know, it's the kids who would ask a really basic question

2408
03:10:48,666 --> 03:10:51,950
that also forced me to really understand what I was teaching.

2409
03:10:55,150 --> 03:10:57,100
And that's a reflection of their humility.

2410
03:10:57,600 --> 03:11:02,433
It's that humility in the pursuit of, humility in the pursuit of the ideal.

2411
03:11:02,500 --> 03:11:04,133
That's not an intellectual exercise.

2412
03:11:05,400 --> 03:11:06,666
Not in the strict sense.

2413
03:11:07,850 --> 03:11:09,966
It's definitely what generates knowledge though.

2414
03:11:10,466 --> 03:11:13,100
That seems to be a good stepping block toward earned wisdom as well.

2415
03:11:13,566 --> 03:11:14,766
That's earned wisdom, yeah.

2416
03:11:15,600 --> 03:11:18,316
Yeah, earned wisdom through humility, right.

2417
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:19,950
What have you got coming up next?

2418
03:11:20,150 --> 03:11:21,800
What can people expect from you over the next few months?

2419
03:11:22,700 --> 03:11:28,350
Well, what I'm working on right now is I'm gonna finish this book, hopefully by the end of December.

2420
03:11:28,450 --> 03:11:34,333
It'll be published in November, but I'm gonna go on tour, weirdly enough, about the book, probably starting in January.

2421
03:11:34,366 --> 03:11:40,483
I'm gonna do an American tour, and then I think I'm gonna go to Africa and to South America and to Southeast Asia.

2422
03:11:40,950 --> 03:11:41,683
That's the plan.

2423
03:11:42,900 --> 03:11:46,150
And I'm very excited about this new book.

2424
03:11:46,933 --> 03:11:49,016
I'm hoping it'll be the best book that I've ever written.

2425
03:11:51,250 --> 03:11:57,466
It's gonna be more difficult book than the last two were, but not as difficult as Maps of Meaning, which was my first book.

2426
03:11:57,466 --> 03:11:58,300
Do you mean to consume?

2427
03:11:58,316 --> 03:11:59,650
Yeah, it's more, it's heavy, it's deeper.

2428
03:12:04,333 --> 03:12:06,466
Have you been fighting with trying to make it accessible?

2429
03:12:06,566 --> 03:12:07,916
No, not really.

2430
03:12:08,900 --> 03:12:15,350
I've been just trying to lay the argument out as clearly as I can, and I think that'll do the trick.

2431
03:12:15,500 --> 03:12:25,233
And I have to go over it again and edit it and make sure that it's no more obscure than is absolutely necessary.

2432
03:12:25,300 --> 03:12:28,216
No, I wanna lay it out so that it's comprehensible.

2433
03:12:28,250 --> 03:12:33,533
And I've had a lot of success with the biblical ventures that I've already embarked on.

2434
03:12:34,100 --> 03:12:43,800
I did a series on Genesis in 2017, which turned out to be quite influential and then I just did a seminar on Exodus with a group of thinkers

2435
03:12:43,816 --> 03:12:59,316
and I know there's a hunger for analysis of deep stories and I also have good people around me that can help me grind my way through the stories and understand them

2436
03:12:59,333 --> 03:13:06,933
and so I'm very much looking I've been having quite a good time writing this book actually it's very difficult to right, but it's been extremely exciting and

2437
03:13:07,033 --> 03:13:13,483
interesting and I'm hoping, you asked me earlier, what would I consider success with this book?

2438
03:13:16,016 --> 03:13:19,850
I don't think that you'll be able to read this book and understand it and be atheistic.

2439
03:13:21,816 --> 03:13:25,050
I think I can demolish the atheistic argument permanently.

2440
03:13:26,966 --> 03:13:32,783
And it's partly, it's a weird thing because it's not like all of a sudden people are going to throw themselves at the feet of God in worship

2441
03:13:32,816 --> 03:13:41,916
it's like it requires a reconsideration of what we mean by belief and I walked through some of it it's like do you believe in the good

2442
03:13:41,983 --> 03:13:47,666
well they're the difference between believing in good and believing in God

2443
03:13:48,050 --> 03:13:54,583
is it's it's a very narrow difference now there are important differences but

2444
03:13:55,250 --> 03:14:01,100
it's still a narrow difference and the thing is if you don't believe in in good you're aimless.

2445
03:14:01,250 --> 03:14:02,483
And if you're aimless, you're hopeless.

2446
03:14:02,833 --> 03:14:08,550
And if you're aimless and hopeless, you're anxious and fractionated and people can't unite in their beliefs.

2447
03:14:08,650 --> 03:14:10,416
Like the alternative is not good.

2448
03:14:11,333 --> 03:14:13,500
Reversing the enlightenment is no small task.

2449
03:14:15,033 --> 03:14:18,016
Well, hopefully we can save the best of the enlightenment as well.

2450
03:14:18,566 --> 03:14:23,433
It's like the Chesterton's fence of Chesterton's fence.

2451
03:14:24,500 --> 03:14:27,150
Like how many different fences are in the field, so to speak.

2452
03:14:27,500 --> 03:14:30,716
And if we've thrown this one out and we're trying to plug it back in, but which bit of it's going back in the ground?

2453
03:14:30,716 --> 03:14:35,466
One of the things that's very interesting, and I think people like Dawkins have started to realize this,

2454
03:14:35,500 --> 03:14:48,600
and I know that people like Douglas Murray and Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Neil Ferguson have recognized this, is that with the death of God, many other things die, things you don't expect.

2455
03:14:48,633 --> 03:14:53,516
And one of the things that dies when God dies is science, and no one expected that.

2456
03:14:53,850 --> 03:14:54,050
How so?

2457
03:14:56,033 --> 03:14:58,816
Because science as a practice is a religious practice.

2458
03:14:59,650 --> 03:15:01,366
It's predicated on religious axioms.

2459
03:15:01,633 --> 03:15:01,816
Is it?

2460
03:15:02,800 --> 03:15:04,850
Well, you have to believe that there's such a thing as truth.

2461
03:15:06,516 --> 03:15:08,550
You have to believe that the truth is understandable.

2462
03:15:09,716 --> 03:15:12,600
You have to believe that understanding the truth is good.

2463
03:15:13,833 --> 03:15:15,916
You have to believe that there is such a thing as good.

2464
03:15:16,900 --> 03:15:23,266
Right, so imagine, to be a scientist, you have to imagine that, first of all, that the world is comprehensible to the human intellect.

2465
03:15:23,850 --> 03:15:30,866
but more that if you investigate the mysteries of the material world, that that will be beneficial, right?

2466
03:15:31,133 --> 03:15:32,366
Those aren't scientific claims.

2467
03:15:32,700 --> 03:15:33,866
Those are metaphysical claims.

2468
03:15:35,200 --> 03:15:37,866
And that metaphysical claim is nested in a story.

2469
03:15:39,666 --> 03:15:48,600
You know, and the enlightenment types, they've portrayed the scientific revolution as something contrary to the religious substrate, and that's not accurate.

2470
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:51,183
That's a French revolution.

2471
03:15:51,666 --> 03:15:54,033
That's a Luciferian intellect history.

2472
03:15:54,533 --> 03:15:55,183
It's not true.

2473
03:15:55,700 --> 03:15:57,350
The universities grew out of the monasteries.

2474
03:15:58,466 --> 03:15:59,750
That's where the universities came from.

2475
03:16:00,200 --> 03:16:05,283
And science as a widespread enterprise got its start in the universities.

2476
03:16:06,166 --> 03:16:07,200
They grew out of the monasteries.

2477
03:16:07,533 --> 03:16:08,833
That's not questionable.

2478
03:16:09,866 --> 03:16:14,550
Like if you go to Harvard, or if you go to Oxford and Cambridge, it's just starkly evident.

2479
03:16:15,266 --> 03:16:18,716
The layout of the colleges is a monastic layout.

2480
03:16:19,600 --> 03:16:27,166
So the idea that there is some fundamental contradiction between religious belief and the scientific enterprise,

2481
03:16:30,116 --> 03:16:31,883
there's nothing about that that's true.

2482
03:16:32,800 --> 03:16:41,533
And part of the reason that we're losing the scientific enterprise right now is because we've unmoored it from its metaphysical substrate and it can't survive.

2483
03:16:42,166 --> 03:16:44,800
If you're gonna be a scientist, you have to put the truth above all else.

2484
03:16:45,366 --> 03:16:46,550
Scientists are very rare.

2485
03:16:47,450 --> 03:16:49,383
You have to believe in the truth to be a scientist.

2486
03:16:49,666 --> 03:16:51,816
I think Dawkins believes in the truth, by the way.

2487
03:16:52,533 --> 03:16:58,766
So he's an atheist, but a very, he's much less of an atheist than he thinks.

2488
03:16:59,516 --> 03:17:00,500
That's my impression.

2489
03:17:02,033 --> 03:17:05,083
Lying scientists are atheistic or just malevolent.

2490
03:17:05,650 --> 03:17:13,216
Dawkins is a truthful scientist, and in so far as he's pursuing the truth, and in so far as he believes that pursuing the truth will set you free,

2491
03:17:14,216 --> 03:17:17,783
then he's walking down a path that's Christian to its core.

2492
03:17:18,600 --> 03:17:29,000
Now, I know he doesn't like that idea, but he also doesn't like the fact that the scientific enterprise seems to be collapsing in terms of its, what would you call, reliability and validity everywhere, so.

2493
03:17:32,300 --> 03:17:32,966
I appreciate you, mate.

2494
03:17:33,250 --> 03:17:35,466
I appreciate the time that we get to spend.

2495
03:17:35,733 --> 03:17:40,100
There always seems to be a very interesting inflection again this morning.

2496
03:17:40,133 --> 03:17:42,250
Yeah, the inflection this time is you're out on tour, eh?

2497
03:17:42,500 --> 03:17:42,733
I am.

2498
03:17:43,316 --> 03:17:44,050
What's your advice for me?

2499
03:17:44,066 --> 03:17:45,116
going to survive life on the road?

2500
03:17:46,833 --> 03:17:52,683
Make sure that when you step on the stage, that you understand how unlikely it is that you have the privilege to do this.

2501
03:17:53,650 --> 03:17:58,300
And make sure you remember that all those people who came to see you, they're hoping for something from you.

2502
03:17:58,916 --> 03:18:01,100
They put in some time and energy to come and see you.

2503
03:18:01,633 --> 03:18:02,850
It matters what you do.

2504
03:18:03,550 --> 03:18:06,350
You go out on that stage with gratitude, right?

2505
03:18:06,866 --> 03:18:07,716
That'll help a lot.

2506
03:18:08,100 --> 03:18:08,966
You've got to remember that.

2507
03:18:09,966 --> 03:18:11,283
It keeps you on the ground too.

2508
03:18:11,566 --> 03:18:14,516
You should be grateful that they're not thrown rocks at you.

2509
03:18:15,750 --> 03:18:18,366
Right, how ridiculous is it that you get to do this?

2510
03:18:18,450 --> 03:18:19,233
How unlikely is it?

2511
03:18:19,250 --> 03:18:19,366
Insane.

2512
03:18:20,100 --> 03:18:20,733
Right, exactly.

2513
03:18:20,916 --> 03:18:23,916
So you keep that first and foremost in your mind.

2514
03:18:23,966 --> 03:18:32,583
You remember that you should be stunningly grateful for the miracle that you have the opportunity to do this because it's ridiculously improbable.

2515
03:18:34,766 --> 03:18:39,200
Yeah, yeah, trying to do that without getting overwhelmed is becoming an increasingly difficult task.

2516
03:18:39,333 --> 03:18:44,116
Yeah, well, part of the way you handle that is that you parse off the jobs that other people can do.

2517
03:18:44,833 --> 03:18:52,366
When you're out on tour, the social element of that can be overwhelming, so you have to protect yourself from that to some degree.

2518
03:18:52,800 --> 03:18:56,483
But the other thing you do is anything anyone else can do,

2519
03:18:57,316 --> 03:19:02,566
get someone to do, and get someone competent and reliable so that all you're focusing on,

2520
03:19:03,733 --> 03:19:07,466
get to the next show on time in the right frame of mind.

2521
03:19:07,800 --> 03:19:08,750
That's your job.

2522
03:19:10,250 --> 03:19:11,500
Other people have their jobs.

2523
03:19:11,600 --> 03:19:14,066
Make sure you're surrounded by people who do their jobs.

2524
03:19:14,400 --> 03:19:19,033
Like our tours so far, they've become increasingly well run.

2525
03:19:20,016 --> 03:19:25,166
I don't worry about travel, hotels, meals, transportation, none of that.

2526
03:19:25,616 --> 03:19:28,900
I worry about getting to the venue one hour ahead of time,

2527
03:19:30,366 --> 03:19:42,066
getting my head in the right place, which has to do with this attitude of gratefulness that I described, and then trying to address a serious problem with all the people who are participating in the audience.

2528
03:19:42,616 --> 03:19:49,583
And then, if it's too much, then distribute the responsibility some more.

2529
03:19:49,816 --> 03:19:50,983
How do you wind down after a show?

2530
03:19:52,016 --> 03:19:53,683
I watch the Trailer Park Boys.

2531
03:19:56,516 --> 03:19:57,283
Of course you do.

2532
03:19:57,333 --> 03:19:57,800
Yeah, yeah.

2533
03:19:58,200 --> 03:20:01,333
Well, after being that good, you have to not be so good for a while.

2534
03:20:01,400 --> 03:20:03,683
And the Trailer Park Boys is a very good way of doing that.

2535
03:20:03,850 --> 03:20:04,966
Counteracting a little bit.

2536
03:20:05,033 --> 03:20:07,866
Yeah, I texted Rogan about this yesterday

2537
03:20:08,350 --> 03:20:11,616
and I thought that he would have, you know, God knows how many shows that guy's done.

2538
03:20:11,933 --> 03:20:13,383
I thought he would have some wisdom for me.

2539
03:20:13,450 --> 03:20:14,983
I said, every time that I do a show,

2540
03:20:15,816 --> 03:20:24,983
I'm so excited after I finish that I find it difficult to kind of wind down and I've got four shows back to back, then we fly to Dubai, then we've got all these shows around the US and Canada

2541
03:20:25,533 --> 03:20:31,400
and I'm nervous that I'm not gonna be able to sleep and then if I don't sleep, then I'm not gonna be able to perform as well tomorrow and then it'll spiral.

2542
03:20:32,366 --> 03:20:35,250
And I thought that he would just have some wisdom And he said, that's a tough one, man.

2543
03:20:35,366 --> 03:20:36,983
To be honest, I've never had any problems sleeping.

2544
03:20:37,016 --> 03:20:38,900
I was like, well, fuck that, I guess, you know?

2545
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:41,750
But no, I'm excited, I'm excited.

2546
03:20:41,816 --> 03:20:44,650
And I'll check back in with you once everything's done.

2547
03:20:44,650 --> 03:20:48,716
We're gonna record one of them properly, fully properly recorded, like a special.

2548
03:20:49,733 --> 03:20:51,416
So that'll be, maybe we'll put it up.

2549
03:20:51,500 --> 03:20:53,833
Maybe it'll just stay for posterity, I don't know.

2550
03:20:54,016 --> 03:20:55,250
But we're gonna have it.

2551
03:20:55,316 --> 03:20:56,666
So yeah, I'm excited.

2552
03:20:56,716 --> 03:20:57,383
Yeah, well, good luck.

2553
03:20:58,000 --> 03:20:58,416
Thank you, man.

2554
03:20:59,200 --> 03:20:59,583
Good luck.

2555
03:20:59,633 --> 03:20:59,866
Thank you.

2556
03:21:00,466 --> 03:21:01,300
Should be a blast.

2557
03:21:01,316 --> 03:21:01,416
Yeah.

2558
03:21:02,216 --> 03:21:02,350
Yeah.

2559
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:04,733
I've learned a lot and as we've said today,

2560
03:21:05,716 --> 03:21:07,500
pushing through discomfort and doing different things

2561
03:21:08,316 --> 03:21:14,850
and following something close to instinct, a lot of the things that I'm saying are like vulnerable in some regards, I guess.

2562
03:21:14,916 --> 03:21:16,266
You know, they're things that are meaningful to me

2563
03:21:17,166 --> 03:21:21,066
and yeah, I hope that people take a lot away from it and I hope they have done from today too.

2564
03:21:21,450 --> 03:21:28,100
So one of the things I do when I go on stage is like I spend the first 10 or 15 seconds looking at the audience.

2565
03:21:28,750 --> 03:21:29,883
Like I don't mean as a crowd.

2566
03:21:30,050 --> 03:21:31,100
I've seen you do this a lot.

2567
03:21:31,683 --> 03:21:33,583
I would technically refer to it as stalking.

2568
03:21:35,366 --> 03:21:37,150
But it's not far from a stalk.

2569
03:21:37,800 --> 03:21:39,316
It's good, I look everywhere.

2570
03:21:40,366 --> 03:21:42,100
And this is an exposure technique.

2571
03:21:42,150 --> 03:21:43,850
You don't wanna be afraid of the audience at all.

2572
03:21:44,700 --> 03:21:46,833
And you don't wanna be talking to the audience.

2573
03:21:47,333 --> 03:21:50,466
So I look at people and I see, I look everywhere.

2574
03:21:51,483 --> 03:21:56,666
And you can't see in the back rows if it's a big place, but fundamentally I look everywhere I can.

2575
03:21:56,750 --> 03:22:01,050
And I look at individuals and I'm marking them out as people and then I'm remembering, you know,

2576
03:22:01,550 --> 03:22:08,433
I'm talking to all these individual people who've come here and then that's easy, because you can talk to individuals and they're your guests, eh?

2577
03:22:08,700 --> 03:22:11,166
That's another thing for your staff to know too.

2578
03:22:11,916 --> 03:22:17,366
It's like everyone who comes to one of your events has to be treated in the most positive possible way,

2579
03:22:17,400 --> 03:22:22,700
because they're looking to you for something, you know, and it's very hard on them if they're treated inhospitably.

2580
03:22:22,766 --> 03:22:24,700
And so, you know, one of the things we've tried to do,

2581
03:22:25,500 --> 03:22:27,166
I travel with a fair number of people now,

2582
03:22:28,233 --> 03:22:32,716
But everyone knows that like rule number one is treat the audience members,

2583
03:22:33,116 --> 03:22:41,650
even the ones that have some trouble and maybe even are troublesome, it's like treat them like they're guests because they're guests and you're bloody lucky that they're here.

2584
03:22:41,950 --> 03:22:43,750
So don't get all high and mighty about it

2585
03:22:44,366 --> 03:22:47,300
because they put in their time and effort to come here and they're looking for something.

2586
03:22:47,366 --> 03:22:49,450
So that's part of that gratitude.

2587
03:22:51,100 --> 03:22:52,916
And then it's fun, right?

2588
03:22:52,950 --> 03:22:53,750
That keeps it fun.

2589
03:22:54,266 --> 03:22:57,350
It's like you're so privileged to be there talking to them.

2590
03:22:57,750 --> 03:22:58,650
You gotta have that in mind.

2591
03:22:59,016 --> 03:23:01,850
What a privilege it is that, what is these people?

2592
03:23:01,900 --> 03:23:03,683
They're coming to listen to what you're doing.

2593
03:23:04,016 --> 03:23:05,216
That's a good deal, man.

2594
03:23:05,633 --> 03:23:06,733
That's as good as it gets.

2595
03:23:07,366 --> 03:23:11,466
So you wanna have that firmly in the back of your mind and the front too.

2596
03:23:13,650 --> 03:23:14,200
I'll try my best.

2597
03:23:14,400 --> 03:23:15,233
Jordan Peterson, ladies and gentlemen.

2598
03:23:15,233 --> 03:23:17,200
Jordan, thank you so much for today.

2599
03:23:17,266 --> 03:23:18,816
I'm looking forward to the next time we get to catch up.

2600
03:23:19,166 --> 03:23:20,016
Good to talk to you, Chris.

2601
03:23:20,566 --> 03:23:22,200
Thank you very much for tuning in.

2602
03:23:22,333 --> 03:23:28,166
If you enjoyed that episode with Jordan, you will love my conversation with Douglas Murray, which is available right here.

2603
03:23:29,500 --> 03:23:29,700
Go on.

2604
03:23:30,950 --> 03:23:31,216
Tap it.

2605
00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:05,150
你说你有道德义务去做非凡的事情

2606
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:05,250
为什么

2607
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:21,650
嗯 我认为部分原因是因为生活如此困难和充满挑战 除非你全力以赴 否则你很可能会变得痛苦

2608
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:26,683
然后你就会成为黑暗而非光明的力量

2609
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:41,633
所以 你知道 生活的短暂和残酷可以吓到你去躲藏和逃避 但它也可以--

2610
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:48,933
你可以将其颠倒过来 并明白这一点 即 既然你无论如何都可能会承担冒险的风险--

2611
00:00:49,750 --> 00:01:04,550
这是一件非常值得理解且非常有用的事情 即 没有什么比事实更冒险的了

2612
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:07,200
这是我用很长时间才弄明白的事情

2613
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,250
嗯 你可以精心构造你的言辞来得到你想要的

2614
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:18,766
你知道 人们一直都在这样做 他们精心构造言辞 这样他们就可以避免承担他们应该承担的责任

2615
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:22,933
他们可以构造言辞来获得他们真正不应得的优势

2616
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:31,866
这就是当你操纵时所做的 问题在于 你可能会说 如果（通过这样）我可以得到我想要的东西 那么为什么不这样做 而答案是

2617
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:42,900
在“判断你自己需要什么”这一点上 你不一定是最佳的裁判者 而且在“你想要什么”这件事情上 你很容易被误导 这就是人们追求权力时所追逐的那种错觉

2618
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:54,633
如果你决定改为“只说你认为真实的话” 你必须放下关于后果的顾虑 你可能会想 我不想放下 因为我想控制正在发生的事情

2619
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,583
但你会错过冒险 因为如果你不控制正在发生的事情

2620
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,350
你就不知道最终会发生什么

2621
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:03,300
也许那很刺激

2622
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,200
事实上这是毫无疑问的

2623
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:13,733
然而 如果你试图说出你认为真实的话 并试图以你认为最合适的方式行事 你还有额外的优势

2624
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,950
就是真正的你 你背后有现实的力量

2625
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:24,700
显然 如果你试图活在真理中 那你所拥有的 在你背后的 就是现实的力量

2626
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:26,233
那看起来像是一笔好交易

2627
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,433
你同时拥有现实和冒险

2628
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,083
那么 为什么这是一种道德义务

2629
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:43,583
嗯 如果你隐瞒躲藏 你不让内在的东西释放出来 不把你能带来的东西带到这个世界上 你会变得愤世嫉俗和痛苦 你就会开始做非常黑暗的事情

2630
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:56,083
所以你会开始 不仅是你不会为世界增加你能增加的东西 而且你会开始嫉妒那些有能力并且做得好的人 并努力摧毁他们

2631
00:02:57,033 --> 00:03:00,916
所以那真的是通往地狱的道路

2632
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:07,200
我最近最反对的趋势之一就是愤世嫉俗

2633
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,516
有一种普遍的信念认为一切都是糟糕的

2634
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:24,433
情况不会变好 认为情况可以改善的人是愚蠢和妄想的 问题在于我不知道这种想法从何而来

2635
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:37,566
好吧 这是智慧的开始 愤世嫉俗 这是它难以对抗的部分原因 因为人们开始时是天真的 天真的人是乐观的 但其实并非如此

2636
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:48,966
他们只是天真 天真的人不知道世界上有恶意 他们不知道他们自己心中也有恶意 他们是被庇护和依赖的

2637
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:53,416
当这种情况破裂时 它通常会演变为愤世嫉俗

2638
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,216
因此 愤世嫉俗实际上是一种进步

2639
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,533
你的眼前的面纱已经被揭开

2640
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
确切地说 确切地说

2641
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:06,783
愤世嫉俗的问题在于 特别是如果它与某种傲慢结合在一起 你可能就会止步于此 这是一个大错误

2642
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:12,983
那么问题就变成了 一旦你受到严重打击 不再天真

2643
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:16,316
好吧 这么说吧 这对你的乐观情绪非常不利

2644
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:24,450
那么问题就是 一旦你受过伤 怎样才能恢复那种乐观 而不是回到你无法做到的那种天真 又或是让自己变得盲目

2645
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:32,716
答案是你用勇气代替天真 并且作为一种道德命令 重新获得你的乐观

2646
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,450
所以你可能会问自己的一个问题是

2647
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,650
如果未来可能会以各种不同的方式出现灾难性的情况--这绝对是事实 无论是社会上还是个人上--

2648
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,516
那么你应该以什么态度来对待呢

2649
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:51,066
答案可能是 如果你勇敢且有信念--

2650
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:53,433
我可以解释这意味着什么--

2651
00:04:54,533 --> 00:05:02,166
那么你就会以一种直面未来的方式行事 认为你可以处理它

2652
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:05,150
这是我们应该在政治上采取的假设

2653
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:16,900
那些利用恐惧来获取权力的人指出了可能降临在我们身上的各种灾难

2654
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:22,300
反驳他们是很困难的 因为未来总是一个世界末日般的地平线

2655
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:29,950
一切都可能崩溃 之前发生过 可能再次发生 事实上 随着你的衰老和死亡 它也会在你的生活中发生

2656
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:33,283
因此 很容易构想出一场末日

2657
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,983
那么问题变成了 问题不在是 那场末日是否可能成真

2658
00:05:39,116 --> 00:05:42,666
因为答案是肯定的 （问题变成）你对此应该持有什么态度

2659
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:44,966
天真 那不好

2660
00:05:45,316 --> 00:05:48,550
愤世嫉俗 （比天真好一点） 但仍然不好

2661
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:49,683
这是另一种形式的地狱

2662
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:53,116
它也往往使潜在的末日更有可能发生

2663
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,016
那么 当你超越愤世嫉俗时 你得到了什么

2664
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:58,883
当你超越愤世嫉俗时 你得到的是智慧

2665
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,833
这不是天真 而是勇敢

2666
00:06:02,516 --> 00:06:10,916
宗教人士在近年来相对做得不好的一件事是 他们未能划清信仰和勇气之间的关系

2667
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:18,900
你知道 像道金斯和新无神论者这样的人 他们直指信仰 并将其描述为类似于对愚蠢迷信的信仰

2668
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:23,000
但那实际上并不是信仰在最深层意义上的含义

2669
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:32,533
（真正含义）意味着你愿意付诸实践 无论浪潮有多大 你都能驾驭浪潮

2670
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,483
我们可以一起做到这一点 特别是如果我们是出于善意的话

2671
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:42,400
我认为这是面对未来的一种更合适的方式

2672
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:47,116
这也是对愤世嫉俗的适当治愈

2673
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:56,083
现在 关于愤世嫉俗的另一个有趣之处是 愤世嫉俗者对自己的愤世嫉俗不够愤世嫉俗 对吧

2674
00:06:56,216 --> 00:07:02,233
因为你可以怀疑到开始怀疑自己的愤世嫉俗的有效性

2675
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,283
就像 是什么让你这么聪明

2676
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,916
是什么让你成为存在的评判者

2677
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,966
科伦拜因小孩就是那样

2678
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:20,833
你知道 他们认为 鉴于存在本身的残酷性 （所以）存在本身是无法维持的 正确的回应是对个人、人类和上帝竖起巨大的中指 对吧

2679
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,250
好吧 这是一种对愤世嫉俗进行愤世嫉俗的方式

2680
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:29,133
你的愤世嫉俗如何让你逃脱责任 对吧

2681
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:37,100
你的愤世嫉俗如何为你逃避必要的责任 并为你追求自己的短期享乐主义的收益而提供理由

2682
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,050
就像 你为什么不对自己的怀疑感到愤世嫉俗呢

2683
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,833
这是智慧开始的另一个地方

2684
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:47,200
就像 所以这是两个 对吧

2685
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:52,750
愤世嫉俗胜过天真 但它不是最终目的地

2686
00:07:52,950 --> 00:08:03,650
你应该足够愤世嫉俗 以质疑你自己的怨恨和你自己转身离开世界的道德合法性

2687
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,400
鉴于我们不知道未来

2688
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:10,183
鉴于我们的许多动机对我们来说是不可见的

2689
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:15,366
我们自己不是一个我们可以看穿的清澈的池塘

2690
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:19,716
你不得不对未来会发生什么有某种形式的错觉

2691
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,616
你尽力去看它将如何发生 但鉴于玻璃杯可能是半空还是半满

2692
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,966
（那么）为什么不拥有一个对你有用的错觉呢

2693
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:33,750
即 即使在明白到、理解到事情可能会困难并且会有障碍的情况下 也要有一种希望

2694
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:43,966
你知道 有一个社会心理学派在相当长一段时间里一直在探讨这个论点 认为人们必须对未来抱有积极的幻想

2695
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,400
这是人们避免绝望和增强自尊的基本方式

2696
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:57,816
但我不认为... 我们需要区分幻想和错觉之间的区别

2697
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:00,933
你对未来确实有一个幻想

2698
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,766
你必须有 因为像你说的 它不是结构化的

2699
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:06,950
所以你必须暂时性地绘制未来

2700
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,283
即计划

2701
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,016
积极的目标

2702
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:09,983
即策略

2703
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,983
但这并不意味着它是一种错觉

2704
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:18,100
当地图与下面的实际地形没有任何关系时 它（才）是一种错觉

2705
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:23,666
所以如果你对未来有一个行动计划 比方说 你的未来行动计划是--

2706
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:28,666
仅仅为了讨论--是在三年内拥有五百万YouTube订阅者

2707
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:40,583
嗯 你没有严格意义上的证据表明事情会这样发展 因为从现在到三年后 任何事情都可能发生

2708
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,183
但没有理由称这是一种错觉

2709
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:57,033
这是一条假设上可能的潜在路径 然后你可以做出必要的牺牲来实现这一点

2710
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,633
所以即使它是一种幻想--因为它映射了一些不存在的东西--

2711
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:11,316
但它不是错觉 只有当你忽略自己经验中的元素--这些元素会更有效地筹划你的幻想时--它才成为错觉

2712
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:18,750
你忽略它们 以便在不付出相应代价的情况下生活在对未来的积极描述中

2713
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:24,516
我过去几年学到的我最喜欢的想法之一是来自伊赛亚·伯林的内部城堡 你知道吗

2714
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,466
所以 伊赛亚·伯林说 当通往人类成就的自然道路被阻挡时

2715
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:39,083
人们会退缩到自己内心 自我陶醉 并试图在内心创造那个世界 即一些邪恶命运在外部否认给他们的世界

2716
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,483
这往往是一种错觉

2717
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:45,716
如果你无法从世界上获得你真正渴望的东西时 你会教会自己不再去渴望那些东西

2718
00:10:46,116 --> 00:10:50,466
如果你不能得到你想要的的东西时 你必须教会自己去想要那些你能得到的东西

2719
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,166
这是一种心灵上的退却 深入到某种内心的堡垒中

2720
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:58,383
你将自己封锁起来 以防世界上所有令人恐惧的弊病

2721
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,766
我们共同的朋友罗伯·亨德森以更简单的方式解释了这一点

2722
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,033
如果你的腿受伤了 你可以尝试治疗腿

2723
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:10,333
如果你不能 那么你就截断腿 并宣称对腿的渴望是错误的 必须被抑制

2724
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,483
我认为我们到处都可以看到这一点

2725
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:20,966
好吧 那么想象一下 你制定了一个计划 它遇到了障碍 打乱了计划的基础

2726
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:22,700
好吧 现在你撤退

2727
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,266
好的 当你撤退时 你有一个选择

2728
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:32,283
其中一个选项是在幻想中构建一个世界 在那里你对那些冤枉了你的人进行报复并获得你想要的东西

2729
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,166
这是通往疯狂的路径

2730
00:11:34,716 --> 00:11:41,183
很多时候 患有严重妄想症的人确实会出现这种情况--该怎么称呼它们--

2731
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:43,233
它们是补偿性的幻想

2732
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:46,666
然后他们开始沉浸其中 往往是数百个小时

2733
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:50,783
所以 再次提到 那些在科伦拜恩高中进行枪击的孩子们

2734
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:56,950
他们在采取可怕行动之前 沉浸在一个幻想世界中数百个小时 对吧

2735
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:05,166
但你也可以重新反思自己 比如说 这就像忏悔和赎罪

2736
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:15,616
这是正确的思考方式 你可以思考 哪些事 你做错了 哪些事 你做得不够 从而导致了你计划的崩溃

2737
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,716
所以这是首次调查

2738
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:20,133
我做了一些牺牲

2739
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:23,250
我试图实现一个特定形式的未来

2740
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,166
它没有发生

2741
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,133
好吧 为什么

2742
00:12:25,616 --> 00:12:30,466
好吧 世界与我为敌 宇宙是邪恶的 没有上帝 我充满了痛苦和愤世嫉俗

2743
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:33,166
这是一种可能的解释 对吧

2744
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,583
可怜的我 对吧

2745
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:41,016
我不是在轻视这个 因为有时人们的梦想相当现实 但他们仍然灾难性地失败

2746
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:42,400
你知道 这可能是残酷的

2747
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:49,166
你知道 也许你确实做了很多好的决定 但你突然生病了 或者你家里的某个人生病了 一切都对你不利了

2748
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,800
失败不一定是因为你做了一些根本上愚蠢的事情

2749
00:12:54,766 --> 00:12:56,300
这是世界结构的一部分

2750
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:57,700
但这并不重要

2751
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,750
你也可以退回到自己内心 你可以说像这样

2752
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:08,183
好吧 我需要重新考虑我的战略概念 但也可能是我的目标概念

2753
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,916
也许我在错误的地方寻找

2754
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:12,166
也许我需要在其他地方寻找

2755
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,850
你可以向启示开放自己

2756
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,000
因此有一段福音书的话与此非常相关

2757
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:21,283
所以基督告诉他的追随者 如果他们敲门 门就会开

2758
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:25,000
如果他们请求 他们将接受 如果他们寻找 他们将找到

2759
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:37,400
所以这听起来很神奇 听起来像是新无神论者会大肆宣扬的东西 但这不是对这句话的明智解释

2760
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:43,583
正确的解释更像是对思维方式的认识

2761
00:13:44,316 --> 00:13:46,100
所以想象你的计划没有成功

2762
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:48,350
好吧 现在你坐下来 对自己说

2763
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:58,433
即使世界在密谋对抗我 我的失败95%是外部事件和其他人的错

2764
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:11,983
那么 我在哪件事上做得不够好 我没注意到哪件事 使我的失败概率更高

2765
00:14:13,316 --> 00:14:17,050
提出这个问题（之前） 你得真的想要知道答案

2766
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:25,800
这意味着敲门、请求或寻求 这不是开玩笑 你必须真正想知道 这是非常痛苦的事情

2767
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:34,233
因为特别是如果你已经全力以赴了 并且你确实有理由感到痛苦的时候

2768
00:14:34,266 --> 00:14:41,866
你将寻找你仍然犯下的错误 发现自己的错误总是非常痛苦的 对吧

2769
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:51,266
特别是如果它们是你喜爱的那些部分 所以你必须愿意剥离自我 这本质上是谦卑的意思

2770
00:14:51,350 --> 00:15:00,483
但优势是--这就是为什么倾听别人如此有用--你可能会发现自己的愚蠢之处 然后你可以停止愚蠢

2771
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:09,716
所以你之所以坦白你的罪 可以说是因为你想发现自己的不足之处 现在这是痛苦的

2772
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:18,716
遇到某人的意见形成的障碍是痛苦的 这可能会显示你在哪里盲目和无知 甚至是（你自己）故意盲目的

2773
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,750
但其优势是你可以纠正错误 然后当你向前时 你会更强大

2774
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:30,133
你知道 我教我的孩子们的一件事 我希望至少取得了一定的成功 那就是

2775
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:37,566
你应该总是问一个愚蠢的问题--这个问题不是指那些不专心的人会问的问题--

2776
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:46,150
如果你在听某人讲话时不明白他们在说什么 并且你表露了这一点

2777
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:55,116
你是在暴露你的无知 并且也许你正在一个满是人的房间里 你认为你是唯一一个愚蠢到不明白（这个问题）的人--顺便说一句 （只你一个不明白）这种情况很少发生--

2778
00:15:55,716 --> 00:16:01,966
问题是 如果你向自己和其他人暴露这种无知 他们可以纠正它

2779
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:05,083
如果你做这个一千次 你就不再无知了

2780
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,816
这也是成功的真正途径

2781
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:12,200
你在你的播客中做到了这一点 因为你提出了真正的问题 罗根也做到了这一点

2782
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:18,666
罗根总是试图变得比他现在更聪明 然后这个方法就有效了 反复迭代

2783
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:26,000
像 如果你问一千个愚蠢的问题并且听取答案 那么你就会知道一千件你之前不知道的事情 其中一些很深刻

2784
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:35,550
因此 这就是在灵魂中寻找未偿还的罪孽并尝试赎罪的好处

2785
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,150
这不是错觉

2786
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,833
这是试图纠正自己

2787
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:43,016
这是错觉的反面 即使（其中）可能也有一种幻想的元素

2788
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:55,166
是的 围绕着那些尽力而为、尽可能做对很多事情但仍然失败的人的讨论 因为世界是随机的 不幸的事情会发生

2789
00:16:56,233 --> 00:17:01,350
幸福 据我看来 存在于你的期望和现实之间的差距中

2790
00:17:02,516 --> 00:17:08,500
但问题在于 那些标准很高的人经常感到缺失

2791
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:18,583
那些这样奋斗的人如何避免因达不到自己的高标准而感到沮丧

2792
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:23,333
我听过你谈论大卫雕像 说了类似于“你还不是你所能成为的全部”的话

2793
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:24,283
是的

2794
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,933
一旦你提出一个理想 你就开始将自己与那个理想进行比较

2795
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:28,633
所以-

2796
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:30,616
嗯 这是个好问题

2797
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:40,800
我的意思是 最终理想也是最终的裁判 因为最终理想是你远远达不到的东西

2798
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,150
这种痛苦可能是你几乎无法忍受的

2799
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:53,833
但然后你要做的是 我想 两件事 是降低理想并提高你对自己潜力的估计

2800
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,033
我说降低理想是什么意思

2801
00:17:57,766 --> 00:18:06,466
嗯 如果你将自己与某人或甚至一个未来的自己进行比较 差距如此之大以至于让你瘫痪

2802
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:11,550
那么你就创造了一个你没有工具去征服的龙

2803
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,366
因此 你必须做的是将龙缩小到适当的大小

2804
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:25,383
你想要将龙缩小到一个你愿意向其靠近的大小 无论那有多小

2805
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:34,333
现在 你知道 如果你在这里 你的理想在那里 这个差距让你难以忍受 那么你就减小这个差距 不断减小这个差距

2806
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:39,783
无论如何 你都必须这么做 因为你不可能一下子从你所在的地方到达完美 对吧

2807
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,283
这将是逐步的

2808
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:52,916
所以你必须用足够高分辨率的代表来填充这个进步的层次结构 以便你可以开始前进

2809
00:18:53,616 --> 00:18:55,366
然后你应该得到支撑

2810
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,633
还有一个福音书的评论非常有趣

2811
00:18:57,716 --> 00:18:59,816
它涉及的是所谓的马太效应

2812
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,900
马太效应是

2813
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:06,583
对于拥有一切的人 我们会给予更多；对于那些一无所有的人 一切都会被夺走

2814
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:12,750
这很残酷 因为它意味着现实是这样工作的：当你在上升时 你会这样上升

2815
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:15,033
对 这很好

2816
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:19,666
这比下降好多了 但当你在下降时 你会这样下降 对吧

2817
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:24,966
就像是下坡然后悬崖 好吧 所以你想避免下坡的道路

2818
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:39,116
好吧 如果上坡道路是这样的 比如说是指数的或几何级数的 那意味着你上坡的第一步有多大并不重要

2819
00:19:39,566 --> 00:19:53,400
即使它们微不足道 即使它们因为你如此无能而让人羞愧 只要你在这方面有纪律 你会非常迅速地加速

2820
00:19:54,133 --> 00:20:01,450
所以这就是好消息 你可以说 你可以采取非常小的步骤 即使是在它们的大小上可能令人羞愧的步骤

2821
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:05,933
你必须对自己承认这一点 但一旦你开始行动

2822
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:15,566
它不是以线性方式滚动 而是以几何方式滚动 这是一个很好的认知 因为它可以减轻你意识到自己愚蠢的刺痛

2823
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:23,316
就像 是的 你知道 每个人都有他们的弱点 比如说 他们感到尴尬的事情

2824
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:29,966
当我第一次开始去健身房时 我多大了 1985年 23岁

2825
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:36,016
我想我当时体重135磅 身高六英尺一寸 非常非常瘦

2826
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,133
我当时腰围27英寸左右

2827
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,350
我烟瘾很大 也喝得太多

2828
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,533
我那时候的状态不好

2829
00:20:44,116 --> 00:20:50,466
我在健身房的第一次尝试 我参加了这个游泳锻炼班

2830
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:55,166
天啊 我 以及一个真的很胖的年轻人--

2831
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,933
可能比我状况好不到哪去--然而大概有七位70岁以上的老太太 她们能游得比我快

2832
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:10,316
那真是相当丢脸 所以我坚持了一个学期 让自己的状态有所提升 然后我开始去健身房

2833
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:19,300
练习举重 那也很艰难 因为你知道我会在该死的卧推架下试图举起75磅的重量

2834
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:25,800
从支架上举起 然后你知道 一些肌肉男会过来告诉我该怎么做

2835
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,850
就像 是的 谢谢你

2836
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,583
但你知道 这很尴尬

2837
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:35,066
很多时候人们不会做像去健身房这样的事 因为他们对自己的外表或身材感到非常尴尬

2838
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:41,166
从底层开始是很痛苦的 但你要从你最薄弱的底层开始

2839
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:48,883
如果你想要纠正弱点 你必须接受自己处于底层的事实 以及第一步将会很痛苦

2840
00:21:48,950 --> 00:22:00,616
你知道 我花了大约三年的时间 但我戒烟了 然后我戒酒了 在大约三年半的时间里我增加了40磅的肌肉 差不多这样

2841
00:22:01,116 --> 00:22:05,266
我基本上不得不停止做那些事 因为我必须一天吃六次 简直疯了

2842
00:22:05,816 --> 00:22:15,283
但我变得更有自信 也更协调了 因为用哑铃锻炼能让你变得协调

2843
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:21,366
因为它锻炼了所有的小韧带和肌腱 所以我的下半身尤其变得更加协调

2844
00:22:21,366 --> 00:22:25,616
然后我就能跳舞了 这样当我出去跳舞时会更好 因为我在研究生期间跳了很多舞

2845
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:30,200
但这一切的要点是 如果你要纠正自己的弱点

2846
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,250
你必须对自己的不足感到羞愧

2847
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:40,666
现在 如果你和你的理想之间的差距太大 以至于让你瘫痪 你就缩小它 对吧

2848
00:22:40,933 --> 00:22:45,050
我们会在一分钟内继续与乔丹交谈 但首先我需要告诉你关于毛伊努伊鹿肉的信息

2849
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,766
毛伊努伊鹿肉是地球上蛋白质最密集、营养最丰富的红肉

2850
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:51,700
谢谢

2851
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:56,666
而且它们是唯一100%野生收获、无压力的肉类

2852
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:03,000
我最喜欢的烹饪方法是直接从冷冻状态开始 两面都撒上大量的盐

2853
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:09,483
在空气炸锅中以最高温度烹饪12分钟 翻面再烹饪12分钟 每次都完美无瑕

2854
00:23:09,616 --> 00:23:11,066
这真是一个生活小窍门

2855
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,816
实际上是乔丹的女儿米凯拉教给我的 她所做的就是吃肉

2856
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,166
所以这就是正确的做法

2857
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:22,150
所有的切割都很棒 但鹿肉条已经成为我在路上旅行时的新宠

2858
00:23:22,316 --> 00:23:33,600
你可以通过下面的链接直接将地球上最健康的红肉送到你的门口

2860
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,300
我在现场表演中一直在谈论的一件事是你的对照组是不正确的

2861
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:54,000
事实上 我们有机会坐下来听地球上任何人的演讲

2862
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:06,216
最优秀的头脑、最佳的运动员、最优秀的思想家、最能言善辩的人都活在当下 我们所有人都能听到那些存在过视频记录的已故人士的声音

2863
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,250
你可以把自己和那个群体比较

2864
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,383
但那不是你的对照组

2865
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:20,316
如果你有动力坐下来听我滔滔不绝三个小时谈论这些深刻的话题 这些有趣的想法

2866
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:31,883
（那其实）你已经从常规群体中脱颖而出了 （因为）你已经在问自己这些几乎没有其他人在问的问题

2867
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:37,083
但因为你的对照组是表现得令人难以置信的高水平的人

2868
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:46,550
我记得在我开始我的播客之前 听你或萨姆或乔的节目 我会想 天哪 他们的回忆力真是了不起

2869
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:56,350
就好像他们有这种瞬间记忆 他们读过的每件事都能浮现在脑海 而且他们能以完全流畅的方式表达出来 等等

2870
00:24:56,883 --> 00:25:03,583
作为一个从未录制过播客的人 你真的是要拿自己和乔·罗根比吗

2871
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:12,200
他录制了一千多集 在舞台上度过了一万个小时 还做了所有这些UFC评论和电视方面的工作 你真的要和他比较吗

2872
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,033
这是不公平的

2873
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:25,033
我看到的问题是 那些对自己有伟大梦想并想要做出伟大成就的人 他们喜欢把目标定得很高 但在比较中却感到沮丧

2874
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:27,333
所以我认为那- 嗯 其中也有一种自豪感 对吧

2875
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:28,850
我可以做到

2876
00:25:29,216 --> 00:25:29,650
我想成为

2877
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:33,650
或者说 我应该拿自己和谁比

2878
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,566
那是一种自豪感 就像 我应该成为那样 甚至我可以成为那样

2879
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:44,000
就像 嗯 也许你可以 但正如你已经指出的 没有经过学徒期 你肯定做不到

2880
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:51,333
对 所以你可以说沮丧实际上与虚假的自豪感成比例

2881
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:59,400
我在我认为是我的第一本书中写了一章 比较你自己和今天的你 而不是和别人

2882
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:02,900
对不起 我有点记不清了 但你明白我的意思

2883
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:07,016
对你来说 正确的比较组是昨天的你

2884
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:15,350
首先 你是唯一适合你的对照组

2885
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:25,433
因为你有一套特定的才能、可能性、局限和悲剧 这些都是独一无二的

2886
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:32,300
所以你可能在某些方面与别人比较 但这不是一个合理的比较

2887
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:38,933
因为你不知道他们被赋予了什么才能 你也不知道他们有哪些你没有的机会 等等

2888
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,616
这根本就不是一个合理的比较

2889
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:45,700
更好的做法是思考你曾经是谁 然后想想 你能在某些方面变得更好吗

2890
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,783
在某些方面变得更好

2891
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,583
关于这一点积极的方面是 答案几乎总是肯定的

2892
00:26:52,966 --> 00:27:05,816
现在你可以将这种转变定位于某个杰出的目标 这是合理的 但这并不意味着你应该与那个目标比较自己

2893
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,850
瞄准某物和将自己与之比较并不完全是同一回事

2894
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,950
再说 你那该死的比较也是一种错觉 你知道吗

2895
00:27:14,016 --> 00:27:18,350
你需要明白的另一件事是 你在看你嫉妒的那个人的时候

2896
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:26,283
实际上你所做的是通过一个非常狭窄的孔径观察他们生活的一个非常薄的切片

2897
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:30,616
你在看他们生活中表现最好的那一小部分

2898
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:37,250
但你也在看被市场营销为最好的那一小部分

2899
00:27:37,316 --> 00:27:42,833
你完全不知道那个人的生活在其整体上可能有多么糟糕

2900
00:27:43,116 --> 00:27:46,150
你不知道 比如说 如果交易是这样的

2901
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:52,100
比如你想成为拉塞尔·布兰德 这是个好例子

2902
00:27:52,516 --> 00:27:56,433
你想成为像他那样有魅力、那样出名的人

2903
00:27:56,866 --> 00:28:03,466
那么你真正的愿望是你能拥有拉塞尔·布兰德所拥有的一切 但没有他的任何问题

2904
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:05,316
得了吧

2905
00:28:06,116 --> 00:28:18,000
我的意思是 这就是 这太 难怪这样的想法会让你感到沮丧 因为它幼稚、充满怨恨、嫉妒、痛苦且不合理

2906
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:20,500
你必须接受好的与坏的

2907
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,033
你必须接受坏的与好的

2908
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:28,600
当人们在想他们希望成为的名人时 他们很少考虑到这一点

2909
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:32,916
最近有一个埃隆·马斯克的采访 他说了一些话

2910
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,983
我的心灵是一场风暴

2911
00:28:35,733 --> 00:28:38,566
我不认为大多数人会想成为我

2912
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:44,783
他们可能认为他们想成为我 但其实并不 他们不了解 他们不懂

2913
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:46,583
你怎么看

2914
00:28:46,816 --> 00:28:50,166
埃隆是很多人可能会仰慕并渴望成为的人物

2915
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:57,750
然而高水平天才的缺点之一是 你可能会将其描述为轻度躁狂

2916
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:02,383
所以这里有一个简单的测试 人们可以做

2917
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:09,083
这是一种所谓的言语流畅性测试 言语流畅性与创造力相关联

2918
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,350
这里有一个简单的言语流畅性测试

2919
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:17,466
在三分钟内写下尽可能多的以T开头的四个字母的单词

2920
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:21,433
好吧 这相当受限 四个字母和T

2921
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:26,666
或者在三分钟内写下尽可能多的以S开头的单词 这就没那么受限了

2922
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:27,550
好的

2923
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:36,166
因此 你所创造的单词数量与你一生的创造性成就之间存在着相当强的相关性

2924
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:42,716
对 尤其是在艺术和言语领域 这与词汇量不同

2925
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:45,083
词汇量是你理解多少单词

2926
00:29:45,866 --> 00:29:48,783
流畅性是你在给定时间内能产生多少单词

2927
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,166
那些单词的运用 是的

2928
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,916
嗯 人们在这方面的差异之大几乎难以想象

2929
00:29:54,100 --> 00:30:01,383
所以有些人 如果让他们做三分钟的四个字母测试 他们可能只会写下12个单词 而有些人会写下150个

2930
00:30:03,016 --> 00:30:09,283
而那些写下150个的人 他们的思维以轻躁躁狂的速度运转

2931
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,000
他们的思考速度快五倍

2932
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,800
叮叮叮叮叮叮叮

2933
00:30:14,566 --> 00:30:17,200
是的 完全没有停歇

2934
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:21,816
当这种状态完全失控时 你会有躁狂

2935
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:23,150
你会遇到一个躁狂的人

2936
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,233
躁狂没什么好的

2937
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:28,166
这就是“狂人”这个词的来源

2938
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:35,150
躁狂的人有成千上万个计划 每个计划都只有一句话长 他们对此超级热情

2939
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:40,400
他们会花光所有的钱去追求这些计划 然后事情立刻变得一团糟

2940
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:45,800
这就是创意方面病态的外部限制

2941
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:51,416
像马斯克这样显然是个天才的人 他在他的内心世界与此抗争

2942
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:54,116
现在我并不是说他躁狂 我没有看到那样的迹象

2943
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:57,616
但像他这样有创造力的人是在那个边缘上

2944
00:30:57,633 --> 00:30:59,550
或者你看看本·夏皮罗这样的人

2945
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:04,133
和本交谈非常有趣 拉塞尔·布兰德也是这样

2946
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:09,783
夏皮罗说话的速度 我想 比我遇到的任何人都快

2947
00:31:09,783 --> 00:31:14,300
但如果你和他在一起 你会很清楚地看到 他的思维速度可能是正常速度的五倍

2948
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,500
那很多

2949
00:31:15,516 --> 00:31:22,083
当我写《意义的地图》这本书时 这是我的第一本书 我很难停止思考 我对那本书很着迷

2950
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,216
所以我每天写大约三个小时

2951
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,683
然后我会思考材料 大约12个小时

2952
00:31:31,533 --> 00:31:35,433
而且这些想法来得比思考还要快

2953
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:38,016
它们大概以我能阅读的速度出现

2954
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,850
如果材料不是特别密集 我可以一分钟阅读大约1200个单词

2955
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:47,950
所以这就是每天16个小时不停的思考

2956
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,933
这也是我开始举重的部分原因

2957
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,383
因为如果我在举重

2958
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,516
当我背上有100磅重时 不可能一分钟思考1200个单词

2959
00:31:56,716 --> 00:31:58,783
确实 这足以让它停下来

2960
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:03,916
这也是我喝酒的原因之一 因为那也是让它停下来的另一种方式

2961
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:13,483
是的 我认为人们为了成为你所钦佩的那个人所付出的代价 是一种非常有趣的视角 来看像埃隆·马斯克这样的人

2962
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:22,383
我的心灵是一场风暴 我不认为大多数人会想成为我 要成为我你需要付出的代价 不是你愿意的

2963
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:30,916
成为地球上最富有的人之一 你可以在舞台上跳舞 发布防弹车 发射火箭进入太空等等

2964
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,500
嗯 是的 但所有的负担呢

2965
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:34,050
代价是什么

2966
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:40,233
马斯克在我看来也是极其负责任的人 我认识一些和他一起工作过的人

2967
00:32:40,283 --> 00:32:50,183
马斯克不仅仅是一个创意天才 他还是一个极其负责任的工程师 而且真正负责任的工程师 他们有非常有趣的思维

2968
00:32:50,216 --> 00:32:53,383
我喜欢和工程师交谈 因为我的姐夫是一位伟大的工程师

2969
00:32:53,450 --> 00:33:01,700
当他理解某件事时 吉姆 当他理解某件事时 他知道如何从原子构建它 对吧

2970
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,016
像他在每一个层面上都理解它

2971
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:14,083
马斯克在我看来是这种罕见的超级创造性和超级负责任的人的结合体 我知道他一直在工作

2972
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:21,283
是的 这种过度发达的执行功能有助于控制那些分散的创造性能量吗

2973
00:33:21,616 --> 00:33:24,866
哦 我们至少暂时将其投入到这件事中 然后我们将转移到另一件事上

2974
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:27,316
是的 是的 绝对是的

2975
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:30,550
埃里克·温斯坦是一个很好的例子

2976
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:35,950
我希望埃里克不会因此感到不快 但埃里克非常有创造力 但他并不特别负责任

2977
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:42,200
所以他的职业很适合他 因为他

2978
00:33:42,233 --> 00:33:48,633
我不知道他是否还在这样做 但他给 Peter Thiel 提供创意 与他合作了很长一段时间

2979
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:50,533
埃里克是一个非常有趣的人

2980
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:58,083
马斯克是超级有创造力的 据我所知也是超级负责任的 而且负责任确实能够带来专注

2981
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:04,500
很多有创造力的人不是特别负责任 这很罕见

2982
00:34:04,616 --> 00:34:08,750
--就像如果你是其中之一--创造力和责任心之间就没有相关性

2983
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,916
好吧 所以如果你是一千人中的一个

2984
00:34:12,516 --> 00:34:18,666
如果你是一千人中最有创造力的一个 也是一千人中最负责任的一个 你就是一百万人中的一个

2985
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,933
马斯克可能更像是一亿人中的一个 对吧

2986
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:24,866
可能是这样

2987
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:28,016
也许更多 或者可能是十亿人中的一个 对吧

2988
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:28,566
也许是

2989
00:34:30,716 --> 00:34:40,066
是的 考虑到随着对他们的审查不断增加 人们以及他们的平台所发生的变化是很有趣的

2990
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:46,450
显然 这对你来说是一段旅程 在接近10年的时间里 是2006年开始的C16吗

2991
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,383
2016年 是的 抱歉

2992
00:34:52,433 --> 00:34:56,116
名声是如何改变你的

2993
00:34:56,566 --> 00:35:03,333
由于审查、监视、崇拜和批评 哪些方面受到了影响或改变

2994
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:13,950
首先改变的 我认为 是我看到了我之前没有真正见过的痛苦规模

2995
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:26,333
我曾作为临床医生工作了很长时间 每周接访大约20个人 我总是处于艰难的存在问题中

2996
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:31,283
我和我的来访者一起努力解决他们的问题 我非常喜欢这样

2997
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:37,633
然后我还有我的研究、我的家庭和各种商业利益

2998
00:35:37,683 --> 00:35:49,083
因此 痛苦在某种程度上被遏制和限制住了 我有很多围绕它的结构 以便能够发挥作用 尽管事实上

2999
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:54,233
你知道 我深陷于20个人的严重问题中 顺便说一下 我真的很喜欢这样

3000
00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:06,733
当我开始在更大的规模上发言并遇见越来越多的人时 泛滥的沮丧真的打击了我

3001
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,566
我不知道这一点 我不知道我们文化中的沮丧已经变得多么深重

3002
00:36:13,366 --> 00:36:17,500
我认为这在当时对我来说特别明显 主要是在年轻男性中

3003
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:25,466
现在 看起来 这是乔纳森·海特的研究所表明的 可能年轻女性的状况甚至更糟

3004
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,350
但出于某种原因 至少一开始 我遇到的大多数人是年轻男性

3005
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:34,933
我认为这可能是因为在YouTube上的大多数人都是年轻男性

3006
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:45,516
因此 看到如此多的沮丧

3007
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:50,866
看到我们文化中泛滥的沮丧是令人震惊且残酷的

3008
00:36:52,366 --> 00:36:56,283
除此之外 这确实让我很震惊 我会说这对我来说非常艰难

3009
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:04,283
除此之外的一切 至少是荒谬地有趣的

3010
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,316
我拥有难以置信的机遇之财

3011
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,283
如果不感到深深的感激的话 我会是个傻瓜

3012
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:16,500
我的意思是 我所见到的痛苦 震惊了我 伤害了我 也是让我生病的一部分原因

3013
00:37:16,566 --> 00:37:17,383
那对你有什么影响

3014
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:19,316
它是否以某种方式改变了你看待世界的方式

3015
00:37:27,283 --> 00:37:34,300
它让我更深刻地理解了 给予人们鼓励的话语是多么重要

3016
00:37:35,666 --> 00:37:43,850
我可以看到很多人因缺乏鼓励的话语而在心理上或事实上死去

3017
00:37:44,716 --> 00:37:54,383
因此 身处能够提供这种帮助的位置变得更加必要

3018
00:37:54,916 --> 00:38:02,050
塔米和我不断地巡回演讲的部分原因是因为 这似乎是好事

3019
00:38:02,566 --> 00:38:03,683
这似乎是件好事

3020
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,716
你知道 我们甚至看到了观众的变化

3021
00:38:07,766 --> 00:38:12,616
大约五年前 六年前 我们进行了第一次巡回演讲

3022
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:16,400
来听讲座的很多人情况都相当糟糕

3023
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,133
当时男性比现在多 男女比例更高

3024
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:26,383
而且男性通常是独自一人来的 很多人看起来相当狼狈

3025
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:31,466
现在 五年后 一半的观众穿着西装

3026
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:34,350
就好像他们是为了婚礼而穿戴整齐

3027
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:37,433
大多数男士都是和某位女士一起来的

3028
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:46,433
观众们过得好多了 演讲活动极为积极

3029
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:56,650
如果你从外面看我的生活 你会认为我一直处于持续的激烈争议之中 但所有这一切 几乎全部都是虚拟的

3030
00:38:57,566 --> 00:38:58,950
这只存在于线上世界

3031
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:08,266
现在 它时不时地触及现实世界 因为我正被位于安大略省的他们所属的专业监管机构追究

3032
00:39:08,266 --> 00:39:08,783
再教育营

3033
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:17,916
是的 是的 是的 这主要只是一种烦恼 一个荒谬的烦恼 一个荒谬的、昂贵的、耗时的烦恼

3034
00:39:18,366 --> 00:39:31,916
但除此之外 围绕我发生的一切都是积极的 这也是奇怪的事情 积极到即使是这样也是令人生畏的

3035
00:39:32,983 --> 00:39:45,850
你知道 你会觉得很难想象你可能处于一种情况中 事情如此积极以至于你几乎无法忍受 但我就处于那种情况中 这是值得应对的事情

3036
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:53,983
我想我在某种程度上很幸运 这种事情直到我年纪大了才发生在我身上 因为我从未真正习惯过它

3037
00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:01,350
我对发生在你身上的事情进行了思考 温斯坦兄弟也是一个很好的例子

3038
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,433
我们经常听到年轻成名的危险

3039
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,983
在世界上的麦考利·卡尔金、布兰妮·斯皮尔斯

3040
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:18,133
那些没有任何身份感的个体 被推入一个非代表性的世界体验中 他们完全失去了方向

3041
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,550
但我认为 如果你认为你知道你是谁 那同样是一个有趣的问题要问

3042
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:34,816
如果你花了几十年 五十年 六十年的时间来理解你的位置、你的地位、你的轨迹 然后突然之间

3043
00:40:35,483 --> 00:40:40,333
你被从所有的参考点中撕扯出来

3044
00:40:40,616 --> 00:40:44,400
所有你认为你知道的路标 现在你就悬在空中

3045
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:48,166
我想象这在某些方面可能更加令人不安

3046
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:59,750
嗯 当一切围绕我爆炸时 起初这很有压力 我会说 因为我的工作岌岌可危 我的大学工作 我从未想过会发生这样的事情

3047
00:40:59,816 --> 00:41:07,500
我的意思是 当我在哈佛大学和多伦多大学工作时 那都是积极的

3048
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,916
像 我真的很喜欢和我的研究生一起工作

3049
00:41:10,016 --> 00:41:16,916
我至少和哈佛的同事们保持着和睦的关系

3050
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:17,950
他们不仅仅是和睦

3051
00:41:18,283 --> 00:41:26,766
在多伦多大学 我开始与的一些教员建立友谊 他们也是最终离开的那些人

3052
00:41:27,483 --> 00:41:32,850
他们通常是收到其他地方的邀请然后就消失了

3053
00:41:32,966 --> 00:41:37,250
因此 我在多伦多大学交往的很多朋友都去了其他地方

3054
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:45,633
因此 我没有像在哈佛那样 与同龄人之间的友谊网络紧密相连

3055
00:41:45,716 --> 00:41:50,483
但我和本科生以及我的研究生有很好的关系 那已经足够了

3056
00:41:50,566 --> 00:41:56,350
像 我喜欢和我的研究生一起工作 所以我并不孤独和愁苦 完全不是 我有一个好的朋友网络

3057
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:05,283
然后这种情况就受到了威胁 并在 2016 年（这种平静）真正消失了

3058
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,433
我的临床实践也受到了威胁 所以那是令人不安的

3059
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,783
我认为有些事情仍在继续

3060
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:21,833
即使当我还是大学教授时 我的教学方式也不平常

3061
00:42:23,066 --> 00:42:24,783
我教的内容也不平常

3062
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:31,350
我思考了了几十年 最终有人会发现我在教什么 你知道的 会有麻烦

3063
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:37,316
我简直不敢相信我被允许 甚至鼓励教我所教的内容

3064
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:46,883
但你知道 大学 尤其是90年代的哈佛 就是这样构建的

3065
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,783
你所教授的内容中 有什么是非常叛逆的呢

3066
00:42:53,066 --> 00:43:01,150
嗯 真的没有人专注于原型理念、原型和宗教理念与神经科学之间的联系

3067
00:43:01,483 --> 00:43:03,450
所以那并不是一件事情

3068
00:43:04,316 --> 00:43:07,366
我的意思是 有一些人 雅克·潘克塞普是其中之一

3069
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:14,516
很多对情感神经科学感兴趣的研究者开始对深层叙事产生兴趣

3070
00:43:15,016 --> 00:43:19,950
因为他们开始理解我们的情感生活是一个故事

3071
00:43:20,183 --> 00:43:21,533
这是一种很好的思考方式

3072
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:26,383
我们被我们的情感本能所指引

3073
00:43:26,383 --> 00:43:30,266
我们的情感本能所做的是将我们置于某些故事之中

3074
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:33,916
这就是恋爱的意义 例如 你处于一个爱情故事之中

3075
00:43:35,066 --> 00:43:39,933
这并不是你意识到的催产素和内啡肽的特定平衡

3076
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:41,883
它不被分解成它的组成部分

3077
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:42,833
不 绝对不是

3078
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:45,633
它是你所告诉自己的叙事--“这意味着什么”和“这感觉如何”--的一部分

3079
00:43:45,766 --> 00:43:46,350
对 对

3080
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:50,350
嗯 本能以故事的形式表现自己是很有趣的

3081
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:53,783
所以我对叙事和故事非常感兴趣

3082
00:43:54,533 --> 00:44:02,400
而且 你看 没有心理学家研究卡尔·荣格 几乎没有

3083
00:44:02,716 --> 00:44:02,900
真的吗

3084
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:05,066
是的 是的 绝对不是

3085
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:14,766
我的意思是 心理学在某种程度上真的作为物质主义对精神分析学的对立面而发展

3086
00:44:15,516 --> 00:44:19,066
所以弗洛伊德和荣格 甚至阿德勒在某种程度上

3087
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:25,600
对科学训练的行为心理学家来说是禁区

3088
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,550
那就是我曾经和现在的身份 我在麦吉尔大学接受训练

3089
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:32,533
在麦吉尔大学没有精神分析理论的课程

3090
00:44:32,983 --> 00:44:35,333
我完全是自学弗洛伊德和荣格的

3091
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:46,650
面对我从善意的研究生导师那里得到的建议 他是一个很棒的人 而且从来没有妨碍过我 恰恰相反 

3092
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:55,083
但例如 当我进入就业市场时 我被警告不要谈论我真正感兴趣的事情 

3093
00:44:55,166 --> 00:45:02,200
顺便说一句 我忽略了这一点 这意味着我去申请工作的一些地方不需要我 

3094
00:45:02,683 --> 00:45:14,816
但后来哈佛做到了 所以结果非常好 你知道 这也是优点之一 忠于自己的愿景也是你不会得到你不想要的东西 

3095
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:19,033
看 我不想去他们不想要我的地方工作 

3096
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:22,116
我想去他们需要我的地方工作 

3097
00:45:22,566 --> 00:45:25,050
所以我的策略是 好吧 这就是我 

3098
00:45:25,616 --> 00:45:35,800
如果你不想要我 你知道 这会很麻烦 因为我正在找工作 但出于同样的原因 我不会假装成别人以便我可以在这里工作

3099
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:46,850
因为这是开始你职业生涯的愚蠢方式 这回到了说实话的问题 如果你说了一个足够诱人的谎言 你能希望得到什么呢

3100
00:45:46,866 --> 00:45:50,466
你对谎言的对象产生了爱慕 他们爱上了一个幻影

3101
00:45:50,483 --> 00:46:01,383
绝对是的 当我申请研究生院时 我写了一封疯狂的录取信 我基本上展示了我是谁 包括我的缺点 以及我感兴趣的东西

3102
00:46:01,416 --> 00:46:15,716
三个人对此感兴趣 我最喜欢的一个 部分原因是因为他在麦吉尔大学 我想去蒙特利尔 是我的研究生导师 罗伯特·皮尔

3103
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:19,033
他知道他将得到什么 我们相处得很愉快

3104
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:26,400
我和他的关系是我一生中非常好的关系之一 而且已经持续了四十年

3105
00:46:26,433 --> 00:46:37,233
因为鲍勃是一个非常诚实的人 我们非常不同 他非常实用 是一个非常好的管理员 一个管理型的人 尽管他非常聪明

3106
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:50,850
他对相关研究心理学文献有着详尽的了解 而我带着精神分析理论、哲学和宗教观念的飞毯进来 非常不同

3107
00:46:50,866 --> 00:47:00,366
尽管我们都对研究的实际操作有着真正深刻的兴趣 他教会了我爱上研究分布的更科学的一端

3108
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:08,883
但我想说的是 他从一开始就知道他将得到什么 我也是（这样）

3109
00:47:08,983 --> 00:47:18,300
这非常奏效 没有任何欺骗的必要 而且事实证明 他的才能和我的完美搭配

3110
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:24,716
所以 我们非常开心 我喜欢和他一起工作 这就是为什么我们合作了40年

3111
00:47:25,283 --> 00:47:31,333
我和鲍勃一起在北美旅行 因为我们还开了一家公司 那非常棒

3112
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,166
那真的很棒

3113
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:39,100
事情是 你知道 如果你告诉人们你是谁 机会就会为你打开

3114
00:47:39,483 --> 00:47:39,683
是的

3115
00:47:40,283 --> 00:47:42,216
不是为你创造的这个谎言打开

3116
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:48,050
道格拉斯·穆雷告诉了我一个关于他早期在一家报纸工作时的首任老板的故事

3117
00:47:48,216 --> 00:47:49,233
我记不得那位先生的名字了

3118
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:53,616
这个人在行业内是个传奇人物

3119
00:47:53,683 --> 00:47:54,700
他工作了很长时间

3120
00:47:54,766 --> 00:48:01,383
他积累了许多反对者和支持者 而在他职业生涯的后期

3121
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:12,950
就在道格拉斯开始他的职业生涯时 他决定要上演一部关于查尔斯王子生活的西区剧 而且是用押韵对句 对于西区剧来说 这很大胆

3122
00:48:13,216 --> 00:48:18,600
显然 因为他在出版界非常知名 所以受到了所有这些审查

3123
00:48:19,383 --> 00:48:26,566
首演之夜 到了中场休息时 整个礼堂没有一个人 包括演员在内

3124
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:30,033
这家伙很受打击 对吧

3125
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,366
他在媒体上被嘲笑等等

3126
00:48:33,116 --> 00:48:36,750
显然道格拉斯之后不久见到了他 友好地问他

3127
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:39,516
他就像 看 你当时在想什么

3128
00:48:40,466 --> 00:48:44,583
关于查尔斯王子生活的西区剧 还用押韵对句

3129
00:48:45,683 --> 00:48:50,766
他说 嗯 道格拉斯 我追随我的直觉 直觉有时可能会引导你走错

3130
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:53,633
但它们是唯一曾经引导你正确的东西

3131
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:54,433
对 对

3132
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,616
这给我留下了深刻印象 因为

3133
00:48:56,916 --> 00:49:02,550
是的 这里也有与直觉相关的非常重要的东西

3134
00:49:03,166 --> 00:49:10,133
好吧 事物会向你招手 呼唤你 你会对哪条道路选择有直觉

3135
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:15,400
你很可能会跟随这些直觉 因为你还能依靠什么呢

3136
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:16,950
你有这些定向的直觉

3137
00:49:18,066 --> 00:49:19,833
这也是为什么你不撒谎的原因之一

3138
00:49:21,366 --> 00:49:23,466
因为如果你撒谎并且练习撒谎

3139
00:49:24,183 --> 00:49:28,300
你会使你的直觉病态化 然后你的直觉会引导你错误

3140
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,416
所以 在福音书中提出了一种罪过

3141
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,450
这是对圣灵的罪 这是不可饶恕的

3142
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:39,483
人们已经争论了大约2000年 这个特定的罪是什么

3143
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:46,716
但它有点像是本能的病态化 这些本能本是用来引导你的

3144
00:49:47,366 --> 00:49:52,166
如果你牺牲了你与真理的关系 你就会扭曲你的视野 然后你就看不见了

3145
00:49:52,900 --> 00:50:01,600
然后有一天 当天黑了 在你面前的雾中会有尖锐的东西 你会因为你已经使你自己的视野病态化而直接走进它们

3146
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:10,866
你不想撒谎 因为你错误地编程了自己 然后你会自动看到不存在的东西

3147
00:50:11,416 --> 00:50:17,866
然后 当然 世界会不断地给你当头一棒 你会想 哦 我的天 这个世界是如此的病态

3148
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:24,050
而事实是 不 你只是不断地碰到那些你拒绝看到的东西

3149
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,566
然后你会认为 嗯 这个世界只是由障碍构成的

3150
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:37,183
这样 你就把障碍放在了自己的道路上 而你是通过发展这些复杂的、自私的错觉来做到这一点的

3151
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:40,666
一个你告诉其他人关于你是谁 但并不真实的故事

3152
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:48,216
你试图规划一张与现实毫无关系的地图 然后你不断地想知道为什么你会偏离道路掉进坑里

3153
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:51,100
这样 怎么可能会有其他结果呢

3154
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:59,883
是的 你看 如果你真的理解这一点 人们已经多次评价过我的勇敢 但我不喜欢这样

3155
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,300
不是那样的

3156
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,833
我害怕的事情与一般的人不同

3157
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:09,466
也许这是一个好的思考方式

3158
00:51:09,883 --> 00:51:15,066
我更害怕说出某些不真实的东西

3159
00:51:15,866 --> 00:51:25,133
或者偏离正确的道路 而不是害怕因为说出我相信的东西和做我认为正确的事情而可能带来的后果

3160
00:51:25,966 --> 00:51:27,250
我更害怕那些

3161
00:51:27,783 --> 00:51:31,433
你知道 我最近在阅读《圣马太福音》

3162
00:51:31,433 --> 00:51:31,800
马太福音

3163
00:51:32,716 --> 00:51:35,266
我目前正在写一本书 叫做《与上帝摔跤的我们》

3164
00:51:35,316 --> 00:51:48,116
其中一点是 基督对人们不断说的是 不要损害他们的视野 不要遮住他们的眼睛 这是表达它的最好方式

3165
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,800
不要遮挡你的眼睛

3166
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,483
如果你愿意看 你可以看到你面前的东西

3167
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,450
如果你愿意看 生活中许多可怕的障碍 你可以绕过去

3168
00:52:01,283 --> 00:52:08,350
但如果你故意使自己盲目 以追随你自己狭隘的、自私的错觉

3169
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:15,133
你会不断地遇到可怕的事情、可怕的人以及你自己灵魂中的可怕部分

3170
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,966
这才是你应该害怕的

3171
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:24,450
但如果你真的这么做了 你能期望的最好的事情就是侥幸成功地过上别人的生活

3172
00:52:24,483 --> 00:52:26,600
对 对 太棒了 多么美妙

3173
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:27,783
是的 确切地说

3174
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:31,550
你变成了一个成功的骗子

3175
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:35,000
我记得一部关于罗恩·杰里米的纪录片

3176
00:52:35,283 --> 00:52:36,550
我想他们叫他刺猬

3177
00:52:36,616 --> 00:52:38,133
他是这位著名的色情影星

3178
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,866
我在音乐视频中见过他 是的

3179
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:40,466
是的 好吧

3180
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:43,316
他并不是世界上最有吸引力的人

3181
00:52:43,783 --> 00:52:46,633
他生活在这个非常有趣的世界里

3182
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:53,416
他生活在这样一个世界里 他经常在街上被人拦下 这些人认为罗恩·杰里米是英雄 对吧

3183
00:52:53,516 --> 00:52:59,833
所以他生活在地狱中 因为崇拜他的人就是那些崇拜他的人

3184
00:53:01,516 --> 00:53:06,666
他被那些认为他是成功化身的人们包围着

3185
00:53:06,866 --> 00:53:09,016
所以他得到了他想要的 我想

3186
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,516
他很容易接近那些容易接近的女人

3187
00:53:13,066 --> 00:53:16,450

3200
00:54:18,983 --> 00:54:19,550
让我给你讲个故事

3201
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:28,166
这就是为什么我认为“非志愿单身男性”（incel）运动和“黑色药丸”（black pill）运动的起源可以追溯到把妹艺术（pickup artistry）的原因

3202
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:40,916
如果你追溯互联网历史 二者的意识形态起源是一个叫做PUAHate（憎恨搭讪艺术家）的subreddit或网站

3203
00:54:41,716 --> 00:54:52,683
它是一群经历了搭讪艺术流程的男人 而被流程训练后的男人 对世界持有更加冷漠甚至更加冷嘲的看法

3204
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:53,650
更加冷漠

3205
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:54,766
是的 我来告诉你为什么

3206
00:54:55,016 --> 00:55:02,350
所以 如果一个人学习了20世纪初期的老式搭讪艺术

3207
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:08,666
他会意识到有一套特定的行动 一种可以执行的脚本

3208
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,850
这使得女人和你上床的可能性更高

3209
00:55:13,883 --> 00:55:24,250
但当你这样做 学会了贬低（neg）和肢体接触升级（Kino escalation） 告诉她们预先筹划好的故事 按照特定的脚本来进行整个流程

3210
00:55:25,016 --> 00:55:32,283
（而后）你会开始意识到你自己与你实际上呈现的你有多么远

3211
00:55:32,616 --> 00:55:32,766
对

3212
00:55:33,366 --> 00:55:41,833
你是谁 以及你需要将自己扭曲成什么样的夸张人物 才能与这个女人上床 这会让你感到-

3213
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:42,783
甚至更糟

3214
00:55:44,366 --> 00:55:48,350
感受到你现在的位置与你为了实现你想要的东西而必须做的事之间的差距

3215
00:55:48,383 --> 00:55:54,183
现在你没有意识到 还有无数其他方式可以让你变得足够迷人以让这个人喜欢你

3216
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,866
这只是- 比如 通过实际行动

3217
00:55:57,350 --> 00:56:04,650
这（PUA）只是一个恰好足够健壮 足够简单以至于可以写在书上 大多数男人可以复制的方法

3218
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:07,033
是的 这基本上是一种编写好的精神病

3219
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:11,650
所以 精神病患者所做的就是假装胜任 对吧

3220
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,700
所以大多数精神病患者在情感上非常稳定

3221
00:56:15,383 --> 00:56:24,216
因此 胜任的早期标志之一就是沉着和冷静

3222
00:56:25,016 --> 00:56:29,850
因此 如果你不是一个焦虑的人 你已经在这方面有了优势

3223
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,783
大多数精神病患者在情感稳定性上得分很高

3224
00:56:33,683 --> 00:56:38,133
因此 他们看起来很自信 因为自信的人通常不那么紧张

3225
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,016
比如 如果你正在做一件你擅长的事情 嗯 你不会紧张 因为你知道如何做

3226
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,166
好吧 所以不紧张暗示着能够胜任

3227
00:56:46,466 --> 00:56:47,650
嗯 你可以假装这一点

3228
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,250
你可以假装胜任

3229
00:56:49,766 --> 00:56:51,500
你可以假装自信

3230
00:56:51,716 --> 00:56:53,366
这就是搭讪艺术家教的东西

3231
00:56:53,483 --> 00:56:57,316
现在 我会说他们所做的事情甚至还有一些用处 对吧

3232
00:56:57,416 --> 00:57:10,700
因为如果你依赖他人、心怀怨恨、充满怨气、没有魅力、自毁倾向、紧张并且社交技巧欠缺

3233
00:57:11,116 --> 00:57:14,816
那么你成功吸引女性的可能性非常、非常低

3234
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:17,916
好吧 所以你不应该是现在的你

3235
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:24,683
现在 如果你开始装扮这个角色 那么你可以把它看作是一套新衣服

3236
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:28,483
你可以通过它学习如何填补空缺

3237
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:29,566
假装它直到你做到为止

3238
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:30,983
绝对 绝对是的

3239
00:57:31,466 --> 00:57:37,650
但如果你在没有做出必要的努力来真正整合它的情况下扮演这个角色

3240
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:43,500
那么所发生的一切就是你因为假装而得到奖励 对吧

3241
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:50,033
这也是问题的一部分 就是你正在练习如何以精神病患者的方式操纵人

3242
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:53,650
如果你练习这个 当然你会变得更加冷漠

3243
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:56,233
像没有比精神病患者更冷漠的了

3244
00:57:56,766 --> 00:58:00,683
我的意思是 那是冷漠的极端表现

3245
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:06,433
如果你练习操纵 特别是如果女性恰好是相当好的女性

3246
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:13,966
如果你练习操纵她们并且成功了 那么你正在学习成为一个 你正在学习成为一个可怕的人

3247
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:22,666
现在 你知道 作为你之前完全无用、没有生产力、不受欢迎的自己 你本来就不怎么出色

3248
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:28,500
但是用精神病代替那样的自己 就像用愤世嫉俗代替天真一样

3249
00:58:28,966 --> 00:58:46,816
现在 作为一个复杂的问题 我指的是部分原因是像安德鲁·泰特这样的人对年轻人如此有吸引力 是因为他们展示了那种虚假的自信

3250
00:58:47,866 --> 00:58:54,700
泰特是个复杂的人物 因为并不是所有的都是虚假的 你知道 真正的人物很复杂 就像漫画书中的反派那样简单

3251
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:56,766
泰特是个斗士

3252
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:00,533
显然 他具有一定程度的身体勇气

3253
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:01,733
那是真的

3254
00:59:02,716 --> 00:59:02,983
好的

3255
00:59:04,566 --> 00:59:14,450
对于那些生活在地下室的失败者来说 他所说的某些元素非常有吸引力 因为至少他在外面的世界

3256
00:59:14,966 --> 00:59:20,150
你知道 承受打击 他有快车 他酷炫 他吸引女性

3257
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:26,650
但他所做的很多事情 尤其是与女性相关的 不仅仅是濒临精神病患者的边缘 而是越过了界限

3258
00:59:27,283 --> 00:59:29,700
那不是一个好榜样

3259
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:37,116
对于那些试图进步的人来说 这不是一个最佳模式 但这是一件奇怪的事情 因为正如愤世嫉俗比天真好一样

3260
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:44,033
拥有黑暗的能力比完全没有黑暗的能力要好

3261
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:52,133
因此 所以泰特很有吸引力 因为他的阴影吸引着未成熟的人 对吧

3262
00:59:52,183 --> 01:00:00,966
因为确实如此 就好像你神经质、依赖、压抑 因为你不成熟、无害

3263
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:03,766
摆脱这种状态的一种方式是停止无害

3264
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:07,716
关于泰特 你可以说的一件事是 他不是无害的 对吧

3265
01:00:07,783 --> 01:00:09,066
这是一种美德

3266
01:00:11,016 --> 01:00:13,600
现在 这是一种需要加以限定的美德

3267
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:19,666
就像愤世嫉俗与天真相比是一种美德 但它本身并不是美德

3268
01:00:19,966 --> 01:00:21,233
这是通往目标的一步

3269
01:00:22,183 --> 01:00:28,816
所以也许你可以学会如何假装自信 也许这是一种进步

3270
01:00:29,216 --> 01:00:34,733
我在我的临床实践中有一个来访者参与了搭讪艺术家社区 他教会了我很多关于它的知识

3271
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:41,400
他们的新手必做的练习之一是在一天之内向50名女性索要电话号码

3272
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,316
这是一个很棒的练习

3273
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,366
你知道 我不是建议-

3274
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,683
暴露疗法 接近焦虑

3275
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:47,333
绝对 绝对

3276
01:00:47,883 --> 01:00:51,466
克服拒绝的恐惧 对吧

3277
01:00:51,516 --> 01:00:55,316
而且他们会这样做50次 因为你会被拒绝绝大多数次

3278
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:55,533
50次

3279
01:00:55,916 --> 01:00:57,083
嗯 很可能50次

3280
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:59,816
尽管通常这不是人们的经历

3281
01:01:00,383 --> 01:01:05,516
如果他们甚至略微熟练 他们至少会得到一个虚假的电话号码

3282
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:14,966
但他们学到的是 拒绝并不像他们想象的那样灾难性 更重要的是 他们学到了在拒绝面前继续前进的方法

3283
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:21,950
所以它让我想到的是知识分子的谦逊以及人们如何坚定地坚持他们的信仰

3284
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:28,783
如果你相信自己永远是对的 外界没有什么是你需要学习的

3285
01:01:29,316 --> 01:01:35,050
那么任何承认自己可能错了的行为都等于毁灭 它的作用完全相同

3286
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,650
你需要 这回到了“提出愚蠢问题”上

3287
01:01:38,983 --> 01:01:48,900
要准备提出愚蠢问题 不像房间里最了解情况的人 但也远非最愚蠢的人 因为你是在提问的人

3288
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:56,433
房间里最愚蠢的人是那些不知道而且不问的人 或者更糟的是 那些不知道却假装知道的人

3289
01:01:56,683 --> 01:01:57,133
啊 是的

3290
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,400
那根本就不好 是的

3291
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:03,133
这是来自你的- 看 这就是为什么你应该爱你的敌人的一部分想法

3292
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:05,666
你可能会问 为什么要这样做

3293
01:02:05,783 --> 01:02:08,633
好吧 你的敌人将是你最严厉的批评者

3294
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:16,500
现在如果你有一个非常好的敌人 他会向你展示你之前不知道的性格缺陷

3295
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:25,833
所以这是一个非常 这是一个非常奇怪的看世界的方式 认为你应该欢迎攻击

3296
01:02:25,983 --> 01:02:32,516
你应该这样做 但这是我说的 带着所有应有的谨慎

3297
01:02:33,866 --> 01:02:44,133
攻击得越凶恶 那么你的潜在隐藏缺陷可能被揭示得越多

3298
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,133
你认为这是真的吗

3299
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:46,066
哦 绝对

3300
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:58,150
但我也发现 攻击迫使你应对它 看看它是否存在 对 去测试它

3301
01:02:58,616 --> 01:03:04,583
我想对我发起的最成功的攻击几乎总是记者

3302
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,450
他们通常是英国的女性记者 但不总是

3303
01:03:08,483 --> 01:03:12,616
我们培养了一个勇敢的记者国家

3304
01:03:12,966 --> 01:03:22,383
是的 而且在英国 人们对记者的信任是西方世界中最低的 我明白为什么了 你知道 但这有些好处

3305
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:25,650
面对某人有一些真正的好处

3306
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,033
这是一个法利赛人问题

3307
01:03:28,716 --> 01:03:33,833
在福音书中 基督总是与这些法利赛人争论

3308
01:03:34,116 --> 01:03:38,133
法利赛人总是试图为他设置一个言语陷阱

3309
01:03:38,266 --> 01:03:38,666
所以他是-

3310
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:39,816
法利赛人是民族吗

3311
01:03:39,866 --> 01:03:42,083
法利赛人是一个犹太教派

3312
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:42,933
好的

3313
01:03:43,483 --> 01:03:47,083
法利赛人在他们对摩西律法的解释中非常法理主义

3314
01:03:47,116 --> 01:03:53,600
因此 他们在福音书中的描绘中是伪善的 按照规则的道德主义者

3315
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:58,083
而他们的大部分道德都是为了表演

3316
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,516
他们喜欢在公众面前祈祷

3317
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:01,333
他们喜欢被看到是圣洁的

3318
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:04,200
至少这是对他们的批评

3319
01:04:04,283 --> 01:04:12,700
在福音书的记载中 他们总是试图为基督设置一个言语陷阱 以此将他暴露为异端并杀死他 对吧

3320
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:16,483
所以他们说的每一件事都是某种形式的陷阱

3321
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,716
有很多记者就是这样

3322
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:22,283
内莉·鲍尔斯为《纽约时报》撰写了一篇关于我的文章

3323
01:04:22,916 --> 01:04:30,300
这篇文章在很多方面是非常具有破坏性的 非常蜿蜒曲折和微妙

3324
01:04:31,616 --> 01:04:44,183
三年后 她写了另一篇文章 关于她在《纽约时报》工作时的经历 以及记者们 包括她自己 使用的伎俩

3325
01:04:44,383 --> 01:04:54,216
她说 这个游戏就是为了抬高你的名誉而破坏别人的名誉

3326
01:04:54,283 --> 01:04:57,566
你可以把它看作是一场相对道德地位的游戏

3327
01:04:58,066 --> 01:05:04,733
所以记者的诡计是诱使你说出一些会终结你职业生涯的话

3328
01:05:04,983 --> 01:05:07,016
他们的社会地位是建立在你的肩膀上的

3329
01:05:07,466 --> 01:05:08,683
绝对 绝对

3330
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:15,150
所以现在 处于这样的情况的优势是 你必须非常小心地迈出步伐

3331
01:05:15,766 --> 01:05:20,700
如果你足够小心且幸运

3332
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:26,433
那么你就会避开这些陷阱 然后采访就会大大倾向于你的有利

3333
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:39,766
因此 最终对我有益的访谈是两个最为敌对的访谈 一个是Channel 4的凯西·纽曼

3334
01:05:40,283 --> 01:05:41,000
凯西·纽曼

3335
01:05:41,016 --> 01:05:41,500
凯西·纽曼

3336
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:42,133
凯西·格里芬

3337
01:05:42,483 --> 01:05:44,933
至少凯西有幽默感

3338
01:05:45,383 --> 01:05:50,833
另一个是海伦·刘易斯的 她完全没有幽默感 而且在此期间似乎没有学到任何东西

3339
01:05:51,366 --> 01:05:56,950
但我认为那个访谈现在有8000万的观看量 是凯西·纽曼访谈的两倍

3340
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,316
就是不断增加观看量

3341
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:06,100
因为海伦·刘易斯 她有50种甚至是100种技巧

3342
01:06:06,183 --> 01:06:08,983
凯西大约有四种 而且相当直接

3343
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,233
她对此还有幽默感

3344
01:06:11,716 --> 01:06:15,350
但海伦·刘易斯 完全是技巧 而且很多 也很聪明

3345
01:06:15,883 --> 01:06:22,233
你知道 和一个聪明且受过良好教育但完全是技巧的人谈话是很有意思的

3346
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,550
但是 你知道

3347
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:26,116
回顾那两次访谈的感觉如何

3348
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:27,233
那是一段非常重要的成长时期

3349
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:30,866
这是你自己的一个转折点 或者说是其中一个转折点

3350
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:31,266
是的

3351
01:06:31,883 --> 01:06:33,183
回顾那段时间的感觉如何

3352
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:39,550
我记得你当时说 从那种争执不休的对抗性访谈中恢复过来需要很多天

3353
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:44,316
这看起来像是不同的一生吗 还是说这对你来说仍然很重要

3354
01:06:44,466 --> 01:06:46,350
好吧 我现在比那时健康多了

3355
01:06:46,866 --> 01:06:53,016
所以那些事情现在不会像那时对我产生同样的影响 因为我当时生病了

3356
01:06:53,116 --> 01:06:56,433
我花了很长时间从一次严重的病发中恢复过来

3357
01:06:56,483 --> 01:06:58,416
我第一次和山姆·哈里斯交谈时

3358
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:03,216
不是说山姆玩弄了什么技巧 我喜欢山姆 我们有过非常富有成效的对话

3359
01:07:04,266 --> 01:07:08,400
我第一次和山姆交谈时病得很重 几乎坐不稳

3360
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:11,266
和山姆·哈里斯交谈让你生病 这就是

3361
01:07:11,566 --> 01:07:15,883
不 不 绝对不是 不 不 山姆和我有过非常富有成效的对话

3362
01:07:15,916 --> 01:07:19,983
这是另一个关于对抗性对话有用的好例子

3363
01:07:21,116 --> 01:07:23,833
我的意思是 山姆以这样的方式来到对话

3364
01:07:24,316 --> 01:07:32,066
相当有准备 但这非常有帮助 因为它迫使你

3365
01:07:32,766 --> 01:07:39,250
去查看你可能没有查看过的角落 并且尽可能清晰地表达你实际上在说什么

3366
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:43,116
爱你的敌人的想法是我最近一直在思考的

3367
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:53,616
我的平台现在已经达到了一个水平 有理由让某人至少把瞄准镜指向我的方向

3368
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,666
因为试图打倒一个没有任何东西、没有任何地位的人是没有意义的

3369
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,066
你为什么要投入时间

3370
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,333
站在他们（无名者）的肩膀上 你将迈出的一步是如此之小 以至于没有人会注意到

3371
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:06,066
对 所以这是一种变相的恭维

3372
01:08:06,216 --> 01:08:07,116
是的 在某种程度上

3373
01:08:08,016 --> 01:08:08,800
但你说得对 伙计

3374
01:08:08,916 --> 01:08:11,066
我收到的一些批评

3375
01:08:11,366 --> 01:08:14,416
最近一个朋友提醒我这件事

3376
01:08:15,766 --> 01:08:21,583
已经到了一些最好的转折点 把它视为一份礼物可能并不令人舒服

3377
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:26,700
把那件事当作礼物来考虑 就像 我知道你这么做不是为了让我变得更好

3378
01:08:27,366 --> 01:08:34,683
我知道你这么做不是为了尝试给我带来好处 但在反思之后 这就像炼金术

3379
01:08:34,766 --> 01:08:37,633
这就像罗里·萨瑟兰称之为炼金术 把坏事变好

3380
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:39,083
我也有这样的反思

3381
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:47,366
是的 我们已经学到了 我的家人已经学到了 像当一次公共攻击发生时 其中隐藏着一个巨大的机会

3382
01:08:47,966 --> 01:08:57,016
如果你能重新定位 就像 好吧 这很糟糕 这很恶毒 这看起来不好 也许它能把我或我们搞垮

3383
01:08:58,116 --> 01:09:06,483
有没有一种方式 我们能用这种方式 不仅能中和它 还能以另一种方式扭转它

3384
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:16,633
我认为我们在这方面做得最有效的事情是当我被写进《美国队长》中作为--我在那天跟你说过--作为红骷髅

3385
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:18,033
我在发生那件事的那天跟你说过

3386
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,233
是的 哦是的

3387
01:09:19,316 --> 01:09:19,833
那个魔法-

3388
01:09:20,483 --> 01:09:21,350
魔法超级纳粹

3389
01:09:21,566 --> 01:09:22,400
飘浮的纳粹或者怎样

3390
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,283
是的 是的 是的

3391
01:09:23,383 --> 01:09:24,633
嗯 这是令人震惊的 对吧

3392
01:09:24,666 --> 01:09:26,183
这是非常令人震惊的

3393
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:27,283
然后奥利维亚·王尔德

3394
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:29,233
是的 那也很震惊

3395
01:09:29,516 --> 01:09:29,900
是的 是的

3396
01:09:30,316 --> 01:09:31,150
有一连串的令人震惊的事情

3397
01:09:31,183 --> 01:09:31,766
是的 是的

3398
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:38,066
它变得越来越荒谬 而奥利维亚·王尔德的那一集就是其中之一

3399
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,833
那实在是太荒谬了 几乎立刻就显得可笑

3400
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:50,900
我想值得庆幸的是 那部电影拍得太糟糕了 我很确定她让她的男朋友扮演其中一个角色 换掉了一个非常能干的人 换成了一个相当无能的人

3401
01:09:51,416 --> 01:09:53,400
我认为这导致了它的失败

3402
01:09:53,616 --> 01:10:00,750
但是 是的 伙计 那个敌人的事 我最终和我最严厉的批评者之一成了非常好的朋友 这真奇怪

3403
01:10:01,383 --> 01:10:03,833
然而事后完全讲得通

3404
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,600
你有一个-你是怎么结交朋友的

3405
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:17,416
所以我被一对播客批评了 他们做这个 他们有点拆解

3406
01:10:17,716 --> 01:10:21,483
或者他们对播客界的许多内容持非常批判的眼光

3407
01:10:21,766 --> 01:10:26,850
他们对我做的一集节目做了一期节目 并且他们有一个回应的权利

3408
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:27,233
哦 是的

3409
01:10:27,766 --> 01:10:29,050
萨姆上去做过

3410
01:10:29,816 --> 01:10:31,350
还有谁上去做过

3411
01:10:31,616 --> 01:10:34,116
我做过 还有其他几个 康斯坦丁·基森上去做过

3412
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:38,816
我上去之后 有点像 我听了他们的节目

3413
01:10:39,066 --> 01:10:45,250
我认为这是一个非常启发性的方式 看看有不同视角的人如何看待你的世界

3414
01:10:45,566 --> 01:10:49,633
我就像 是的 我有机会上去进行对话 我就这么做了

3415
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:54,833
我发现他们俩比我预想的要迷人得多

3416
01:10:55,383 --> 01:10:58,850
我和克里斯以及马特都成了朋友 虽然马特较少

3417
01:10:59,183 --> 01:11:04,700
但与克里斯 我们大概每月通话一次 每隔几周我们中的一个会打电话

3418
01:11:05,066 --> 01:11:08,950
我们会聊聊世界上发生的事情 他有一种非常不同的世界观

3419
01:11:09,183 --> 01:11:10,500
他住在世界的另一个地区

3420
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:20,116
他是一位研究宗教和神圣仪式的心理学家 我想 更确切地说是仪式而非宗教

3421
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:25,166
现在他指出了我看不见的盲点

3422
01:11:25,616 --> 01:11:34,966
而那个特别的例子是 这还是很不舒服 因为这是大约三年前的事情了

3423
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:37,916
我对此仍然感到非常不舒服

3424
01:11:37,966 --> 01:11:44,416
哦 我的天哪 这些人要把我怎么样 他们都是学者 受过很好的教育 他们会很聪明 他们会说出让我看起来傻的话

3425
01:11:44,516 --> 01:11:47,916
我说了一些让我看起来很傻的话 并被制作成了一个合集

3426
01:11:49,283 --> 01:11:53,866
然而在回顾中 那一次经历以及随后的深思

3427
01:11:54,366 --> 01:12:05,866
对我来说是从未意识到盲点到认识到这些盲点的最大转折点之一

3428
01:12:05,866 --> 01:12:16,033
我几乎认为 我经历的不适程度是必需的 因为如果我没有感到如此多的恐惧、焦虑和尴尬

3429
01:12:16,066 --> 01:12:22,966
关于这将会被公之于众 会有所有这种不友好的关注和注意 会有推文和所有这些东西

3430
01:12:22,983 --> 01:12:29,416
这种足够的不舒服迫使我真正地去看看我正在做错的事情

3431
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:31,500
我确信还有很多事情我还在做错

3432
01:12:32,066 --> 01:12:35,316
但是 是的 这和一个礼物一样宝贵

3433
01:12:35,616 --> 01:12:38,983
我们将在一分钟后回到和乔丹的对话 但首先我需要告诉你关于Element的事情

3434
01:12:39,166 --> 01:12:41,933
我每天早上已经连续使用Element超过三年了

3435
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,916
这是我每天开始的方式

3436
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,883
它味道很棒 优化了我的水化 帮助调节我的食欲 改善了我的大脑健康

3437
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:55,100
Element含有科学支持的电解质比例 包括钠、钾和镁

3438
01:12:55,283 --> 01:12:58,733
最棒的是 他们有一个全新的巧克力焦糖口味 可以热饮

3439
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:02,516
热Element 你说什么 这是什么水化亵渎行为

3440
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:06,616
但不 它味道很棒 在寒冷的早晨简直完美

3441
01:13:06,783 --> 01:13:16,250
他们有一个无废话 无问题问的退款政策 所以你可以完全无风险地购买和尝试 如果你因任何原因不喜欢 他们会退还你的钱 你甚至不需要退回盒子

3442
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:23,566
我每天早上都使用它 已经记不清从什么时候开始了 那个橙子口味非常棒 加上那个巧克力焦糖现在可以

3443
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:38,200
通过点击下方节目笔记中的链接或前往www.drinklmnt.com/modernwisdom获取你的第一盒免费的所有8种口味样品包 那是www.drinklmnt.com/modernwisdom

3444
01:13:38,216 --> 01:13:47,550
还有一件事 我去年和大卫·戈金斯谈过这个 关于我小时候被欺负 我在学校不太受欢迎 我是独生子

3445
01:13:48,816 --> 01:13:58,683
在学校操场上或其他地方 真的没有很多人支持我 很长一段时间我对那些在学校虐待我的孩子们怀有怨恨

3446
01:13:58,733 --> 01:14:07,333
你可能会预料到的 并且然后我可能在几年前真的开始反思它 并意识到

3447
01:14:07,383 --> 01:14:15,383
我在自己身上珍视的许多东西都是那段时间在学校期间形成的某种黑暗的光明面

3448
01:14:16,183 --> 01:14:24,450
所以我完全准备好独自一人花时间 不介意搬到一个我不认识任何人的国家

3449
01:14:25,116 --> 01:14:27,683
尝试让这个播客项目成功

3450
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:35,100
或者花几个小时工作、研究、录制播客、做介绍或任何类似的事情

3451
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:41,500
小时候没有一个非常紧密的社交网络意味着我不用对任何人负责

3452
01:14:42,166 --> 01:14:50,483
长大后 我觉得我不需要在做事情时获得太多支持

3453
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:54,566
现在 其他方面可能不那么好 因为我仍然寻求认可

3454
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:59,166
我仍然寻求很多认可 因为那是我小时候缺失的东西

3455
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:06,800
但是 是的 意识到不仅仅是你可能不会在这里 如果不是因为你经历的事情

3456
01:15:07,466 --> 01:15:08,333
好的 这是第一步

3457
01:15:09,116 --> 01:15:13,866
然后第二步是 我对自己所做的感到非常感激

3458
01:15:14,466 --> 01:15:16,183
然后第三步可能是

3459
01:15:16,566 --> 01:15:20,883
哇 我为自己能够将负面事物转变为正面事物感到骄傲

3460
01:15:21,766 --> 01:15:28,000
但是在那之上的另一个层次是 哇 所以也许我应该感激

3461
01:15:28,116 --> 01:15:28,750
是的 对

3462
01:15:29,166 --> 01:15:36,816
嗯 我们之前在播客中谈到了对未来应有的适当态度是什么

3463
01:15:37,566 --> 01:15:41,950
我会说 嗯 我们可以把过去、现在和未来放在同一个篮子里

3464
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:47,116
说 嗯 你想做的其中一件事就是练习感恩

3465
01:15:47,183 --> 01:15:51,766
那是你可能说的一种主要的宗教仪式 就是练习感恩

3466
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:56,583
你可能会说 嗯 我的生活如此糟糕 我有什么可以感激的

3467
01:15:57,216 --> 01:16:05,083
我会说 不论好坏 那仍然是一种盲目 对吧

3468
01:16:05,216 --> 01:16:10,100
我的意思是 人们可以处于非常非常困难的情况

3469
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:18,633
在那些困难的情况中 寻找感恩变成了一种必要的、更深入和更困难的事情

3470
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,766
但这并不意味着它不合适

3471
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:31,983
没有人--尽管你的生活中发生了可怕的事情 但爱你的敌人和感恩之间存在着非常紧密的联系

3472
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:39,033
我一直在写约伯记 约伯记本质上是一个不公正苦难的故事

3473
01:16:40,183 --> 01:16:46,933
上帝认为约伯是一个好人 所以上帝进行了言说 约伯实际上是一个好人 然后地狱里发生了躁动

3474
01:16:46,966 --> 01:16:52,866
部分原因是 上帝和撒旦打了一个赌 这是一件非常糟糕的事情 说 尽你最坏的去对待约伯

3475
01:16:52,866 --> 01:16:55,333
无论你做什么 他都不会背弃我

3476
01:16:56,116 --> 01:17:06,666
所以尽管受到折磨 约伯重病 失去了他拥有的一切 他的朋友们--他以一种毁容的方式生病--

3477
01:17:06,783 --> 01:17:13,116
他的朋友们来到他身边 嘲笑他 告诉他他是一个坏人 这就是为什么这些可怕的事情发生在他身上 这是残酷的

3478
01:17:13,816 --> 01:17:18,283
但约伯拒绝失去对自己的信念

3479
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:20,716
他说 看 我不完美

3480
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:25,683
但作为一个人 我做了我应该做的

3481
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:33,366
我并没有受到某种明显与我的罪有关的惩罚

3482
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:39,416
这更像是世界上悲剧力量的随机游戏

3483
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,066
无论发生什么 我都不会失去对自己的信念

3484
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:49,550
我也不会 （按照）妻子说的 对着上帝挥拳 诅咒他然后死去

3485
01:17:49,983 --> 01:17:53,566
因为约伯的境况变得如此糟糕 她认为这是他唯一剩下的选择

3486
01:17:53,616 --> 01:17:54,800
他拒绝这样做

3487
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:59,916
所以他无论发生什么都保持信念

3488
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:07,533
这真的是约伯记的寓意 那就是无论发生什么 你都有道德义务来保持信念

3489
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:09,983
这还有一个实际的方面

3490
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:15,450
所以想象一下 上帝和撒旦联手对付你

3491
01:18:15,516 --> 01:18:18,050
在你的生活中会有时候感觉就是这样

3492
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:24,366
然后想象一下你对此的反应是变得苦涩、怨恨和敌对

3493
01:18:24,983 --> 01:18:33,516
那么 在仅仅是由于悲剧事件的汇合的地狱外 你又在它下面打开了另一个完全不同的地狱

3494
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:41,550
那就是苦涩、怨恨和忘恩负义的地狱 而且 这很快就会转变为复仇的欲望

3495
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:44,866
你认为事情之所以糟糕仅仅是因为它们糟糕

3496
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:53,650
你等着瞧 如果你让自己被不公正的苦难腐蚀 事情会变得多么糟糕 对吧

3497
01:18:54,183 --> 01:19:06,116
因此 我确实认为这是可以给予人们的最实用的建议 那就是你有道德义务保持信念

3498
01:19:06,516 --> 01:19:12,466
向上追求 并以你希望别人如何对待你的方式对待他人 无论你经历了什么

3499
01:19:13,366 --> 01:19:14,850
你知道 这是一件很难做到的事情

3500
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:17,183
你可能会说 嗯 这是不可能的

3501
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,916
有些人的生活如此残酷 他们注定要腐败 但我会说这不是真的

3502
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:33,416
我遇到过很多人 特别是在我的临床实践中 他们的生活如此残酷 以至于你听到他们的故事 你会心碎、会震惊

3503
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:40,566
残酷 残酷的童年 你几乎无法想象的邪恶深度

3504
01:19:41,066 --> 01:19:47,833
尽管如此 他们将向上追求并将保持对自己和世界的信念

3505
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,266
所以这是人们可以选择的

3506
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:59,933
似乎是一个奇怪的悖论 那些在最有特权的生活下成长的人经常是那些对世界有最多抱怨的人

3507
01:19:59,966 --> 01:20:05,650
而那些在贫困中长大的人很多时候能够完全感恩

3508
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:07,766
似乎很奇怪 事情会是这样

3509
01:20:08,283 --> 01:20:11,033
是的 拥有...

3510
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:18,250
所以我在大学看到的一件事是 我看到了教职员工

3511
01:20:18,283 --> 01:20:28,483
我的同事们在行政部门的推进面前后退了三十年 以至于大学真的变得腐败了

3512
01:20:28,566 --> 01:20:32,383
在我1990年代在哈佛的时候 这并没有真正发生

3513
01:20:33,183 --> 01:20:39,616
尽管它开始在边缘稍微磨损 但我真正看到了它在我在多伦多大学的20年里发生

3514
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:47,033
行政部门不断对我们提出要求 每次他们提出要求 我们就屈服

3515
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:48,950
每次 1万次微小的退却

3516
01:20:50,116 --> 01:20:56,066
然后管理员接管了大学 然后所谓的“觉醒”类型的人接管了行政部门 就这样了

3517
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:01,850
嗯 我看到我的教职员工做的原因

3518
01:21:02,583 --> 01:21:06,616
我合作的学者们是这样开始腐败的

3519
01:21:06,716 --> 01:21:11,966
就像当你是一个本科生 你写下你认为教授想听的东西以获得成绩

3520
01:21:12,516 --> 01:21:19,366
然后你是研究生 你必须 比如说 与你的教授和导师相处融洽

3521
01:21:19,383 --> 01:21:23,650
你必须告诉他们你认为他们想听的东西 以便你可以获得你的博士学位

3522
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:28,500
然后也许你在学术道路上 你是一名助理教授

3523
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,100
做教授有三个等级

3524
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:31,566
你作为助理教授是没有终身职位的

3525
01:21:31,583 --> 01:21:38,133
所以你真的不能说出你的想法或做你认为应该做的事 因为你必须获得终身教职

3526
01:21:38,183 --> 01:21:41,033
然后当你获得终身教职时 嗯 你还不是正教授

3527
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:43,716
所以那时你不会发声

3528
01:21:43,883 --> 01:21:46,366
而在你的内心深处 你有这样一个想法

3529
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:53,150
嗯 某个时候我将拥有足够的安全感 以至于我能够说出真相

3530
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:59,133
但这基于一个奇怪的想法 那就是说出真相的勇气基于安全感

3531
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:02,116
嗯 勇气并不基于安全感

3532
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:03,650
那是一个愚蠢的理论

3533
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:06,033
没有风险 就没有勇气可言

3534
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:12,166
所以你的观点是 当没有任何风险时你才会勇敢

3535
01:22:12,666 --> 01:22:15,433
嗯 显然这在逻辑上是矛盾的

3536
01:22:15,783 --> 01:22:17,616
只有在有风险的情况下你才有勇敢可言

3537
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:29,116
不仅如此 当你为了虚幻的安全感牺牲你的话语权长达15年时 真实的你已经没有剩下什么了

3538
01:22:29,866 --> 01:22:31,700
那已经消失了

3539
01:22:31,766 --> 01:22:42,283
很久以前 你可能回顾过去的自己 那时你天真地认为你可以说出你的想法 只是 嗯 你对此感到愤世嫉俗

3540
01:22:42,766 --> 01:22:46,250
你知道 那个人只是不知道世界是怎样运作的

3541
01:22:46,516 --> 01:22:49,233
然后这和你指出的是同一个问题

3542
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:59,750
认为你因为拥有物质富足而变得善良 那是一个愚蠢的想法

3543
01:23:00,383 --> 01:23:01,533
为什么会是这样

3544
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,950
就像假设所有富人都有品味一样

3545
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:05,583
对 对

3546
01:23:05,883 --> 01:23:12,500
贫穷的人可能拥有设计精美的内饰 而富人可能拥有俗气的混乱

3547
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:14,183
对 对 对 对

3548
01:23:14,416 --> 01:23:14,716
有一个-

3549
01:23:15,266 --> 01:23:16,550
是的 那么穷人其实是富有的

3550
01:23:17,916 --> 01:23:18,383
绝对是

3551
01:23:18,983 --> 01:23:22,116
有一个报告 我想把这个带给你 太有趣了

3552
01:23:22,466 --> 01:23:29,533
哈佛大学教育研究生院最近发布了一份报告 详细说明了18至25岁年轻成年人焦虑的驱动因素

3553
01:23:31,966 --> 01:23:38,366
34%的人报告感到孤独 51%的人说成就压力对他们的心理健康产生了负面影响

3554
01:23:39,683 --> 01:23:43,450
58%的人报告在过去一个月里感到缺乏生活的意义或目的

3555
01:23:44,216 --> 01:23:49,383
50%的人报告他们的心理健康因为不知道如何安排自己的生活而受到负面影响

3556
01:23:49,783 --> 01:23:52,883
对14至17岁青少年的福祉进行了大量研究

3557
01:23:54,066 --> 01:23:58,150
但对于处于关键的年轻成年期的人来说 了解不多

3558
01:23:58,350 --> 01:24:06,766
然而 年轻成年人报告的焦虑和抑郁率大约是青少年的两倍 年轻成年人并不好

3559
01:24:08,616 --> 01:24:09,400
是的 我相信这一点

3560
01:24:10,066 --> 01:24:22,316
我甚至从我自己的孩子那里看到 像我小时候 大概13到15岁之间是最困难的过渡期 但我看到这个年龄段变得更晚了

3561
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:25,850
到我孩子们现在基本上30岁的时候

3562
01:24:26,783 --> 01:24:34,916
到我孩子们成为年轻成年人的时候 我可以看到那个进入成年期的过渡是困难开始增加的地方

3563
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:47,366
我认为 反常地 治疗界在这方面有相当大的责任 部分原因是治疗师

3564
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:54,616
他们基本上是世俗的自由派新教徒 这是一个好的思考方式

3565
01:24:55,300 --> 01:25:00,166
倾向于将心理健康概念化为主观的 对吧

3566
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:04,833
就是说心理健康是你在头脑中携带的东西 就像你携带你的身份一样

3567
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:09,133
这就是为什么我们有这些荒谬的想法 你可以自己定义你的身份

3568
01:25:09,516 --> 01:25:10,983
我就是我所说的那个人

3569
01:25:11,316 --> 01:25:13,433
显然你不是 因为其他人

3570
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:19,800
其他人必须配合你的游戏 伙计 他们要么就这么做 要么不做

3571
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:24,083
或者他们会自愿地做 或者他们会被迫做

3572
01:25:24,766 --> 01:25:26,516
如果他们不做 你就完了

3573
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:29,016
如果你必须使用强制 那是行不通的

3574
01:25:29,466 --> 01:25:34,183
如果你希望他们自愿做 那显然不会全是关于你的

3575
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:41,000
如果他总是想挑选游戏 那么即使是四岁的孩子也找不到人一起玩

3576
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:46,500
那么 为什么年轻成年人可能会迷失呢

3577
01:25:46,666 --> 01:25:54,133
部分原因是他们认为 我不是想对整整一代人进行评判

3578
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,216
这是一种思维方式

3579
01:25:58,366 --> 01:26:00,633
你的心理健康不取决于你自己

3580
01:26:02,416 --> 01:26:03,900
这不是正确的思考方式

3581
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:11,233
我认为 在没有长期稳定关系的情况下 你无法拥有心理健康

3582
01:26:12,150 --> 01:26:13,433
所以你必须结婚

3583
01:26:14,683 --> 01:26:20,050
让这成为年轻成年人成功适应的前提条件之一

3584
01:26:20,316 --> 01:26:21,116
你必须结婚

3585
01:26:22,083 --> 01:26:26,883
所以你必须与一个能够持存长期的性关系的人建立关系

3586
01:26:27,566 --> 01:26:31,000
因为长期在一起就等同于理智

3587
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:37,900
为了明天 在那里 为了下一分钟 在那里 那不是理智 那是冲动

3588
01:26:38,616 --> 01:26:41,183
那是目标不明 它们是一回事

3589
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:52,383
如果一切都关于你现在想要的 或者更准确地说 全部关于你内在某些东西此刻想要的 那就是不成熟的疯狂的定义

3590
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:58,666
你必须承诺 所以你承诺给别人 你承诺给你的家庭 你承诺给你的社区

3591
01:26:59,166 --> 01:27:02,916
社会世界中存在多个层次的身份

3592
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:10,633
自愿承担那些层级的层次化责任 会给你一个身份

3593
01:27:11,016 --> 01:27:13,850
它给你一个目的 它保护你免受焦虑

3594
01:27:13,883 --> 01:27:15,166
它通过各种方式做到这一点

3595
01:27:16,316 --> 01:27:23,650
你之前说过 你所做的事情之一是寻求认可 你将其与你很小的时候经历的不舒服的经历联系起来

3596
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,416
好吧 可能不完全是你在寻求认可

3597
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:37,850
你可能是在恰当地探索如何在每一个可能的层次上嵌入社会层级中

3598
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:43,116
就像 嗯 人们认为他们的心理健康是他们只是在头脑中携带的东西

3599
01:27:43,466 --> 01:27:50,483
如果他们只是正确地看待世界 或者如果其他人只是玩他们的游戏 突然间他们就会心理健康

3600
01:27:50,566 --> 01:27:56,800
就像 过度地思考自己与感到痛苦之间没有区别

3601
01:27:57,883 --> 01:28:09,333
从技术上讲 如果你看看 你可以对关于你自己的描述性陈述进行统计分组

3602
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:20,183
所有的描述性陈述 所有反映自我意识的描述符都与负面情绪有关

3603
01:28:20,733 --> 01:28:21,100
我们知道这一点

3604
01:28:21,416 --> 01:28:22,616
你不能以积极的方式思考自己吗

3605
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:25,366
可能不行

3606
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:26,466
真的吗

3607
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:27,150
不能

3608
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:30,683
好吧 让我们来分析一下

3609
01:28:32,816 --> 01:28:35,150
你喜欢做你的播客 并且对此感到积极

3610
01:28:35,483 --> 01:28:37,533
好吧 但你的播客不是关于你 对吧

3611
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:45,833
所以如果你在思考你对广大人群有何用处

3612
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:52,133
你知道 也许你会因此感到满意 但那并不完全是在思考自己

3613
01:28:52,450 --> 01:28:57,366
这是在思考你与其他人建立的关系 这是一种责任关系

3614
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,166
你为什么喜欢你的播客

3615
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:03,800
你可以追求你感到好奇的东西 但你不必公开这么做

3616
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,966
好吧 那你为什么要公开做呢

3617
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:08,883
有几个原因

3618
01:29:09,166 --> 01:29:11,783
首先是它让我保持负责任

3619
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:19,083
这是主要原因之一 它让我保持负责任 因为我知道如果我不这么做 如果我不严谨和准确

3620
01:29:19,816 --> 01:29:26,700
不与我之前说过的和做过的保持一致 就会有一个外部的眼睛在观察

3621
01:29:27,183 --> 01:29:30,000
好吧 好吧 好吧 这非常有趣

3622
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:33,333
所以我也会说 这并不完全是关于你

3623
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:41,033
这是关于你的能力 建立你所说的话和你的行为方式之间的和谐

3624
01:29:41,516 --> 01:29:48,300
以及越来越广泛的社会群体对你的看法 作为你所说的话和你的行为方式的后果

3625
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,133
好吧 这不是关于你

3626
01:29:50,650 --> 01:29:54,683
这是关于你在社会层级中的定位 对吧

3627
01:29:54,766 --> 01:30:03,200
所以我认为你可以 然后你可能还会说 嗯 也许当你在设立一个目标或目的时 你在思考自己

3628
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:08,833
好吧 如果它们是好的目标或目的 那就不是了 因为如果它们是好的目标或目的

3629
01:30:10,033 --> 01:30:25,933
我会说 从技术上讲 好的意思是一个在中长期内能够很好地展开 在多种情况下 包括许多人

3630
01:30:26,416 --> 01:30:41,316
所以一个能够随时间迭代 并且与情境无关 并且广泛的社会包容的解决方案 是一个更好的目标 对吧

3631
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:43,183
这是一个更高的目标 因为它整合了更多

3632
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:51,583
好的 现在 你可能想要设立目标 并且你可能对你在实现这些目标方面的进展感到满意

3633
01:30:51,683 --> 01:30:57,783
但如果那些目标没有我刚才描述的特征 那么

3634
01:31:01,566 --> 01:31:05,416
如果目标具有我刚才描述的特征 它们就不是只关于你的

3635
01:31:05,916 --> 01:31:07,900
然后我们还可以问 你说的关于你是什么意思

3636
01:31:08,983 --> 01:31:11,550
确切地说 你在这里谈论的你是什么

3637
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:18,933
你知道 在现代世界 我们玩这些身份游戏 这让人们感到焦虑和无望

3638
01:31:19,450 --> 01:31:23,566
其中一个身份游戏是 我被我的性取向定义

3639
01:31:23,983 --> 01:31:26,533
好吧 让我们来看看 我被我的性取向定义

3640
01:31:26,616 --> 01:31:29,050
好吧 但“你的性取向”确切地指的是什么

3641
01:31:30,016 --> 01:31:33,766
你是指从事性行为的机会吗

3642
01:31:34,216 --> 01:31:37,966
像是你将性本身简化为性行为吗

3643
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:39,566
好吧 假设你是这样的

3644
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:45,033
所以现在你告诉我的是 你是在你性欲旺盛时的你

3645
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:48,050
你把自己简化到了这个程度 但实际上还不止这些

3646
01:31:48,666 --> 01:31:52,716
这是一种性欲 希望立刻得到满足

3647
01:31:53,616 --> 01:31:55,400
而完全没有任何关系

3648
01:31:55,483 --> 01:32:04,850
所以不仅你现在将你自己简化为你的性欲 你还将你的性欲简化为满足它的最小先决条件集合

3649
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:07,066
那么 首先可能出现的问题是

3650
01:32:07,383 --> 01:32:08,600
为什么不直接使用色情呢

3651
01:32:09,350 --> 01:32:10,216
这样简单得多

3652
01:32:10,516 --> 01:32:12,966
答案是 人们就是这么做的

3653
01:32:13,283 --> 01:32:20,666
难怪他们感到焦虑、孤独和没有目标 因为他们将自己简化为了短期欲望

3654
01:32:20,783 --> 01:32:23,066
他们找到了满足这种欲望的最简单方法 他们放弃了一切

3655
01:32:23,466 --> 01:32:34,950
而如果性欲被正确地融入到 嗯 首先是一段关系中 那会是一个更广泛的概念

3656
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:39,333
这些不只是意见

3657
01:32:40,283 --> 01:32:47,900
所以在动物世界中大致有两种不同的繁殖策略

3658
01:32:48,583 --> 01:32:51,716
一种是零投资

3659
01:32:52,916 --> 01:32:58,583
鱼类、蚊子 产生百万后代 它们都死了但有至少有一个存活 对吧

3660
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:02,183
所以你可以基本上将蚊子的繁殖简化为性行为

3661
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:09,016
你制造一百万蚊子后代 只需要一个存活 问题解决 好的

3662
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:12,166
在光谱的另一端 字面上的 是人类

3663
01:33:13,066 --> 01:33:17,250
因为我们是所有动物中依赖期最长的 远远超出其他动物

3664
01:33:17,766 --> 01:33:21,600
我们采用了高投资策略的性繁殖策略

3665
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,633
所以无论对人类来说性是什么 它不是--你完成了那就结束了

3666
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:28,400
这不是人类的情况

3667
01:33:28,466 --> 01:33:29,833
它嵌入在一种关系中

3668
01:33:30,283 --> 01:33:37,750
现在你可能会说 嗯 我们可以将性从关系中抽离出来 只是为了享受快感而沉溺其中

3669
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,166
好的 那么现在让我们忘记所有其他动物

3670
01:33:40,283 --> 01:33:42,383
现在我们有了两种类型的人类

3671
01:33:42,416 --> 01:33:46,500
我们有一夜情的人类 重复的一夜情

3672
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,416
我们有长期承诺关系的人类

3673
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:55,633
然后我们可能会问 好的 这两种情况的人有什么性格特征

3674
01:33:56,383 --> 01:34:01,550
所以让我们来看看短期的一夜情连续关系类型

3675
01:34:02,116 --> 01:34:03,050
好的 他们是谁

3676
01:34:04,283 --> 01:34:08,916
精神病态的 自恋的 马基雅维利主义的 和虐待狂的

3677
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:10,783
所有一夜情的人都这样吗

3678
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:16,316
如果他们一开始不是这样 他们最终会变成这样

3679
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:21,883
对 因为你不能为了短期满足而使用自己或他人

3680
01:34:23,266 --> 01:34:27,800
精神病态的定义是某人为了短期满足而利用别人

3681
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:30,933
好吧 所以这是定义上的 对吧

3682
01:34:31,566 --> 01:34:34,166
然后你可能会说 嗯 我不是那样的 我只是喜欢性

3683
01:34:34,350 --> 01:34:41,766
就像 是的 但如果你练习这个五年 你不会成为你所练习的东西吗

3684
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:46,800
我和拉塞尔·布兰德稍微谈过这个问题

3685
01:34:49,066 --> 01:34:54,333
我可以说这个 因为这是在他的播客上的 所以这不是秘密 你知道的

3686
01:34:55,166 --> 01:34:58,000
拉塞尔拥有了安德鲁·泰特向他的追随者承诺的东西

3687
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:07,083
他有名气 他很有魅力 而且他或多或少地拥有了无限制的短期性满足的机会

3688
01:35:07,716 --> 01:35:15,650
好的 结合了让这种可能性更大的化学物质 比如说酒精和可卡因

3689
01:35:19,283 --> 01:35:20,366
那么后果是什么

3690
01:35:20,816 --> 01:35:22,350
好吧 我问他 后果是什么

3691
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:22,866
你经历了这一切

3692
01:35:23,283 --> 01:35:26,333
他说 绝望、焦虑和无望

3693
01:35:27,483 --> 01:35:34,550
对 但不仅如此 因为拉塞尔一个半月前陷入了麻烦 差点儿就让他垮掉了

3694
01:35:35,366 --> 01:35:37,350
嗯 是他的“过去”回来困扰他

3695
01:35:37,466 --> 01:35:45,533
就像 他不得不翻阅他的心灵 并看到 你知道 有了所有这些短期关系

3696
01:35:47,216 --> 01:35:54,050
这些我沉溺于短期性满足的狂欢 我是否曾经越界了

3697
01:35:54,316 --> 01:35:59,250
好吧 答案是 嗯 你要有200次这样的遭遇

3698
01:35:59,316 --> 01:36:07,183
当你喝醉了 当你吸食了可卡因 你会越过一堆界限 然后这些会回来困扰你

3699
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:24,683
所以 看到我们的文化回到了你提到的 表征年轻成年人生活的绝望和无望 这非常有趣

3700
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:27,616
就像 嗯 这一切都关于“我”

3701
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,433
那是自尊运动

3702
01:36:29,466 --> 01:36:31,750
但然后我变成了 这一切都关于我想要的

3703
01:36:31,983 --> 01:36:34,683
然后变成了 这一切都关于我现在想要的

3704
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:40,250
然后是我内心最低级的部分现在想要的 其他人都去死

3705
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:45,650
就像 好吧 你怎么能在不绝望的情况下玩这个游戏

3706
01:36:46,166 --> 01:36:48,283
一旦你开始玩这个游戏 就会变得绝望

3707
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:55,966
而且更糟的是 你最终会遇到杰瑞米 色情明星的问题

3708
01:36:56,783 --> 01:37:01,600
任何人 你不会对与你一起玩这个游戏的人感到很高兴

3709
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:06,766
因为他们不会是那些真正让你感觉生活值得的人

3710
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:10,483
他们会是那些人 尤其是女性方面

3711
01:37:12,183 --> 01:37:15,966
那些愿意为了短期性满足而利用自己的女性

3712
01:37:16,550 --> 01:37:17,533
那些不是快乐的女性

3713
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,266
她们通常是受伤的女性

3714
01:37:21,350 --> 01:37:26,233
如果她们开始玩这个游戏时不受伤 那么当她们结束这个游戏时 她们肯定会受到很多伤害

3715
01:37:26,866 --> 01:37:29,916
我们上次谈话时 我和你讨论了人口下降

3716
01:37:30,766 --> 01:37:38,483
人口普查局今天刚发布预测 预计美国人口将在2100年首次出现下降 在2080年达到峰值后

3717
01:37:40,150 --> 01:37:45,833
他们的估计显示 目前约有3.33亿的美国人口预计到2080年将达到3.7亿

3718
01:37:47,916 --> 01:37:55,183
但到2100年将下降到3.66亿 即使是移民也无法抵消这种出生率的下降

3719
01:37:57,083 --> 01:38:05,116
过去两年来 你认为从出生率和婚姻率的角度来看 情况变得更好还是更糟

3720
01:38:05,183 --> 01:38:06,933
我认为它们可能还在恶化

3721
01:38:09,766 --> 01:38:16,600
我认为埃隆·马斯克是少数几个人之一 以防有人好奇

3722
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:26,783
他是少数几个呼吁一孩政策的危险或我们应该减少人口的观点的人之一

3723
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:35,766
我的意思是 不增长的东西会死亡 但它们会因为各种原因死亡 我们可以将这与身份联系起来

3724
01:38:36,883 --> 01:38:38,150
你知道 我的身份是什么

3725
01:38:38,566 --> 01:38:40,316
我可以说 嗯 这是我对自己的感觉

3726
01:38:40,716 --> 01:38:42,483
这是现在到处都在使用的说法

3727
01:38:43,183 --> 01:38:44,900
你不能告诉我我是谁

3728
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:48,633
我知道我是谁 我是我感觉自己是谁

3729
01:38:48,850 --> 01:38:50,733
首先 我甚至不知道你所说的“感觉”是什么意思

3730
01:38:50,950 --> 01:38:51,516
像 这是什么鬼

3731
01:38:51,866 --> 01:38:52,716
这是什么意思

3732
01:38:53,416 --> 01:38:58,683
你是你此刻的情绪状态 你可以把它强加给每个人

3733
01:38:58,766 --> 01:38:59,783
这是你的理论 是吗

3734
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:02,200
这是两岁小孩的理论 字面上的

3735
01:39:02,616 --> 01:39:03,900
这是一个非常糟糕的理论

3736
01:39:04,850 --> 01:39:05,000
嗯

3737
01:39:09,383 --> 01:39:11,533
除了那个 你的身份还可能是什么

3738
01:39:11,666 --> 01:39:21,650
嗯 我在哈佛教书时的一个身份显然是教授 这是一个很好的身份 但那不完全是 它不是我在头脑中携带的东西

3739
01:39:22,366 --> 01:39:26,650
它是我与许多人 所有我的学生 建立的一种关系模式

3740
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:29,133
它不在我的头脑里

3741
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:37,483
现在 我的自我表征和我在世界上的行为之间有一致性 这种一致性就是健康

3742
01:39:38,350 --> 01:39:40,000
它不是我对自己的想法

3743
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:45,850
部分原因是你可以从某些方面获得满足

3744
01:39:46,466 --> 01:39:47,766
我们称之为满足感

3745
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:53,683
成为一个成功的播客 是因为你实际上是一个成功的播客

3746
01:39:53,966 --> 01:39:55,033
这不在你的头脑里

3747
01:39:56,066 --> 01:39:58,300
这在150万订阅者中

3748
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:59,850
你做了多少个播客

3749
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,833
700个

3750
01:40:00,850 --> 01:40:01,950
好 那就是700个播客

3751
01:40:02,716 --> 01:40:04,966
这不是你在头脑中携带的东西

3752
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:11,583
你还记得 我喜欢那42条规则 它们创造了你最终提出的24条 但有一条你没有使用

3753
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:18,000
如果你必须做出选择 那么成为一个真正做事的人 而不是那种只为被看见而做事的人

3754
01:40:18,050 --> 01:40:19,083
确切地 绝对是

3755
01:40:19,183 --> 01:40:20,033
我喜欢那条规则

3756
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:21,383
哦是的 那是一条很好的规则

3757
01:40:21,883 --> 01:40:22,683
那是一条很棒的规则

3758
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:29,633
是的 问题是你几乎可以做任何你想做的事 如果你愿意为此承担责任 如果你不想要功劳

3759
01:40:29,716 --> 01:40:35,650
我见过的最有效的政治策略之一 是一个女人 她是如此聪明

3760
01:40:35,716 --> 01:40:37,583
我不会告诉你她是谁 但她非常敏锐

3761
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:38,466
她是如此的聪明

3762
01:40:38,816 --> 01:40:40,383
她上次告诉我

3763
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:42,816
她已经参与了大约30年

3764
01:40:43,650 --> 01:40:45,400
出现在你意想不到的地方

3765
01:40:45,566 --> 01:40:48,350
我问她 这是怎么做到的

3766
01:40:48,416 --> 01:40:53,683
她说 哦 我30年前就决定了 如果我不想要功劳 我可以做任何我想做的事

3767
01:40:54,666 --> 01:40:56,183
所以她就是这么做的

3768
01:40:56,650 --> 01:40:59,483
她拥有了非凡的职业生涯 非凡的

3769
01:41:00,050 --> 01:41:02,116
我也和其他做同样事情的人合作过

3770
01:41:02,416 --> 01:41:03,400
这非常有趣

3771
01:41:03,950 --> 01:41:05,866
意识到这一点是非常有趣的事情

3772
01:41:06,350 --> 01:41:09,400
你可能会说 为什么我要在没有荣耀的情况下承担责任

3773
01:41:09,516 --> 01:41:10,966
就像 嘿 你想要荣耀吗

3774
01:41:11,150 --> 01:41:13,300
你真的确定那不会妨碍你吗

3775
01:41:14,166 --> 01:41:16,083
你知道 有一些事情需要匿名

3776
01:41:16,516 --> 01:41:20,083
其次 也许你想要责任 因为这就是冒险

3777
01:41:20,350 --> 01:41:24,333
你实际上可以做那些 别人只是想获得功劳的事情

3778
01:41:24,766 --> 01:41:31,333
好吧 也许做这件事本身就对身份来说是一种足够的奖励

3779
01:41:32,683 --> 01:41:37,300
你知道 当我是教授时 我也是丈夫 也是父亲

3780
01:41:37,666 --> 01:41:40,450
那些是身份 但它们不在我的头脑中

3781
01:41:41,216 --> 01:41:44,966
它们嵌入在我与孩子们的关系中 那是一段有意义的关系

3782
01:41:45,083 --> 01:41:46,916
嵌入在我与妻子的关系中

3783
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:52,233
你知道 这在现代世界几乎是异端邪说

3784
01:41:54,250 --> 01:42:05,983
你不能孤立无援 没有责任 追求你的享乐主义废话 而不疯狂和痛苦

3785
01:42:06,583 --> 01:42:09,566
这些都是一回事

3786
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:17,716
因此 你知道 事情已经发展到这个地步 我说过一些让我有些不受欢迎的话 比如人们在有孩子之前很难成熟

3787
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:27,216
你在那段关系中发现了自己的很大一部分

3788
01:42:27,416 --> 01:42:29,366
它让你负起责任 让你成长

3789
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:31,200
它给你机会指导别人

3790
01:42:31,950 --> 01:42:33,800
你身边有比你更重要的人

3791
01:42:34,566 --> 01:42:36,233
嗯 那是精神健康的一部分

3792
01:42:37,083 --> 01:42:38,166
这是很大的一部分

3793
01:42:39,183 --> 01:42:43,233
这是我在伦敦组织的这个企业 帮助组织的

3794
01:42:43,883 --> 01:42:48,116
“负责公民联盟” 我们试图提出一个治理模型

3795
01:42:49,416 --> 01:42:57,683
它被称为辅助模型 想法是人们有多重社会角色 这些角色是有层次的

3796
01:42:58,450 --> 01:43:07,033
你照顾好自己 整合自己 意味着你可以在中长期内适当地行事 你是自给自足的

3797
01:43:07,550 --> 01:43:09,933
然后你也许可以将这扩展到你的伴侣

3798
01:43:10,383 --> 01:43:19,633
然后到你的家庭 再到你的本地社区 然后随着你变得越来越有能力和能够承担那些责任 到更广阔的社区

3799
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:23,950
这是孤立的享乐主义奴役的替代品

3800
01:43:24,566 --> 01:43:31,000
你是你自己奇思妙想的奴隶 这是暴政的替代品 因为如果你承担了所有那些责任

3801
01:43:31,483 --> 01:43:33,533
你就不需要别人来治理你

3802
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:41,400
这又是一个例子 展示了我有点怪罪于治疗师

3803
01:43:41,483 --> 01:43:45,250
我称他们为自由派新教世俗主义者

3804
01:43:46,083 --> 01:43:55,250
这是因为他们将心灵的所在视为内在的、主观的

3805
01:43:55,366 --> 01:43:56,350
这是自由派会做的事情

3806
01:43:57,100 --> 01:43:58,650
这并不准确

3807
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:01,816
那不是心灵的工作方式

3808
01:44:02,266 --> 01:44:05,250
它不在你的脑袋里 你知道

3809
01:44:05,483 --> 01:44:17,216
它在你的脑袋和世界中 同时 你的理智确实是你作为个体和世界之间的一致性

3810
01:44:17,683 --> 01:44:18,633
那是理智

3811
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:25,466
它不是你的心灵或大脑在你头骨里的适当结构

3812
01:44:26,050 --> 01:44:27,616
你分布在世界中

3813
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:29,150
你应该如此

3814
01:44:29,350 --> 01:44:30,733
那是 你想要如此

3815
01:44:31,366 --> 01:44:32,433
那里有冒险

3816
01:44:32,916 --> 01:44:34,150
你想成为唯我论者吗

3817
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:37,216
一个唯我论的色情自慰者

3818
01:44:37,816 --> 01:44:40,383
天哪 难怪你感到茫然和痛苦

3819
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:42,850
嗯 天哪 这是如此可悲

3820
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:44,783
我为什么这么不开心

3821
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,550
这是因为你在想你自己

3822
01:44:47,383 --> 01:44:52,750
不 你一直在想自己最低级的冲动

3823
01:44:53,383 --> 01:44:54,216
这就是为什么你痛苦

3824
01:44:55,616 --> 01:45:01,700
在Arc时 我认为特别有趣的是你们晚上在O2举办的现场活动

3825
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:08,816
每个人都很棒 但我认为那天晚上道格拉斯简直是力量的展现

3826
01:45:09,383 --> 01:45:12,133
和道格拉斯成为朋友以来 你学到了什么

3827
01:45:12,183 --> 01:45:14,116
他对你有什么影响或影响了你吗

3828
01:45:16,066 --> 01:45:19,516
嗯 道格拉斯非常非常不易相处

3829
01:45:20,983 --> 01:45:24,300
你知道 他喜欢战斗

3830
01:45:25,266 --> 01:45:29,550
而那不是我会做的事 我一点都不喜欢战斗

3831
01:45:30,616 --> 01:45:33,300
部分原因是这有点反常 我猜

3832
01:45:34,016 --> 01:45:43,950
在某些方面 我愿意参与困难对话的原因是因为我不想永远进行它们

3833
01:45:45,350 --> 01:45:47,633
因此 你知道 我在我的婚姻中有一个规则

3834
01:45:48,383 --> 01:45:55,683
这是一个我妻子也乐意遵循的规则 那就是如果我们有问题 我们现在就要处理

3835
01:45:56,266 --> 01:45:58,400
我们要彻底处理它

3836
01:45:59,516 --> 01:46:01,533
这非常不愉快

3837
01:46:01,766 --> 01:46:10,316
但如果你这么做 有时你只需要做一次 问题就消失了 然后你就不会每天为余生都有那个该死的问题

3838
01:46:10,950 --> 01:46:16,716
有时需要20次才能解决问题 才能彻底解决问题

3839
01:46:17,550 --> 01:46:19,116
这可能非常不愉快

3840
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:26,650
道格拉斯非常擅长不让人轻易脱钩

3841
01:46:27,583 --> 01:46:28,316
他非常坚韧

3842
01:46:28,866 --> 01:46:31,000
而且他非常善于自我防御

3843
01:46:31,650 --> 01:46:38,433
他身上有一种无情 非常令人钦佩

3844
01:46:38,683 --> 01:46:41,533
这是一种明智的无情 你知道的

3845
01:46:41,683 --> 01:46:47,300
这是一场危险的游戏 因为还有另一个福音的领悟 比方说

3846
01:46:47,783 --> 01:46:53,366
你用来评判他人的标准将是用来评判你自己的标准

3847
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:55,183
原因是 嗯

3848
01:46:55,750 --> 01:47:00,350
你怎么能评判所有其他人而不对自己应用相同的标准呢

3849
01:47:01,066 --> 01:47:05,800
这是不可能的 因为你会变成你所练习的 你会转向自己

3850
01:47:06,116 --> 01:47:09,833
那种敌意的目光 你对别人使用的 你绝对会转向自己

3851
01:47:10,416 --> 01:47:11,383
这是无法避免的

3852
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:15,500
因此 道格拉斯玩的是一场危险的游戏 因为他非常好斗

3853
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:18,233
但他也极其小心

3854
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:19,816
他对词语非常小心

3855
01:47:20,316 --> 01:47:23,600
我们一起在欧洲巡演

3856
01:47:24,450 --> 01:47:25,833
我认为我们一起做了九场演出

3857
01:47:26,366 --> 01:47:27,350
我们分担了问答环节

3858
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:31,383
他在我的讲座前做了一点介绍

3859
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:33,650
我真的很喜欢 我认为那很棒

3860
01:47:34,050 --> 01:47:35,533
能认识他是我的荣幸

3861
01:47:35,983 --> 01:47:40,750
非常聪明 非常有文化的人 非常机智

3862
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:48,450
所以他有很棒的幽默感 这也很有趣 这也是让他成为辩论中非常危险对手的原因之一

3863
01:47:48,950 --> 01:47:52,533
因为他不仅仅掌握着事实

3864
01:47:53,483 --> 01:47:59,300
像比约恩·隆堡那样 但他又极具机智和锋利 看他那样真是乐趣无穷

3865
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:00,650
他在这方面是个大师

3866
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:10,833
这让人觉得很有趣 想到你真正需要的 在现场辩论中 我想很久以前我就从你和萨姆那里学到了这一点

3867
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:23,983
如果你在一场没有正式知识形式开场白等的现场辩论中 能够设法获得两三个真正的精彩点 无论内容如何 你都赢了

3868
01:48:24,216 --> 01:48:28,150
如果你能够做到两三个真正的精彩点 全场大笑

3869
01:48:28,883 --> 01:48:34,466
猜猜怎么着 你就成功了-是的 伟大的公共知识分子都有着尖锐的幽默感 对吧

3870
01:48:34,783 --> 01:48:38,916
我认为 这也是为什么许多成功的播客主持人都是喜剧演员的原因

3871
01:48:39,583 --> 01:48:47,200
在ARC大会上 我认为康斯坦丁·基森的演讲是大会上的绝对亮点

3872
01:48:47,950 --> 01:48:54,900
我认为截至今日 它在ARK侧面获得了600,000次观看 在他自己的频道上大约600次

3873
01:48:55,316 --> 01:49:01,300
康斯坦丁完美地将知识内容与机智融合在一起

3874
01:49:01,683 --> 01:49:05,983
嗯 关于我即将开始的现场巡演 有趣的事情是

3875
01:49:06,366 --> 01:49:13,916
我的一些喜剧演员朋友对我说 伙计 我真的很羡慕你能做的巡演 因为没人期待你会很有趣

3876
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:18,283
（所以）如果你在90分钟内设法让人笑四次 你就大获全胜

3877
01:49:18,683 --> 01:49:22,250
（而）如果我每七秒钟不搞笑一次 我就是个糟糕的喜剧演员

3878
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:31,116
所以标准已经设定 显然 以康斯坦丁的喜剧背景而言 这意味着他能够远远比大多数公共演讲者更有趣

3879
01:49:32,183 --> 01:49:34,233
远远超出了大多数人

3880
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:41,016
但并不总是被期望整时间都说俏皮话

3881
01:49:41,416 --> 01:49:51,500
道格拉斯在你们在台上谈话时提出的一点我觉得特别有趣 那就是聪明人被文化战争的废话俘获的危险

3882
01:49:52,383 --> 01:50:00,966
你是否曾经思考 过去十年里 地球上一些最聪明的人将他们的注意力、他们的认知能力

3883
01:50:01,366 --> 01:50:08,900
只是浪费在争论男人是男人、女人是女人 或者其他当下的观念上

3884
01:50:09,550 --> 01:50:11,116
就这样 多少时间被浪费了

3885
01:50:11,166 --> 01:50:17,300
所以我已经与《每日电线》合作了大约一年半 到目前为止非常成功

3886
01:50:17,666 --> 01:50:18,816
与他们合作非常愉快

3887
01:50:19,366 --> 01:50:24,133
但他们不断地在努力应对的是 所有人 所有的原则

3888
01:50:24,850 --> 01:50:33,616
《每日电线》的所有原则都宁愿在某种真实的意义上专注于哲学、神学或戏剧性的问题

3889
01:50:34,466 --> 01:50:40,383
所以这部分原因是为什么《每日电线》正转向为儿童 但也为成人提供娱乐

3890
01:50:40,683 --> 01:50:42,866
开始制作电影 例如 和电视节目

3891
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,300
他们更愿意做那样的事

3892
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:55,533
我邀请了本·夏皮罗 他参加了我制作的关于出埃及记的研讨会 与其他九位非常有趣的思想家一起

3893
01:50:56,450 --> 01:51:00,183
本就非常出色 你知道的 他被浪费了

3894
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:03,233
他被政治浪费了吗

3895
01:51:05,916 --> 01:51:11,100
政治是必要的 但“一国之下 唯有上帝”这一理念存在是有原因的

3896
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:14,066
因为政治 政治并非顶峰

3897
01:51:14,350 --> 01:51:15,633
永远不是顶峰

3898
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:21,750
如果你能在顶峰进行对话 政治对话就是次要的

3899
01:51:22,066 --> 01:51:23,483
而且它也是短暂的 对吧

3900
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:25,883
也有它可能崩塌的方式

3901
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:31,133
也有 你怎么说 政治事务也有深度的不同层次

3902
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:38,516
因为很多时候在YouTube上有效的是对疯狂的觉醒TikToks的反应或者做任何事情

3903
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:40,433
很容易就这样被归类

3904
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:41,766
是的 是的

3905
01:51:41,883 --> 01:51:43,266
这是一种浪费吗

3906
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:46,633
这不是最佳选择

3907
01:51:46,850 --> 01:51:53,700
但这是一个有趣的问题 对吧 关于你需要展示多少脚踝、裙摆或膝盖

3908
01:51:54,083 --> 01:52:01,450
从算法的角度来保持数字的增长 因为最终你在生产人们点击的内容

3909
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:07,966
你不想完全受制于你的观众 那是观众的捕获 但你也不想对于把握什么是流行趋势如此不知所措

3910
01:52:08,483 --> 01:52:12,450
以至于你变得模糊和过时

3911
01:52:12,716 --> 01:52:20,833
好吧 在你处理最高事务的同时

3912
01:52:21,550 --> 01:52:25,983
也使它们公众可接近 那是非常非常微妙的平衡

3913
01:52:26,783 --> 01:52:32,733
我的意思是 乔纳森·帕吉奥在这方面做得很好 尽管他的市场还是相对小众的

3914
01:52:33,016 --> 01:52:43,550
而且他肯定是更深奥的 可以说 比每日电线的家伙们更深奥 他们倾向于沉溺于政治 而这会不时沦为低俗的政治 对吧

3915
01:52:43,616 --> 01:52:47,233
为了点击而点击或是追逐算法

3916
01:52:47,350 --> 01:52:55,433
我的意思是 所有政治家也有这种危险 我见过很多有政治特质的人发展出了一种人设

3917
01:52:56,500 --> 01:53:01,066
这在美国尤其如此 我会说 因为美国人如此善于销售

3918
01:53:01,450 --> 01:53:03,783
我并不是贬低这一点

3919
01:53:04,283 --> 01:53:08,100
销售、市场营销、沟通确实很难

3920
01:53:09,316 --> 01:53:14,766
我最近看了《猫王》电影 我认为它很好地展现了这一点 因为猫王是一个杰出的天才

3921
01:53:15,266 --> 01:53:19,183
但他的经纪人 一个真正的骗子 也是一个杰出的天才

3922
01:53:19,583 --> 01:53:23,450
就像没有他那个腐败的经纪人 猫王就不会成为他自己

3923
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:28,016
你知道 这有点像与魔鬼交易 但你也必须给魔鬼应有的尊重

3924
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:38,050
美国文化中的销售方面很容易沦为一种自恋式的操纵性

3925
01:53:38,766 --> 01:53:41,300
那是它变得病态时会走向的地方

3926
01:53:41,416 --> 01:53:48,850
但正如你所说 你必须了解你的观众 并且必须提供市场上有需求的内容

3927
01:53:48,966 --> 01:53:51,616
要做到这些非常困难

3928
01:53:51,950 --> 01:53:55,150
这是我对你明年即将出版的新书的一个问题

3929
01:53:55,616 --> 01:53:56,316
我还没看到任何内容

3930
01:53:57,216 --> 01:54:04,600
听起来 根据你目前的阅读 你正在试图处理宗教文本 特别是圣经 《我们与上帝搏斗》就是这本书的名字

3931
01:54:04,650 --> 01:54:09,100
是的 《我们与上帝搏斗》 是的 这就是“以色列”这个词的含义

3932
01:54:09,666 --> 01:54:11,516
“以色列”意味着“我们与上帝搏斗”

3933
01:54:12,016 --> 01:54:18,050
所以 这很有趣 因为这意味着被选民是与上帝搏斗的人

3934
01:54:18,716 --> 01:54:20,433
你可能会说 那么谁与上帝搏斗

3935
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:22,783
答案是 嗯 每个人都与上帝搏斗

3936
01:54:23,316 --> 01:54:23,933
为什么呢

3937
01:54:24,466 --> 01:54:27,700
因为你无法在不做出道德决定的情况下行动

3938
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:33,300
就像每向前迈出的一步都是基于道德决定的

3939
01:54:33,833 --> 01:54:35,350
所以我们都在与上帝搏斗

3940
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,050
上帝是一种道德决定吗

3941
01:54:42,633 --> 01:54:46,500
上帝是当你做出正确的道德决定时指引你的精神

3942
01:54:47,916 --> 01:54:49,933
所以我不会说上帝是一种道德决定

3943
01:54:50,116 --> 01:54:52,283
他是道德决定的精神

3944
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:56,300
所以这实际上不是一个坏的定义

3945
01:54:57,416 --> 01:55:05,466
我试图通过这本书做的部分事情是指出 圣经文献中发生的很多事情实际上是定义性的 对吧

3946
01:55:05,833 --> 01:55:11,900
好吧 现代人认为根本问题是你是否相信上帝

3947
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:13,716
但那不是根本问题

3948
01:55:13,816 --> 01:55:16,000
根本问题是你对上帝的定义是什么

3949
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:20,150
让我给你一个例子 这会让它更清晰

3950
01:55:20,566 --> 01:55:28,433
所以有一个中世纪的观点认为 上帝是“summum bonum” 这意味着所有好事之和或所有好事的本质

3951
01:55:29,133 --> 01:55:32,150
好吧 你可能会说 我不相信那个

3952
01:55:32,550 --> 01:55:35,633
记住 这是上帝的定义 对吧

3953
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:37,650
上帝是所有好事之和

3954
01:55:38,316 --> 01:55:40,533
好吧 好的 所以你不相信那个

3955
01:55:40,666 --> 01:55:41,833
好的 让我们拆解一下

3956
01:55:43,166 --> 01:55:45,850
你相信有些事情比其他事情更好吗

3957
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:47,533
嗯 人们会说是的

3958
01:55:47,650 --> 01:55:51,333
好的 那么你相信存在一个好的等级

3959
01:55:52,750 --> 01:55:57,333
好的 所有好的事物有共同之处吗

3960
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:01,683
答案必须是肯定的 因为否则你就没有对好的概念

3961
01:56:02,433 --> 01:56:08,100
对 好这个词意味着在好的事物之间有某种本质

3962
01:56:08,716 --> 01:56:12,916
好吧 那么中世纪对上帝的一个定义是好的本质

3963
01:56:14,150 --> 01:56:16,166
好吧 假设你不相信那个

3964
01:56:16,333 --> 01:56:19,483
好的 这是否意味着你不相信任何好的事物

3965
01:56:20,533 --> 01:56:23,383
那么 你如何行动呢

3966
01:56:23,550 --> 01:56:29,000
因为行动意味着做某些比你现在做的更好的事 对吧

3967
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:32,433
没有朝向好的事物的行动就没有行动

3968
01:56:32,950 --> 01:56:36,150
你可能会说 我不相信有一个统一的好

3969
01:56:36,850 --> 01:56:39,100
好吧 你相信有一个分裂的好

3970
01:56:39,366 --> 01:56:42,783
那么 当这些事物相互对立时 你该怎么办 对吧

3971
01:56:42,833 --> 01:56:44,266
这将导致责任的冲突

3972
01:56:44,666 --> 01:56:50,750
你是如何参考的 你参考什么来帮助你在不同的好之间进行裁决

3973
01:56:51,366 --> 01:56:53,483
通常你会这样做：如果你可以追求A

3974
01:56:54,066 --> 01:56:59,100
它是好的 或者B 它也是好的 但它们相冲突 那么你就选择更高的好

3975
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:01,000
好的 你相信有更高的好吗

3976
01:57:01,650 --> 01:57:05,883
如果你不这样认为 你就无法在好之间做出决定 这意味着你会陷入瘫痪

3977
01:57:06,533 --> 01:57:10,466
如果你相信有更高的好 那么你相信有最高的好吗

3978
01:57:11,066 --> 01:57:12,250
好吧 最高的好就是上帝

3979
01:57:12,933 --> 01:57:13,583
你这是什么意思

3980
01:57:13,950 --> 01:57:14,900
按定义来说

3981
01:57:15,950 --> 01:57:17,616
好的 所以现在你有了一个定义

3982
01:57:17,716 --> 01:57:19,483
那么 接下来的问题可能是

3983
01:57:20,266 --> 01:57:23,616
你与最高的好有什么关系

3984
01:57:23,716 --> 01:57:25,500
你可能会说 我没有关系

3985
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:29,133
就像 实际上你是有的 因为你在行动中与它有关系

3986
01:57:29,416 --> 01:57:30,166
你不能不这样

3987
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:38,583
关于圣经文献集的一个有趣的事情是 它基于这样的坚持

3988
01:57:39,216 --> 01:57:45,700
你与存在和成为有一种关系 就像一种个人关系

3989
01:57:45,750 --> 01:57:49,200
当你说圣经文献集时 你是指构成圣经的文本集合吗

3990
01:57:49,216 --> 01:57:51,933
是的 因为它本质上是一座图书馆 对吧

3991
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,383
圣经实际上是第一座图书馆

3992
01:57:55,200 --> 01:58:04,166
它是由非常多不同的人写作 并在数千年内聚集起来 然后实际上按照叙事顺序排列

3993
01:58:04,616 --> 01:58:08,183
有趣的是 因为没有人真正对其进行排序

3994
01:58:08,733 --> 01:58:12,616
或者说 没有任何个人进行排序

3995
01:58:12,750 --> 01:58:20,300
这是数千年来集体或者占据集体的精神的努力

3996
01:58:21,316 --> 01:58:24,533
但叙事是连贯的 这实在是相当了不起的事情

3997
01:58:25,266 --> 01:58:27,350
所以这个叙事是一次调查

3998
01:58:28,033 --> 01:58:29,516
第一 关于上帝的本质

3999
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:33,216
第二 关于与上帝的关系的本质

4000
01:58:33,816 --> 01:58:39,400
然后第三 关于与上帝的正确关系的本质 所有这些事情

4001
01:58:39,950 --> 01:58:43,483
而上帝是所有好事之和

4002
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:48,633
所以圣经是对人与好的关系的分析

4003
01:58:50,466 --> 01:59:00,433
出版《我们与上帝搏斗》后 为了你回顾这次出版并认为它是一次成功 需要发生什么

4004
01:59:01,116 --> 01:59:03,333
你希望发生什么

4005
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:06,500
你希望人们感受到什么或从这项工作中带走什么

4006
01:59:09,850 --> 01:59:12,500
我认为我们正处于反启蒙运动的开始

4007
01:59:15,583 --> 01:59:20,433
启蒙时代对人的观点是错误的

4008
01:59:20,833 --> 01:59:28,033
启蒙时代的观点导致了科学的产生 但现在的科学表明 启蒙时代对人的观点是错误的

4009
01:59:28,633 --> 01:59:28,950
你是什么意思

4010
01:59:29,816 --> 01:59:33,966
好吧 启蒙时代的人认为我们可以在世界上找到我们的定位

4011
01:59:34,666 --> 01:59:36,316
比方说 以一种实证的方式

4012
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:39,116
这是萨姆·哈里斯的提议

4013
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:43,300
你可以遵循事实

4014
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:48,350
你可以通过对事实的无情分析来定位自己

4015
01:59:49,716 --> 01:59:51,400
你做不到

4016
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:57,366
我会说人工智能工程师已经发现了这一点

4017
01:59:58,016 --> 02:00:00,366
后现代文学批评家已经发现了这一点

4018
02:00:00,966 --> 02:00:05,350
心理学家和感知生理学家已经发现了这一点

4019
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:07,950
神经科学家也已经发现了这一点

4020
02:00:08,516 --> 02:00:16,783
所以不仅仅是证据表明这种观点必然不正确 这是压倒性的 且是多维度的

4021
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:19,583
你不能通过事实来定位自己

4022
02:00:19,950 --> 02:00:20,233
为什么

4023
02:00:20,733 --> 02:00:24,200
因为事实和事物一样多

4024
02:00:25,116 --> 02:00:31,733
事实上 如果你组合事物 组合的性质也是一个事实

4025
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:35,133
所以事实和事物以及事物的组合一样多

4026
02:00:35,516 --> 02:00:38,100
嗯 你不能靠这个定位自己

4027
02:00:38,716 --> 02:00:40,466
那样的话 你就会在混沌中溺水

4028
02:00:40,850 --> 02:00:45,050
就像你站在沙漠中 有无限多的方向可以去

4029
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:47,266
那你怎么选择一个方向呢

4030
02:00:47,666 --> 02:00:53,850
这在我刚才提到的最新调查中显现出来 人们感到无意义、没有目的

4031
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:54,866
我被压倒了-对 迷失了

4032
02:00:54,866 --> 02:00:55,900
他们在沙漠中迷失了

4033
02:00:56,416 --> 02:00:57,416
他们在沙漠中迷失了

4034
02:00:58,533 --> 02:01:00,383
而这个沙漠就是事实的沙漠

4035
02:01:00,950 --> 02:01:02,000
这些是死的事实

4036
02:01:02,316 --> 02:01:07,350
特别是考虑到..很少有人能就这是一个事实还是这是一个反事实达成一致-

4037
02:01:07,833 --> 02:01:12,616
那也是一个问题 事实并不一定是显而易见的

4038
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:15,866
有些事实是 我想 在某种程度上

4039
02:01:16,133 --> 02:01:25,533
科学文献集就是一套无可争议的事实的阐述

4040
02:01:26,166 --> 02:01:29,633
我最近读到 整个大爆炸叙述开始崩解了

4041
02:01:30,050 --> 02:01:31,783
你知道 那长时间以来都被视为一个事实

4042
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:33,266
现在 我不知道是否还是这样

4043
02:01:33,350 --> 02:01:44,133
我对此不够了解 但我的感觉是 韦伯望远镜的新发现使得大爆炸模型所基于的许多假设变得存疑

4044
02:01:44,933 --> 02:01:55,300
所以现在我不想掉进后现代的兔子洞 因为尽管构成事实的问题是一个非常复杂的问题

4045
02:01:55,833 --> 02:02:02,266
无论如何 你可以通过指出我们如何在价值的层级中组织事实来迅速切入正题

4046
02:02:02,750 --> 02:02:06,250
你看 我在书中试图论证这一点

4047
02:02:08,633 --> 02:02:10,683
你在看世界时就是这样做的

4048
02:02:11,366 --> 02:02:14,400
你不可能不通过价值层级来看世界

4049
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:20,966
例如 当我们坐在这里时 我们的眼睛可以指向无数的地方

4050
02:02:21,450 --> 02:02:25,616
比如我可以一边和你说话一边看着混凝土地面上的这个小点

4051
02:02:26,016 --> 02:02:30,400
或者旁边的点 或者不断环绕它的无数个点

4052
02:02:30,633 --> 02:02:32,200
但我没有 我在看你的眼睛

4053
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:33,283
好吧 为什么

4054
02:02:33,616 --> 02:02:35,083
因为我在给它们优先级

4055
02:02:35,716 --> 02:02:40,350
所以在这个场景中占据主导地位的事实是你的眼睛这个事实

4056
02:02:40,816 --> 02:02:41,083
为什么

4057
02:02:43,550 --> 02:02:48,383
我可以用你的眼睛来评估我们共同的关注点 对吧

4058
02:02:50,166 --> 02:02:51,950
这就是我们看其他人眼睛的原因

4059
02:02:52,300 --> 02:02:54,150
这也是人类眼睛外围有白色的原因

4060
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:54,650
确切的

4061
02:02:55,016 --> 02:02:59,716
这样我们就能看到其他人关注的是什么 从而获得故事的洞察力

4062
02:03:00,816 --> 02:03:04,650
故事是价值层级的描述

4063
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:06,933
故事可以是奇幻的 对吧

4064
02:03:07,233 --> 02:03:08,866
如果它们与任何事物无关

4065
02:03:09,233 --> 02:03:10,783
我可以创造一个《哈利·波特》的故事

4066
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:15,333
如果它们与任何事物无关 你不会觉得它们有趣

4067
02:03:15,433 --> 02:03:16,333
因为它们不会引起共鸣

4068
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:18,433
它们不会吸引你

4069
02:03:19,416 --> 02:03:20,433
是的 它们是被束缚的

4070
02:03:21,333 --> 02:03:26,083
故事以非常非常复杂的方式与现实相连

4071
02:03:27,450 --> 02:03:31,466
因为现实并不是瞬间呈现的事物

4072
02:03:31,483 --> 02:03:46,416
哲学家之间有关于数学抽象的巨大争论

4073
02:03:46,416 --> 02:03:47,416
它们是真实的吗

4074
02:03:47,433 --> 02:03:52,550
嗯 你可以说一个数学抽象比它抽象出的事物更真实

4075
02:03:52,550 --> 02:03:55,316
你怎么论证这一点

4076
02:03:55,316 --> 02:03:58,833
如果你是数学的大师 你就掌握了世界

4077
02:03:58,850 --> 02:04:06,683
那么数学抽象是更真实还是更不真实呢 叙事抽象是抽象 但你可以说

4078
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:19,866
这就是原型的含义 原型是一种比现实世界更真实的叙事抽象 它在幕后 而圣经文献集是一个叙述

4079
02:04:21,266 --> 02:04:30,266
它是一个超现实的叙述 这是正确的思考方式 它比现实更真实 比现实更真实

4080
02:04:30,300 --> 02:04:32,700
一个事物如何能比该事物本身更真实

4081
02:04:32,716 --> 02:04:41,316
嗯 这正是抽象的问题 对吧 教堂的概念是否比一个具体的教堂更真实

4082
02:04:41,350 --> 02:04:53,950
在某些方面是的 因为它包含了所有教堂的共同之处 对吧 所以它就像是柏拉图理想 一个类别就像是柏拉图理想 它是更真实还是更不真实

4083
02:04:53,983 --> 02:05:02,266
嗯 你可以说现实 这是柏拉图所说的 现实是本质的黯淡影子

4084
02:05:02,266 --> 02:05:05,333
现实比理想更不真实

4085
02:05:05,416 --> 02:05:12,066
这在某种程度上实际上内置在我们的感知中

4086
02:05:12,083 --> 02:05:20,250
我们批评呈现给我们的事物 因为它们是被设想的理想的糟糕反映

4087
02:05:20,250 --> 02:05:21,733
你可能会说 嗯 理想不是真实的

4088
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:22,883
就像嗯

4089
02:05:24,433 --> 02:05:32,383
你可以完全相反地论证 理想比事物本身更真实 我可以给你举一个这些模式的例子

4090
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:35,600
所以在该隐和亚伯的故事中 你有两种牺牲的模式

4091
02:05:36,783 --> 02:05:36,983
好的

4092
02:05:37,916 --> 02:05:39,533
为什么牺牲是一个问题

4093
02:05:40,900 --> 02:05:46,433
问题在于人类与世界存在一种牺牲的关系

4094
02:05:46,433 --> 02:05:47,133
这意味着什么

4095
02:05:48,333 --> 02:05:53,333
这似乎意味着人类意识到他们的延伸自我

4096
02:05:53,550 --> 02:05:59,283
你知道你明天、下周、下个月、明年、五年后、十年后还会在

4097
02:05:59,350 --> 02:06:06,100
随着时间的推移 这变得不那么确定 但你确实有自己作为一个跨越几十年的存在的感觉

4098
02:06:06,966 --> 02:06:14,516
好吧 这意味着你必须以一种不仅仅是即时的方式来指导自己的行为

4099
02:06:15,033 --> 02:06:18,483
你必须以一种能够跨时间工作的方式来指导自己的行为

4100
02:06:18,916 --> 02:06:20,066
那么 人们是如何做到这一点的呢

4101
02:06:20,816 --> 02:06:21,350
他们工作

4102
02:06:22,216 --> 02:06:24,066
工作是一种牺牲的姿态

4103
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:28,650
所以你工作 从定义上来说 几乎就是

4104
02:06:29,633 --> 02:06:31,983
工作是现在对未来的牺牲

4105
02:06:33,200 --> 02:06:37,116
我的意思是 也许有人能提出一个比这更好的工作定义 但我不这么认为

4106
02:06:37,250 --> 02:06:40,400
就像你现在投入时间和努力

4107
02:06:40,466 --> 02:06:45,550
即使是你此刻可能不愿意做的事情

4108
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:47,983
你投入时间和努力 因为你相信

4109
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:49,733
这意味着什么

4110
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:51,600
你相信这会有所回报

4111
02:06:52,533 --> 02:06:55,383
那这是不是一种与未来的契约

4112
02:06:55,950 --> 02:06:56,800
这是一个盟约吗

4113
02:06:57,500 --> 02:07:06,133
因为圣经文献集坚称人类追求的特征关系是盟约

4114
02:07:06,550 --> 02:07:07,233
这是一笔交易

4115
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:12,283
交易是你做出正确的牺牲 它们就会得到回报

4116
02:07:13,250 --> 02:07:14,000
那就是交易

4117
02:07:14,750 --> 02:07:20,783
你可能会说 嗯 那只是社会契约的一部分 但圣经文献集坚持 这比那更深

4118
02:07:20,900 --> 02:07:22,883
它内置在现实本身的结构中

4119
02:07:23,533 --> 02:07:25,983
如果你做出了正确的牺牲

4120
02:07:27,250 --> 02:07:28,833
未来会是天堂般的

4121
02:07:29,766 --> 02:07:33,533
我脑海中浮现的是卡尔·荣格的那句话 小心未经挣得的智慧

4122
02:07:34,750 --> 02:07:38,383
感觉像是 感觉像是这在这里发挥了作用

4123
02:07:39,133 --> 02:07:48,883
就像你需要投入的工作 以便真正地认识事物 真正地吸引人的区别

4124
02:07:48,916 --> 02:07:56,216
因为你本身是吸引人的 和你能够成为一个搭讪艺术家 能够发出嘴巴的声音和手势 使得事情发生

4125
02:07:56,250 --> 02:07:58,100
那些是虚假牺牲的果实

4126
02:07:58,166 --> 02:08:05,050
你可以说 未赚取的道德声誉是虚假牺牲的后果

4127
02:08:05,533 --> 02:08:07,383
这就是表演性同理心 对吧

4128
02:08:07,450 --> 02:08:08,983
当然 完全是

4129
02:08:08,983 --> 02:08:09,400
在互联网上

4130
02:08:09,950 --> 02:08:12,400
绝对 这和公开祈祷是一样的

4131
02:08:12,766 --> 02:08:13,866
看我有多好

4132
02:08:14,733 --> 02:08:18,883
如果“看”在“我有多好”之前

4133
02:08:19,466 --> 02:08:20,733
对 对 对 对

4134
02:08:20,916 --> 02:08:23,983
这真的会破坏对好的主张

4135
02:08:24,116 --> 02:08:26,166
但这也是 我和道格拉斯谈过这个问题

4136
02:08:26,450 --> 02:08:30,083
这似乎几乎是一个预示者

4137
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:33,966
这是一个标识 让你对这个人的行为多一点谨慎

4138
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:34,483
绝对

4139
02:08:34,833 --> 02:08:39,916
你知道 每一个超级甜蜜和友好的人 莉佐

4140
02:08:40,233 --> 02:08:41,866
你看到莉佐最近上新闻了吗

4141
02:08:42,416 --> 02:08:42,516
没有

4142
02:08:43,016 --> 02:08:46,033
她是一位艺术家 歌手

4143
02:08:46,733 --> 02:08:50,900
她是那个因虐待她的密切合作伙伴而陷入麻烦的人 是的

4144
02:08:50,933 --> 02:08:55,100
跳舞者 是的 她让她的跳舞者从阿姆斯特丹的脱衣舞娘那里吃香蕉

4145
02:08:56,500 --> 02:08:59,816
道格拉斯说他-哦 那有点向享乐主义狂热的一面倾斜

4146
02:09:00,166 --> 02:09:08,333
嗯 她本应该是 你知道 这样的Bassey 为了女孩们 为了身体积极性和所有这些东西 但结果在幕后 她对她的舞者非常恶劣

4147
02:09:08,383 --> 02:09:14,083
一直在羞辱她们的身体 但她是这个特定运动的前锋

4148
02:09:14,150 --> 02:09:16,233
但你也看到了同样的情况 是吉米·法伦吗

4149
02:09:16,316 --> 02:09:21,883
我认为他最近被发现非常难以为伴 而且外表却是

4150
02:09:22,150 --> 02:09:24,016
艾伦·德杰尼勒斯 再次 同样

4151
02:09:24,633 --> 02:09:35,516
这几乎实际上像是如果某人非常像那样过度甜蜜和友好 我在这里为下属服务 你就会觉得

4152
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,133
我对那里发生的事情有点怀疑

4153
02:09:40,566 --> 02:09:45,816
如果你需要宣称你的纯洁和你的良好地位

4154
02:09:47,850 --> 02:09:50,316
如果这全都是言辞和观点而非行为

4155
02:09:50,550 --> 02:09:54,850
十诫之一是不要妄用上帝的名义

4156
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:57,850
好吧 现在人们认为这意味着不要说脏话

4157
02:09:58,566 --> 02:09:59,716
它在某种程度上意味着那个

4158
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:02,083
那是它的一个间接含义之一

4159
02:10:02,616 --> 02:10:10,833
但它真正的意思是 不要声称自我服务的行为有神圣的动机

4160
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:14,050
对 那就是表演性的同情

4161
02:10:14,650 --> 02:10:17,400
所以你做的是将同情提升到最高位置

4162
02:10:17,466 --> 02:10:24,150
所以你把它当作你的神 这是一个大错误 因为无论神是什么 他不仅仅是同情

4163
02:10:24,533 --> 02:10:29,966
你将同情提升到最高位置 然后你说 我为人们感到难过

4164
02:10:30,516 --> 02:10:34,533
这样做的结果是将你的道德地位提升到可能的最高的位置 对吧

4165
02:10:34,633 --> 02:10:42,850
这完全是未赚得的 因为这是J.K.罗琳用她的多洛雷斯·乌姆里奇角色非常准确地描绘的 对吧

4166
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,016
那是绝对的权力

4167
02:10:44,150 --> 02:10:46,216
总是穿粉红色 有猫

4168
02:10:46,466 --> 02:10:47,833
盘子上有小猫

4169
02:10:47,933 --> 02:10:49,850
这就像是有毒的感性

4170
02:10:50,283 --> 02:10:51,050
我很好

4171
02:10:51,150 --> 02:10:55,633
就像 是的 我想远离你和你那吞噬性的好

4172
02:10:56,550 --> 02:11:06,533
弗洛伊德学派很早就以非常复杂的方式了解到这一点 因为吞噬性的母亲 俄狄浦斯母亲 是同情的阴暗面

4173
02:11:06,916 --> 02:11:12,766
我一直试图为此找一个术语 我喜欢将事物命名为存在 给它们命名 很有用

4174
02:11:13,866 --> 02:11:18,033
目前我得到的最好的一个是“浅薄的同理心之池”

4175
02:11:18,450 --> 02:11:26,683
这是 目前来看 一种安抚人们且不立即给他们带来不适的东西

4176
02:11:27,333 --> 02:11:32,383
总是被优先考虑的 即使长期来看 这种做法最终导致了他们的痛苦

4177
02:11:32,616 --> 02:11:37,366
绝对 那正是俄狄浦斯情境

4178
02:11:37,916 --> 02:11:45,483
优先考虑短期情感安慰而不是中长期繁荣

4179
02:11:45,566 --> 02:11:51,216
因为把孩子踢出巢穴的母亲会说 这会立即伤害它

4180
02:11:51,933 --> 02:11:55,066
但是迭代的后果是积极的

4181
02:11:55,333 --> 02:11:56,233
米开朗基罗的《圣母怜子》

4182
02:11:57,033 --> 02:11:58,866
对 确切地说 就是这样 就是这样

4183
02:11:58,916 --> 02:12:07,700
这完全正确 故事的寓意是 如果你把你的孩子交给世界 你其实是在帮助他们 对吧

4184
02:12:07,816 --> 02:12:09,616
那是亚伯拉罕的牺牲

4185
02:12:10,766 --> 02:12:17,733
神呼召亚伯拉罕牺牲他的儿子 他答应了 其实他不必这么做

4186
02:12:17,833 --> 02:12:22,000
但你必须让你的孩子被世界打破 否则你就会失去他们

4187
02:12:22,500 --> 02:12:24,366
你会破坏他们 你会摧毁他们

4188
02:12:25,483 --> 02:12:27,583
这是一个非常矛盾的真理

4189
02:12:28,850 --> 02:12:33,733
我们谈到了模式 该隐是不恰当牺牲的模式

4190
02:12:34,733 --> 02:12:42,966
他做的一切都是二流的 他撒谎 他隐瞒 他搪塞 他假装

4191
02:12:43,550 --> 02:12:51,483
他没有奉献出他的最好 亚伯恰恰相反 他奉献了他的最好 这意味着他的光在山上照耀 对吧

4192
02:12:51,516 --> 02:13:00,616
没有隐藏 他全力以赴 与上帝的盟约是 如果你全力以赴 你将会胜出

4193
02:13:00,666 --> 02:13:02,033
这是上帝告诉该隐的

4194
02:13:02,533 --> 02:13:11,366
通过今天的一些讨论 本能 忠于那个本能 诚实 说出你的意思

4195
02:13:12,016 --> 02:13:20,183
不优先考虑为了避免别人的或你自己的短期不适 以便相信这将使你长期感觉更好

4196
02:13:21,233 --> 02:13:32,383
好吧 那就是一种牺牲 你愿意为了中长期的利益牺牲你的短期生理和心理舒适

4197
02:13:32,733 --> 02:13:35,300
牺牲的本质就是提供--

4198
02:13:36,100 --> 02:13:43,233
这是无神论者不理解圣经叙事的地方 圣经叙事坚持我们生活在一种牺牲的关系中

4199
02:13:43,316 --> 02:13:46,733
生活在牺牲的关系中是人性的本质

4200
02:13:47,116 --> 02:13:48,300
这是真的吗

4201
02:13:48,700 --> 02:13:54,816
嗯 随着你成熟 你的关系更加牺牲

4202
02:13:55,066 --> 02:14:04,750
它不那么关注你狭义上的当前所想 而更多关注中长期的好处 包括其他人

4203
02:14:05,233 --> 02:14:06,816
好吧 那是一种牺牲的关系

4204
02:14:06,950 --> 02:14:10,216
现在 这个盟约 这是一个信仰的问题

4205
02:14:11,033 --> 02:14:12,433
这是最深刻的信仰问题

4206
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:25,583
你愿意实践这样的主张吗 那就是使世界以最积极的方式向你展现 就是让你采纳

4207
02:14:26,950 --> 02:14:29,216
最恰当的牺牲关系

4208
02:14:29,533 --> 02:14:30,666
嗯 这是一个很大的风险 不是吗

4209
02:14:31,133 --> 02:14:32,483
因为你必须放弃一切

4210
02:14:32,916 --> 02:14:33,633
那就是交易

4211
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:38,433
你放弃所有低级的东西 一切 一切

4212
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:50,200
嗯 这就是基督教的激情 因为基督教的激情是一个原型故事 因为基督是彻底牺牲一切的人 100%

4213
02:14:52,366 --> 02:15:04,650
圣经的概念是 这与旧约中的上帝降临到人类现实空间中没有区别

4214
02:15:05,266 --> 02:15:10,166
所以上帝在旧约中被描述为一种精神

4215
02:15:10,266 --> 02:15:11,733
这是一种思考方式

4216
02:15:12,250 --> 02:15:15,416
具体化了 对 进入了法律和先知中

4217
02:15:15,966 --> 02:15:18,633
基督将自己呈现为那的体现

4218
02:15:19,050 --> 02:15:20,950
所以想象一下 这是一种思考方式

4219
02:15:22,050 --> 02:15:24,866
你可以邀请各种精神来占有你

4220
02:15:26,050 --> 02:15:28,016
这就是你在愤怒中屈服时所做的

4221
02:15:28,633 --> 02:15:31,583
这就是你在屈服于欲望时所做的 比如说

4222
02:15:32,700 --> 02:15:35,666
你允许精神来占有你

4223
02:15:36,900 --> 02:15:43,050
那么 如果你只是允许最高的精神来占有你 你会变成什么样子呢

4224
02:15:43,650 --> 02:15:46,300
嗯 这就是新约中提出的问题

4225
02:15:46,783 --> 02:15:47,983
而部分答案是

4226
02:15:51,866 --> 02:16:00,183
如果你允许所有可能的最高精神占有你 你将能够面对生活可能抛给你的一切

4227
02:16:00,466 --> 02:16:14,166
这就是在基督教的激情中发生的 因为生活能抛给你的最坏事情是最大的悲剧 而最大的悲剧是最糟糕、最痛苦的死亡 被施加给最不应该的人 对吧

4228
02:16:14,233 --> 02:16:18,033
这是悲剧的终极延伸 好吗

4229
02:16:18,116 --> 02:16:18,933
那还不够

4230
02:16:19,066 --> 02:16:22,600
基督必须面对那个 他还必须面对恶意

4231
02:16:22,716 --> 02:16:23,866
那是地狱的洗礼

4232
02:16:24,416 --> 02:16:27,033
所以想法是 要完全适应生活

4233
02:16:27,716 --> 02:16:37,300
你必须让自己被那种能让你自愿面对不公正的痛苦、死亡和邪恶的精神所占有

4234
02:16:38,233 --> 02:16:40,550
这样 你对此有什么反驳吗

4235
02:16:40,850 --> 02:16:42,300
还能怎样呢

4236
02:16:43,566 --> 02:16:51,716
我认为 当人们考虑长期将要发生的事情时 我看到人们对这种程度的压力做出反应

4237
02:16:53,433 --> 02:16:57,516
我现在面前有不适 我需要面对

4238
02:16:58,100 --> 02:17:01,300
如果我将来想要做一些我认为我应该做的事情 我需要经历这些不舒服

4239
02:17:01,700 --> 02:17:05,566
他们提出的一个解决方案 虽然不是解决方案 但对他们来说有点是

4240
02:17:06,116 --> 02:17:07,500
我什么都不会做

4241
02:17:07,566 --> 02:17:07,750
是的

4242
02:17:10,833 --> 02:17:14,233
不做决定与中性选择几乎相同

4243
02:17:15,366 --> 02:17:22,150
我的一个朋友 亚历克斯 有一句我很喜欢的话 他说 生活中最沉重的东西不是铁和金 而是未做的决定

4244
02:17:22,716 --> 02:17:27,000
你感到压力是因为你有决定要做 但你没有做

4245
02:17:27,766 --> 02:17:30,383
是的 是的 确实如此 确实如此

4246
02:17:31,066 --> 02:17:31,700
毫无疑问

4247
02:17:31,833 --> 02:17:35,833
没有所谓的不做决定 对吧

4248
02:17:35,916 --> 02:17:39,683
因为随着你的老去

4249
02:17:41,100 --> 02:17:44,866
你为你的不决定付出代价

4250
02:17:45,033 --> 02:17:47,983
这是一个决定 本质上是为了避免

4251
02:17:49,150 --> 02:17:59,100
你知道 《约伯记》和《基督教受难记》中所蕴含的部分道德是 你可以掌控自己将要面对的事情

4252
02:18:01,033 --> 02:18:03,716
也许这是真的 也许这是真的

4253
02:18:03,916 --> 02:18:08,450
我的意思是 临床文献似乎表明这是真的 因为你做的一件事是--

4254
02:18:09,166 --> 02:18:20,933
如果你是一个有能力的临床医生 你会看看人们试图完成什么 也许那需要一些调整 但假设他们有一个目标

4255
02:18:22,133 --> 02:18:27,816
经过与他们的战略讨论 这个目标是有效的

4256
02:18:27,833 --> 02:18:34,566
他们有一个清晰规划的愿景 好的 现在他们正在规划愿景 并遇到了阻碍他们的障碍

4257
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:43,100
也许这些障碍让他们感到害怕 使他们瘫痪 然后你所做的就是分解这个障碍

4258
02:18:43,116 --> 02:18:51,933
就像我们之前谈到的 直到你找到他们能够前进并且构成真正进步的方法 他们将真正去做

4259
02:18:52,066 --> 02:18:55,583
所以你所做的就是把问题细化 直到他们愿意面对它

4260
02:18:56,766 --> 02:18:57,766
好的 然后他们面对了它

4261
02:18:58,200 --> 02:18:58,966
然后会发生什么

4262
02:18:59,350 --> 02:19:00,350
他们变得更有能力

4263
02:19:01,050 --> 02:19:01,800
就是这样发生的

4264
02:19:02,316 --> 02:19:04,566
然后他们在面对所有问题上变得更加擅长

4265
02:19:05,016 --> 02:19:07,466
所以他们不仅仅学会了如何处理那个特定问题

4266
02:19:08,033 --> 02:19:11,650
他们学到了一个可以泛化到各种问题上的教训 他们变得更加勇敢

4267
02:19:12,300 --> 02:19:22,350
当你使用暴露疗法时 人们不是变得不那么害怕 而是变得更加勇敢 这更好 因为勇敢可以从一个情境转移到另一个情境

4268
02:19:22,700 --> 02:19:25,650
好的 那么问题来了

4269
02:19:26,900 --> 02:19:31,766
如果你面对了摆在你面前的一切 你会成为谁

4270
02:19:32,650 --> 02:19:35,433
嗯 答案 圣经的答案是 你会成为上帝真正的儿子

4271
02:19:35,900 --> 02:19:37,016
那是圣经的答案

4272
02:19:37,700 --> 02:19:39,083
这样 你相信吗

4273
02:19:39,950 --> 02:19:41,750
嗯 这取决于你所说的“相信”的意思是什么

4274
02:19:42,966 --> 02:19:47,650
你认为你有比面对眼前的事情更好的选择吗

4275
02:19:48,033 --> 02:19:50,900
嗯 你只需理智地考虑一下

4276
02:19:50,950 --> 02:19:56,666
就是 你的理论是你通过谎言和逃避能更好地适应吗

4277
02:19:57,850 --> 02:19:59,333
因为那是相反的理论

4278
02:19:59,700 --> 02:20:08,033
你要么面对它 这是基于信念 如果你这样做 你内在的某些东西会有所回应

4279
02:20:08,966 --> 02:20:12,050
要么你不面对它 就这样 就是这些选项

4280
02:20:12,933 --> 02:20:14,916
如果你不面对它 那也是一种信念

4281
02:20:15,566 --> 02:20:21,750
那是对逃避和欺骗将足够（解决一切）的观念的信仰

4282
02:20:22,066 --> 02:20:24,516
我认为对很多人来说 这是出于恐惧

4283
02:20:25,533 --> 02:20:27,883
这是出于做一个讨好他人的人

4284
02:20:28,833 --> 02:20:36,583
不想伤害你周围的其他人 不想告诉他们他们不想听到的事情 或者不做或不说你知道会让你周围的人不高兴的事情

4285
02:20:36,750 --> 02:20:37,916
对 但又一次 是短期的

4286
02:20:38,266 --> 02:20:38,366
是的

4287
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:40,050
再次说到短期 你知道

4288
02:20:40,416 --> 02:20:41,966
如果你看一个好母亲

4289
02:20:42,533 --> 02:20:44,316
一个好母亲经常让她的孩子们不高兴

4290
02:20:44,816 --> 02:20:45,716
别那样做

4291
02:20:46,433 --> 02:20:46,583
为什么

4292
02:20:47,383 --> 02:20:48,033
嗯 为什么

4293
02:20:48,033 --> 02:20:50,283
为什么不让你的孩子完全按照他们想要的去做呢

4294
02:20:50,366 --> 02:20:53,200
答案是 首先 这会让他们感到恐惧

4295
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,883
因为孩子们实际上是想要界限的

4296
02:20:57,433 --> 02:21:00,150
他们不想在沙漠中随心所欲

4297
02:21:00,250 --> 02:21:04,100
他们想要一个有墙的空间 在那里他们有最佳的自由度

4298
02:21:04,866 --> 02:21:13,250
所以真正爱别人的人不会不惜一切代价避免让他们不高兴

4299
02:21:13,666 --> 02:21:16,266
那是吞噬型母亲

4300
02:21:17,983 --> 02:21:22,266
如果你爱某人 那就是圣经引文 你应该管教他们

4301
02:21:22,333 --> 02:21:23,083
这意味着什么

4302
02:21:23,166 --> 02:21:30,833
就像 看 如果你爱某人 他们在做蠢事和自毁行为 而你能看出来 那你有责任说

4303
02:21:31,366 --> 02:21:37,150
你知道 这会让你不高兴 但据我所知 你在做蠢事和自毁行为

4304
02:21:37,700 --> 02:21:42,250
然后因此会有争执 因为他们会说 你凭什么评判

4305
02:21:42,416 --> 02:21:45,833
这是一个非常好的问题 是什么让你认为你是对的

4306
02:21:45,933 --> 02:21:47,916
这就是我这么做的原因

4307
02:21:48,033 --> 02:21:53,283
你知道 这些是我曾经经历的可怕经历 促使我选择这条道路

4308
02:21:53,366 --> 02:21:55,316
有时这可能非常有说服力

4309
02:21:55,400 --> 02:22:04,216
你知道 你遇到过充满怨恨和不满的人 然后他们告诉你他们的生活 你想 嗯

4310
02:22:04,733 --> 02:22:08,300
但是你也遇到过生活同样糟糕但不怨恨不满的人 对吧

4311
02:22:08,333 --> 02:22:09,133
他们过得更好

4312
02:22:09,533 --> 02:22:15,716
所以即使看起来似乎是合理的 可能即使是合理的 它也不是合理的

4313
02:22:16,166 --> 02:22:24,200
我认为这种讨好他人的倾向最常见的情况之一是 某人可能认为他们应该结束一段关系

4314
02:22:24,233 --> 02:22:27,933
但其没有这么做 而是为了保护他们的伴侣而留下

4315
02:22:28,016 --> 02:22:35,416
我在Reddit上找到了一个帖子 是如果你对你的关系不确定应该问自己的五个问题

4316
02:22:36,616 --> 02:22:40,533
如果有人告诉你你很像你的伴侣 这对你来说是一种赞美吗

4317
02:22:41,666 --> 02:22:44,300
你真的满足了吗 还是只是不那么孤单

4318
02:22:45,433 --> 02:22:51,050
你能够毫无歉意地做自己 还是你觉得需要以不同的方式出现来取悦你的伴侣

4319
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:58,383
你爱你伴侣的全部现在的样子 还是你只爱他们的好的一面、他们的潜力或他们的想法

4320
02:22:59,250 --> 02:23:04,383
你会希望你未来或想象中的孩子和像你的伴侣这样的人约会吗

4321
02:23:05,166 --> 02:23:08,416
这个讨论帖子里充满了经历存在危机的人

4322
02:23:08,950 --> 02:23:21,666
这在我看来似乎是一群人的集合 他们设法相信继续拖延、短期内推迟他们想要围绕伴侣做出的决定所带来的不适

4323
02:23:22,533 --> 02:23:34,466
不知怎的成了一件高尚的事情、好事情、有德行的事情 或是最终会带来最佳结果的事情

4324
02:23:34,500 --> 02:23:39,600
即使他们知道如果他们拖延得足够久 最后就只是隐藏起来了 我们只是把它扫到了地毯下

4325
02:23:39,650 --> 02:23:41,866
所以是的 那五个问题的清单 我认为

4326
02:23:42,450 --> 02:23:47,516
在大多数关系中 你可以选择分手或者可以选择进行一千次争吵 你知道

4327
02:23:47,666 --> 02:23:50,233
如果你进行了一千次争吵 那你就不必争吵了

4328
02:23:52,016 --> 02:24:00,183
通过这种方式你实现了和平 因为你和你的伴侣是不同的 所以有些事情需要解决 你可能会认为这是一种妥协

4329
02:24:00,216 --> 02:24:06,416
但它不是 因为你和你的伴侣是不同的 你们需要找到一个你们都想玩的游戏

4330
02:24:06,500 --> 02:24:08,950
这不是妥协 这是解决方案

4331
02:24:09,500 --> 02:24:19,166
就像你把你的技能带到桌子上 我也把我的技能带到桌子上 然后我们找到一个可以让我们都最优化利用的游戏 这个游戏比我们单独玩要好

4332
02:24:19,366 --> 02:24:20,550
这不是妥协

4333
02:24:21,416 --> 02:24:30,283
但是达到这一点非常困难 人们会带着各种包袱进入一段关系 你必须 这真的就像管教孩子一样

4334
02:24:30,716 --> 02:24:31,500
这是同样的事情

4335
02:24:32,616 --> 02:24:35,566
你的孩子让你感到烦恼 你可以注意到这一点

4336
02:24:35,766 --> 02:24:36,450
你可以注意到这一点

4337
02:24:36,700 --> 02:24:38,183
啊 我被我的孩子烦恼了

4338
02:24:38,316 --> 02:24:39,750
那么你会问什么问题

4339
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:42,783
我是个专横的家伙 容易动怒吗

4340
02:24:43,300 --> 02:24:45,566
这就是为什么你需要你的妻子 因为你可以去问她

4341
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,133
我的孩子让我烦恼

4342
02:24:47,216 --> 02:24:49,533
我是个专横的家伙 容易动怒吗

4343
02:24:49,950 --> 02:24:53,433
她说 是的 你可能需要吃点东西 或者你就是那种人

4344
02:24:53,516 --> 02:24:55,383
你得听 因为可能是你的问题

4345
02:24:55,766 --> 02:24:59,150
或者她说 是的 那个该死的孩子也一直让我头疼

4346
02:24:59,516 --> 02:25:02,483
然后你们互相问 我们是共同的暴君吗

4347
02:25:02,850 --> 02:25:05,583
就像 不 那个孩子确实让人烦

4348
02:25:06,150 --> 02:25:08,816
好吧 我们希望他让人烦恼吗

4349
02:25:09,900 --> 02:25:12,883
嗯 如果你爱你的孩子 那么答案应该是否定的

4350
02:25:14,216 --> 02:25:16,550
因为如果他让你烦恼 他也会让其他人烦恼

4351
02:25:16,733 --> 02:25:18,583
他会让他潜在的朋友烦恼

4352
02:25:18,633 --> 02:25:19,983
他会让其他成年人烦恼

4353
02:25:20,466 --> 02:25:23,933
他会在世界上让人烦恼 每个人都会对他皱眉

4354
02:25:24,366 --> 02:25:25,233
那没帮助

4355
02:25:25,800 --> 02:25:27,300
所以你可以解决它

4356
02:25:27,950 --> 02:25:30,116
这会引起一些短期的不安

4357
02:25:30,650 --> 02:25:38,400
你知道 也许你有一个13个月大的孩子 非常外向和不易合作 他们支配着一切

4358
02:25:38,616 --> 02:25:46,383
每当母亲离开她一英尺远时 她就会发出尖叫 因为她已经学会了控制

4359
02:25:47,316 --> 02:25:51,800
也许母亲还被婴儿护理所束缚 无法设定界限

4360
02:25:51,866 --> 02:25:57,150
所以现在你必须对这个即将成为怪物的14个月大的孩子采取行动

4361
02:25:57,700 --> 02:26:00,933
你要做的一件事是 每当孩子表现出霸道时

4362
02:26:01,533 --> 02:26:07,550
首先 你要注意到这一点 并且你会发现自己对被一个14个月大的孩子统治并不怎么满意

4363
02:26:08,750 --> 02:26:11,400
这有点像是地位的打击 就像它应该的那样

4364
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:14,116
所以你必须注意到 这个孩子让我烦恼

4365
02:26:14,650 --> 02:26:16,016
那我应该对此做些什么

4366
02:26:16,266 --> 02:26:18,650
嗯 这会引起短期的情绪困扰

4367
02:26:19,400 --> 02:26:21,750
当你处理伴侣问题时也是同样的情况

4368
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:23,583
就像 你在烦我

4369
02:26:24,466 --> 02:26:26,700
好吧 现在可能是我

4370
02:26:27,566 --> 02:26:29,783
所以我应该好好地 也许我们应该谈谈这个问题

4371
02:26:30,100 --> 02:26:30,983
你在烦我

4372
02:26:32,050 --> 02:26:33,433
说服我这是我的问题

4373
02:26:34,400 --> 02:26:36,166
我应该听 因为可能是我

4374
02:26:36,633 --> 02:26:39,766
如果我因你烦恼而我不应该烦恼 我应该解决这个问题

4375
02:26:40,133 --> 02:26:40,966
但也许是你

4376
02:26:41,350 --> 02:26:43,916
所以让我们找出到底发生了什么

4377
02:26:44,250 --> 02:26:50,933
你知道 这通常会 哇 这会在这样的讨论中不断有推进和反推

4378
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:58,583
通常 你知道 谈话会围绕着该死的问题转圈 直到你弄清楚它的底细 天知道那是什么

4379
02:26:58,950 --> 02:27:00,433
但那时你或许可以解决它

4380
02:27:01,100 --> 02:27:04,016
你知道 如果你解决了足够多的这些问题 你就会和平生活

4381
02:27:04,733 --> 02:27:06,466
那是值得追求的东西

4382
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:12,616
你知道 我在我的婚姻中一直认为 没有什么是太小而不值得争吵的

4383
02:27:13,150 --> 02:27:17,383
现在 你知道 我制定了一些规则 我也曾经用在我的来访者身上

4384
02:27:17,516 --> 02:27:21,733
就像 如果有人烦你 你应该注意到这一点

4385
02:27:23,050 --> 02:27:24,816
你可能不应该采取任何行动

4386
02:27:25,516 --> 02:27:30,966
如果他们以同样的方式烦你两次 那么你会想 哦 好吧 这是第二次了

4387
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:33,450
但可能你仍然不应该采取任何行动

4388
02:27:33,516 --> 02:27:38,300
但如果他们三次烦你 那么你可以说 你刚才做了什么

4389
02:27:38,766 --> 02:27:40,233
他们会说 不 我没有那样做

4390
02:27:40,600 --> 02:27:41,900
然后你说 是的 你做了

4391
02:27:42,666 --> 02:27:45,616
而且你在另一种情况下做了完全相同的事情

4392
02:27:46,150 --> 02:27:48,766
还有在另一种情况下你也做了完全相同的事情

4393
02:27:48,850 --> 02:27:52,700
所以别告诉我你没做 因为你做了三次 我看着呢

4394
02:27:53,500 --> 02:27:55,533
好 现在他们会找出他们做这些事的理由

4395
02:27:55,816 --> 02:27:58,916
也许其中一些理由与你是个愚蠢的混蛋有关

4396
02:27:59,366 --> 02:28:02,283
你应该听 因为也许他们是对的

4397
02:28:02,750 --> 02:28:07,333
但那至少是你开始解开问题的过程

4398
02:28:08,050 --> 02:28:09,800
你想弄清楚 嗯 我们不想这样做

4399
02:28:11,016 --> 02:28:12,600
这不是我们想要对待彼此的方式

4400
02:28:13,516 --> 02:28:22,533
我们想达到一个地方 我们想到达一个地方 那里的整个生活就像我们曾经最好的约会中最好的时刻一样

4401
02:28:24,316 --> 02:28:25,066
那是一个很好的目标

4402
02:28:25,766 --> 02:28:29,933
而且是可实现的

4403
02:28:30,300 --> 02:28:31,200
你得努力 伙计

4404
02:28:32,400 --> 02:28:39,966
在《创世纪》中有一个场景 上帝把亚当和夏娃赶出伊甸园

4405
02:28:40,950 --> 02:28:43,783
因为他们的骄傲 他们的骄傲之罪

4406
02:28:45,100 --> 02:28:51,800
他们每个人都有自己特定版本的罪 夏娃的罪和亚当的 但他们都因为骄傲被赶出伊甸园

4407
02:28:52,900 --> 02:28:58,816
上帝在伊甸园的大门放置了基路伯 这些基路伯是一种怪异的天使

4408
02:28:59,333 --> 02:29:04,783
可怕的形象 他们手持燃烧着的、四面转动的火焰剑

4409
02:29:05,733 --> 02:29:08,066
你可能会问 这意味着什么

4410
02:29:08,200 --> 02:29:12,650
这意味着 好吧 剑是用来割裂的东西 对吧

4411
02:29:12,866 --> 02:29:16,983
一把锋利的刀刃 而火是用来燃烧的

4412
02:29:17,666 --> 02:29:20,483
而一把燃烧的剑 燃烧并割裂

4413
02:29:20,866 --> 02:29:29,066
而一把四面转动的燃烧剑是一把无物可逃的燃烧剑

4414
02:29:30,100 --> 02:29:33,016
好的 现在 你想要走进天堂

4415
02:29:33,816 --> 02:29:37,566
你身上所有不配天堂的东西都必须被燃烧和割除 对吧

4416
02:29:37,750 --> 02:29:39,916
嗯 那就是关系中的那场冲突

4417
02:29:40,633 --> 02:29:45,466
你知道 那是不适合天堂的

4418
02:29:45,950 --> 02:29:46,766
它必须做什么

4419
02:29:47,366 --> 02:29:51,700
它必须被投入外面的黑暗 在那里将有牙齿的咬合 对吧

4420
02:29:52,316 --> 02:29:58,266
它必须被割除并摧毁 所有不配的东西都必须离开

4421
02:29:58,816 --> 02:30:05,533
嗯 米开朗基罗效应是关于你和你的伴侣成为彼此的理想化版本 对吧

4422
02:30:05,766 --> 02:30:14,200
你将为我做我想要的事情 在你控制的参数内 你想成为最好的伴侣 我也想为你做同样的事

4423
02:30:14,500 --> 02:30:22,016
我们都将互相沟通 我们会在我们有界限的地方站稳脚跟 在我们想要妥协的地方继续妥协

4424
02:30:22,016 --> 02:30:22,933
这就是爱应该做的事情

4425
02:30:23,033 --> 02:30:23,950
这就是爱应该做的事情

4426
02:30:24,116 --> 02:30:33,483
像 如果你爱某人 如果是真爱 你会看到他们隐藏的灵魂

4427
02:30:33,666 --> 02:30:34,950
这是一种很好的思考方式

4428
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:39,150
你会瞥见他们能向世界展示的光 如果他们展示出来的话

4429
02:30:39,316 --> 02:30:40,016
这就是你看到的

4430
02:30:40,700 --> 02:30:46,683
然后以爱的名义行事就是鼓励那个展示出来 并阻止任何妨碍它的东西

4431
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:52,783
这就是为什么我喜欢米开朗基罗效应 我听说过它 我一直在使用它- 好的 那为什么是米开朗基罗效应

4432
02:30:52,966 --> 02:30:53,483
这就是原因

4433
02:30:54,033 --> 02:30:57,800
米开朗基罗看到这一大块未雕琢的大理石

4434
02:30:57,950 --> 02:30:59,100
对 哦 我明白了 我明白了

4435
02:30:59,400 --> 02:31:01,300
在那之中 他能够看到大卫

4436
02:31:02,366 --> 02:31:05,550
随着时间的推移 他会慢慢地雕刻 不断雕刻 不断雕刻

4437
02:31:06,233 --> 02:31:16,466
所以你看到的是那个未被雕刻出来的东西 它粗糙、未经雕琢、未开化、未驯服、吵闹 有时甚至很可怕

4438
02:31:17,533 --> 02:31:19,166
你能够从中进行炼金术

4439
02:31:19,233 --> 02:31:23,616
是的 这实际上是《道德经》的一部分 未雕刻的木块

4440
02:31:24,300 --> 02:31:27,933
所以在道家看来 孩子是未雕刻的木块

4441
02:31:28,750 --> 02:31:35,116
你移除所有多余的东西 直到完美的东西留下 对吧

4442
02:31:35,216 --> 02:31:42,100
这就是 在旧约和新约中的道（Logos） 创造世界的道

4443
02:31:43,116 --> 02:31:52,083
是分离麦子和糠秕的裁判能力 对吧

4444
02:31:52,133 --> 02:32:00,450
这在某种意义上是慈悲 因为如果你对某人充满慈悲 你希望考虑一切后给他们最好的

4445
02:32:00,916 --> 02:32:09,366
但这种最高意义上的慈悲不能没有判断 因为判断是你身上的这一部分不值得继续存在

4446
02:32:09,850 --> 02:32:11,583
当然 这正是你对孩子们所做的

4447
02:32:11,650 --> 02:32:17,500
当你看到他们表现不好时 你会想 不 那不行 不是那样

4448
02:32:18,133 --> 02:32:19,400
更成熟一些

4449
02:32:19,466 --> 02:32:24,583
即使是前几天我和我的小孙女在一起 她非常顽皮 是个非常好的小女孩

4450
02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:28,866
她非常顽皮 非常有趣 搞笑 不神经质

4451
02:32:29,683 --> 02:32:38,200
和她在一起很愉快 但她有一段时间没见我了 所以她在戳我让我追着她跑 戳我 然后过来给我一拳

4452
02:32:38,216 --> 02:32:44,616
有一次她打我太重了 她知道 我说 那不好玩

4453
02:32:44,666 --> 02:32:51,233
那是不可接受的 然后她停下了 但她在试探那个界限 试图找出什么是好玩的 你知道

4454
02:32:51,533 --> 02:32:53,216
我能打爷爷多重

4455
02:32:53,216 --> 02:32:57,516
她确实知道 她有点明白 但她需要确切地知道

4456
02:32:58,416 --> 02:33:01,683
我不能让她就这样得逞 因为那样她就不好玩了

4457
02:33:02,166 --> 02:33:08,733
她必须学会怎样恰到好处地给爷爷一下 以引起玩耍的反应 而不是烦人

4458
02:33:09,150 --> 02:33:14,383
所以这对一个五岁的孩子来说 你可能会认为 这是个相当苛刻的判断

4459
02:33:14,450 --> 02:33:15,266
就像 不 不是这样的

4460
02:33:15,433 --> 02:33:19,600
我希望她成为我能够玩得最开心的孩子 对吧

4461
02:33:19,650 --> 02:33:22,116
所以当它不对的时候 我不会假装这没事

4462
02:33:22,350 --> 02:33:24,733
不设定那个界限几乎就像是一种诅咒

4463
02:33:25,150 --> 02:33:25,750
它是一种诅咒

4464
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:27,050
是的 你去吧

4465
02:33:27,266 --> 02:33:31,716
是的 因为如果她不知道规则 她怎么能和其他孩子一起玩呢

4466
02:33:31,833 --> 02:33:33,566
他们不会像爷爷那样宽容

4467
02:33:33,950 --> 02:33:34,733
绝对不会

4468
02:33:35,400 --> 02:33:36,966
是的 我们在开始前就谈过了

4469
02:33:37,350 --> 02:33:42,216
我和罗伯特·萨波尔斯基进行了一次非常深刻的对话

4470
02:33:42,350 --> 02:33:49,133
我的意思是 我知道他是个聪明的家伙 他的这本新书是关于自由意志和决定论的 这对我来说有一个最感兴趣的上限

4471
02:33:49,800 --> 02:33:58,383
但他给了安德鲁·休布曼一个引用 他说 “多巴胺不是关于幸福的追求 它是关于追求的幸福

4472
02:33:58,850 --> 02:33:59,916
对 绝对正确

4473
02:34:00,266 --> 02:34:02,983
我一直无法停止在每个地方看到这一点

4474
02:34:03,033 --> 02:34:07,216
所以摩根·豪塞尔 一个朋友告诉我这个很棒的故事

4475
02:34:08,150 --> 02:34:12,150
他是一位投资者 他有一个基金 他是一位作者 他有一个家庭 他有所有这些事情

4476
02:34:13,050 --> 02:34:14,166
他们计划去度假

4477
02:34:15,116 --> 02:34:22,500
他们已经计划了很长时间 和孩子们、妻子以及他和他所有的生意一起 这是一个艰苦的过程 要把他们自己带到那里

4478
02:34:23,316 --> 02:34:27,850
最后 经过旅途和飞机和孩子们的哭泣以及所有其他的事情后 他们到达了那里

4479
02:34:27,933 --> 02:34:31,766
他在第一个晚上走出阳台 这是他们永远计划的假期

4480
02:34:32,433 --> 02:34:37,233
他的第一个想法是 如果我们明年能再来这里就好了

4481
02:34:38,166 --> 02:34:40,483
如果我们明年能再来这里就太好了

4482
02:34:40,533 --> 02:34:48,116
所以字面上 在假定的目的地享受期间 他已经在想下一次旅程了

4483
02:34:48,700 --> 02:34:54,066
“不是目的地 而是旅程”听起来有点老套 但它给了一个新的视角

4484
02:34:54,633 --> 02:34:55,816
没有目的地

4485
02:34:55,950 --> 02:35:00,933
每个目的地仅仅是下一次旅程的开始 我一直无法不这么看

4486
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:03,116
我到处都能看到

4487
02:35:03,133 --> 02:35:04,266
我在我自己的生活中到处都能看到

4488
02:35:04,266 --> 02:35:06,850
从技术上讲 有两种不同形式的奖励

4489
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:09,100
有满足性奖励

4490
02:35:09,766 --> 02:35:10,916
所以那是奖励

4491
02:35:11,333 --> 02:35:12,433
那就是高潮所带来的

4492
02:35:12,733 --> 02:35:13,916
它是满足性奖励

4493
02:35:14,450 --> 02:35:19,216
它终止了行为和感知序列

4494
02:35:19,650 --> 02:35:20,666
它结束了 对吧

4495
02:35:20,733 --> 02:35:22,000
在高潮时 它结束了

4496
02:35:22,300 --> 02:35:22,983
但那之后就结束了

4497
02:35:23,416 --> 02:35:25,466
那次旅程结束了 对吧

4498
02:35:26,150 --> 02:35:35,433
然后是萨波尔斯基谈到的多巴胺奖励 多巴胺奖励是朝目标前进的证据 对吧

4499
02:35:35,916 --> 02:35:37,983
好的 那么这有一个相应的观点

4500
02:35:39,766 --> 02:35:55,333
那么 如何达到最佳参与度呢 因为多巴胺促进了参与度和专注度 这就是为什么像安非他明这样的药物可以用于注意力缺陷障碍的孩子

4501
02:35:55,933 --> 02:35:59,300
你增加多巴胺反应 他们就能集中注意力 对吧

4502
02:35:59,666 --> 02:36:01,950
好的 所以他们专注于目标导向的追求

4503
02:36:02,533 --> 02:36:08,483
安非他明的问题是它们可能让你如此专注以至于你无法跳出框架

4504
02:36:08,866 --> 02:36:13,400
所以比如服用安非他明的孩子会沉迷于整理他们的衣柜

4505
02:36:13,500 --> 02:36:15,283
他们无法转换到下一个活动

4506
02:36:15,733 --> 02:36:20,366
好的 多巴胺奖励是与目标有关的奖励

4507
02:36:20,950 --> 02:36:23,000
好的 那么这意味着什么

4508
02:36:23,516 --> 02:36:25,900
追求尽可能高的目标

4509
02:36:26,466 --> 02:36:26,950
为什么呢

4510
02:36:27,433 --> 02:36:30,283
因为前进时的快感更大

4511
02:36:30,366 --> 02:36:31,900
现在 你必须平衡这一点

4512
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:35,416
你必须前进 对吧

4513
02:36:35,466 --> 02:36:37,250
因为想象一下奖励有两个组成部分

4514
02:36:37,700 --> 02:36:40,566
第一 你正朝着有价值的东西前进

4515
02:36:41,566 --> 02:36:44,833
好的 所以你希望它尽可能有价值 对吧

4516
02:36:44,916 --> 02:36:49,033
但你必须在移动 所以它不能太有价值以至于超出你的达到范围

4517
02:36:49,033 --> 02:36:50,050
你不能步行到月球

4518
02:36:50,133 --> 02:36:53,216
我无法看到我所做的每一步进展

4519
02:36:53,366 --> 02:36:56,383
是的 你想去月球 没错

4520
02:36:56,450 --> 02:36:58,100
你不能步行去那里 所以这是个糟糕的计划

4521
02:36:58,733 --> 02:37:02,316
你需要一个极其有价值的东西 你可以朝着它前进

4522
02:37:02,866 --> 02:37:12,016
好的 所以你与上帝建立关系的部分原因 比方说 是因为这设定了你愿景的上限

4523
02:37:12,616 --> 02:37:15,433
就像 我希望事情能达到最好的状态

4524
02:37:15,750 --> 02:37:16,850
那是天堂的愿景

4525
02:37:17,333 --> 02:37:21,666
好吧 这必须分解为你的近期决策

4526
02:37:22,216 --> 02:37:28,783
但在背后应该有这种持续的朝着你所说的 一个你接近时会消失的天堂的运动

4527
02:37:29,416 --> 02:37:30,966
那是对天堂的正确看法

4528
02:37:31,050 --> 02:37:36,883
天堂是一个完美的地方 并且同时变得更好的地方

4529
02:37:36,933 --> 02:37:42,766
这就是音乐给你展示的 因为一首伟大的音乐作品是完美的 但随着它的展开 它只会变得更好

4530
02:37:43,700 --> 02:37:44,450
你需要那个

4531
02:37:44,733 --> 02:37:49,583
这是静态乌托邦愿景的一部分问题 杜斯妥也夫斯基批评了这一点

4532
02:37:50,166 --> 02:37:53,500
如果你只给人们满足性奖励

4533
02:37:54,050 --> 02:38:03,116
他说 以至于他们除了坐在热水浴缸里、吃蛋糕、忙于物种的延续外 什么也做不了

4534
02:38:03,766 --> 02:38:08,716
人类会立刻将所有这些打破 只是为了有趣的事情可做

4535
02:38:09,033 --> 02:38:12,550
你几年前在罗根节目上说过什么来着

4536
02:38:14,300 --> 02:38:20,833
如果我们使世界变得足够完美 唯一渴望的就是渴望本身的缺失

4537
02:38:20,933 --> 02:38:21,200
那是什么

4538
02:38:21,800 --> 02:38:22,583
那是什么

4539
02:38:22,650 --> 02:38:23,416
那是克尔凯郭尔的观点

4540
02:38:23,433 --> 02:38:24,266
正确的说法是什么 你还记得吗

4541
02:38:24,266 --> 02:38:34,900
是的 克尔凯郭尔指出 随着我们使世界变得越来越容易 这也许是手头物质丰富的一部分问题

4542
02:38:35,433 --> 02:38:39,516
在某个时刻 变得缺乏的就是缺乏本身

4543
02:38:39,816 --> 02:38:40,283
是的 是的

4544
02:38:40,650 --> 02:38:41,916
对 没错 正是如此

4545
02:38:42,066 --> 02:38:48,333
这是最佳的剥夺 你知道 如果一切都被端上餐盘交给你 那你到底在那儿干嘛

4546
02:38:48,700 --> 02:38:50,366
这在亚伯拉罕的故事中发生过

4547
02:38:51,966 --> 02:38:54,466
所以亚伯拉罕 是诸国之父 对吧

4548
02:38:54,550 --> 02:38:55,850
所以亚伯拉罕做对了

4549
02:38:57,100 --> 02:38:59,083
他在故事开始时就拥有一切

4550
02:39:00,250 --> 02:39:01,250
他有富裕的父母

4551
02:39:03,216 --> 02:39:04,716
他没有必须做的事情

4552
02:39:05,750 --> 02:39:07,800
故事开始时他大约70岁

4553
02:39:08,200 --> 02:39:10,800
他一生都被手把手照顾

4554
02:39:11,800 --> 02:39:18,483
然后上帝的声音来到他那里 说 我是你祖先的上帝 告诉你离开你的舒适区

4555
02:39:19,116 --> 02:39:21,700
走向世界 那时亚伯拉罕已经相当老了

4556
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:26,733
但不知何故 他决定放弃舒适

4557
02:39:27,850 --> 02:39:37,383
选择冒险 然后随着亚伯拉罕的前进 他做出了所需的牺牲 随着他的提升 每次都变得更难

4558
02:39:37,416 --> 02:39:44,916
他采纳了与呼唤他冒险的上帝建立关系的模式 这实际上使他成为了诸国之父

4559
02:39:44,950 --> 02:39:50,250
所以你甚至可以从生物学的角度考虑这一点 你也可以这么做

4560
02:39:50,300 --> 02:40:01,033
像道金斯这样的人认为繁殖是性 这就是为什么他能够谈论自私的基因通过性表现出来

4561
02:40:01,033 --> 02:40:04,000
繁殖不是性

4562
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:07,716
性是生殖的必要条件 但不是充分条件

4563
02:40:08,733 --> 02:40:13,633
亚伯拉罕采纳了一个做某事的动机 一个牺牲的做某事的动机

4564
02:40:14,116 --> 02:40:17,400
这为他的儿子们创造了最佳环境

4565
02:40:18,233 --> 02:40:22,950
然后他的儿子们为他们的儿子 以及他们的儿子和他们的儿子创造了最佳环境

4566
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:24,766
所以你可以想象亚伯拉罕所做的

4567
02:40:25,150 --> 02:40:34,500
这个故事的意思是 他采纳了一个在考虑所有因素后几代人中都最有效的做某事的动机

4568
02:40:34,900 --> 02:40:36,633
并且他为此牺牲了一切

4569
02:40:37,033 --> 02:40:39,216
这是一种非常宏大的视野

4570
02:40:39,633 --> 02:40:50,000
鉴于我们生活在一个舒适的世界 并且我们创建了一些建筑 在这些建筑中有重物需要你拿起来然后放回原处

4571
02:40:50,333 --> 02:40:53,783
因为你必须拿起重物的情况实在太少了 对吧

4572
02:40:53,800 --> 02:40:54,300
对 对

4573
02:40:54,633 --> 02:40:55,100
增殖-

4574
02:40:55,450 --> 02:40:56,866
我们在道路上设置减速带也是出于同样的原因

4575
02:40:56,966 --> 02:41:02,816
冰浴和桑拿的普及 甚至在某种程度上阅读

4576
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:07,033
阅读困难的东西 人们应该去哪里

4577
02:41:07,533 --> 02:41:12,333
鉴于他们生活在一个比以往任何时候都更舒适的世界

4578
02:41:13,333 --> 02:41:16,366
他们应该去哪里激励他们寻找困难的事物

4579
02:41:16,400 --> 02:41:16,700
真相

4580
02:41:19,516 --> 02:41:21,133
真相是最佳的困难

4581
02:41:22,333 --> 02:41:23,750
真相是最佳的困难

4582
02:41:24,766 --> 02:41:26,200
这是非常美妙的事情

4583
02:41:26,933 --> 02:41:27,933
真相是冒险

4584
02:41:29,550 --> 02:41:33,600
没有区别 部分原因是因为

4585
02:41:33,883 --> 02:41:37,433
如果你只是说出你认为是真的 你必须放弃后果

4586
02:41:38,016 --> 02:41:39,216
你无法预测后果

4587
02:41:40,233 --> 02:41:44,983
那么 无法预测后果和拥有一次冒险之间没有区别

4588
02:41:45,766 --> 02:41:47,400
它们是同一件事 对吧

4589
02:41:47,500 --> 02:41:49,883
因为如果你知道了后果 那就不是一次冒险

4590
02:41:49,900 --> 02:41:53,533
如果后果是早已确定的 那就不是一次冒险

4591
02:41:53,616 --> 02:41:56,750
就像如果没有风险 就没有牺牲或勇气一样

4592
02:41:57,100 --> 02:41:58,500
对 对 对

4593
02:41:59,400 --> 02:42:00,400
完全一样

4594
02:42:01,333 --> 02:42:07,816
所以 知道在真相中可以找到最佳的冒险是一件美妙的事情

4595
02:42:08,800 --> 02:42:10,400
在每一个给定的情况下思考

4596
02:42:11,116 --> 02:42:18,050
所以基督在山上的讲道中说 要正确地定位自己 这通常被视为这种嬉皮笑脸

4597
02:42:18,616 --> 02:42:20,100
不要考虑道德

4598
02:42:20,200 --> 02:42:21,683
道德会自行解决

4599
02:42:22,116 --> 02:42:23,716
你知道 上帝照顾麻雀

4600
02:42:23,750 --> 02:42:24,933
他肯定也会照顾你

4601
02:42:25,250 --> 02:42:27,133
这就像一个嬉皮士的美梦

4602
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:31,566
但 这不是信息的核心

4603
02:42:32,066 --> 02:42:34,000
信息的核心非常直接

4604
02:42:34,533 --> 02:42:38,550
基督说 向你能想象到的最高事物瞄准

4605
02:42:38,966 --> 02:42:40,816
所以那是与上帝的关系

4606
02:42:41,250 --> 02:42:45,716
你正确地将最重要的事物置于顶峰 并且瞄准那个目标

4607
02:42:46,650 --> 02:42:55,900
然后你集中精力 正是这样 以及像你希望别人对待你自己那样对待其他人

4608
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:57,183
这设定了道德框架

4609
02:42:57,766 --> 02:43:01,700
然后你关注、关切当下

4610
02:43:02,133 --> 02:43:09,966
就像一旦你建立了正确的道德框架 你就会关注当下 并且活在真实中 这会引领你向目的地前进

4611
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:11,600
你必须有正确的方向感

4612
02:43:11,616 --> 02:43:12,500
你必须向上瞄准

4613
02:43:12,966 --> 02:43:16,633
但那只是一件事情 你会怎么说呢

4614
02:43:17,050 --> 02:43:18,133
遵守真理

4615
02:43:18,233 --> 02:43:21,150
那就是让人们自由的理性 这是正确的

4616
02:43:21,416 --> 02:43:22,833
正确地做 对吧

4617
02:43:23,066 --> 02:43:28,916
还有另一个规则没有写进你的书 没有什么好事是微不足道的

4618
02:43:29,300 --> 02:43:30,816
对 对 对 对

4619
02:43:31,050 --> 02:43:32,166
是的 嗯 你积累

4620
02:43:32,516 --> 02:43:41,566
所以基督在福音书中告诉他的追随者要在天堂积累财宝 而不是在蛀虫和锈蚀能破坏的地方

4621
02:43:42,133 --> 02:43:43,300
那么 这是什么意思呢

4622
02:43:44,266 --> 02:43:54,866
嗯 这和你刚才指出的意思一样 意思是如果你让自己经历一个纪律过程 所以你完成了某件事

4623
02:43:54,950 --> 02:43:57,916
也许你没有达到你瞄准的目标

4624
02:43:58,316 --> 02:44:02,000
但你积累了一种新的看待世界的方式和一套技能

4625
02:44:02,450 --> 02:44:06,883
嗯 如果你只是继续做那些事情 你就会有多种看待世界的方式和更多的技能

4626
02:44:07,266 --> 02:44:10,433
嗯 那就是你的财宝库

4627
02:44:10,750 --> 02:44:19,733
你知道 女性将财富作为吸引力的表征是因为财富是能力的表征

4628
02:44:20,633 --> 02:44:23,700
但它不是能力 因为你可以富有而无用

4629
02:44:23,800 --> 02:44:26,650
现在 这并不容易 但至少可能是暂时的

4630
02:44:27,216 --> 02:44:30,966
但女性使用财富的标志来评估能力

4631
02:44:31,400 --> 02:44:34,183
能力才是宝藏 财富不是宝藏

4632
02:44:35,033 --> 02:44:38,950
因为如果你有能力 你即使被扔进沙漠也能让它开花

4633
02:44:39,333 --> 02:44:41,283
我已经说过去健身房的人是这样的

4634
02:44:41,600 --> 02:44:46,016
所以从外表来看 一个去健身房并且身材不错的人 关键是身材

4635
02:44:46,050 --> 02:44:49,500
这就是你在亲密时能触碰到的

4636
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:59,983
但我认为 一个身材好的人所讲述的关于他们是什么样的人的故事 比身体的外在表现更为重要

4637
02:45:00,066 --> 02:45:04,933
这是一个可靠的人 能够克服困难 自律的人

4638
02:45:05,150 --> 02:45:13,016
是的 这是一长串他们能够处理痛苦和不适的事物清单 这在某种程度上是有吸引力的

4639
02:45:14,566 --> 02:45:20,300
这是完美的 是完美的物质主义纪律策略 对吧 因为它非常具体

4640
02:45:20,733 --> 02:45:21,716
你改变了你的身体

4641
02:45:22,050 --> 02:45:23,900
就像 这是一种精神追求吗

4642
02:45:24,033 --> 02:45:29,283
嗯 它是在需要长期的纪律和牺牲的情况下是的

4643
02:45:29,816 --> 02:45:36,883
你可能希望 我认为这是可能的 你知道 你可能会陷入身体自我提升的小圈子

4644
02:45:38,416 --> 02:45:44,866
并且过于痴迷地专注于此 但你也可以将其作为走向纪律追求本身的垫脚石

4645
02:45:44,966 --> 02:45:46,133
许多人都这样做

4646
02:45:46,300 --> 02:45:51,566
我想我上次和你聊天时告诉你关于“男性更年期” 这个我提出的概念

4647
02:45:51,616 --> 02:45:59,350
所以我注意到在我20多岁末期 很多一直以特定方式训练的人

4648
02:45:59,366 --> 02:46:04,566
通常是健身 通常仅仅为了他们的外表 他们意识到当他们接近30岁时

4649
02:46:04,566 --> 02:46:09,666
也许上楼梯时会喘不过气来 也许连脚趾都碰不到（柔韧性很差） 但他们外表看起来似乎非常棒

4650
02:46:10,133 --> 02:46:14,383
但不 他们只是感觉他们应该开始重视不同的事物

4651
02:46:14,750 --> 02:46:22,483
然后他们改变了他们的训练方式 他们会去练巴西柔术、瑜伽、CrossFit或其他形式的锻炼

4652
02:46:23,116 --> 02:46:27,500
这促使一切其他事物都发生了变化

4653
02:46:27,666 --> 02:46:29,333
我在自己身上也看到了这一点 对吧

4654
02:46:29,500 --> 02:46:35,583
我快到30岁时 我已经以社会告诉一个年轻人应该珍视的方式取得了成功

4655
02:46:35,966 --> 02:46:37,883
有种不协调感 某些东西感觉不对劲

4656
02:46:38,550 --> 02:46:48,433
然后你会想 好吧 也许我需要评估一下 我被告知应该想要的东西是否真的是我想要的

4657
02:46:49,316 --> 02:46:53,183
很快你就会意识到 我不知道 感觉像是一场四分之一生命危机

4658
02:46:53,250 --> 02:46:54,666
我认为很多男性都经历过这种情况

4659
02:46:55,066 --> 02:47:01,600
他们说 我在一款被告知应该重视的游戏中要么成功 要么没有成功

4660
02:47:02,233 --> 02:47:04,783
但经过反思 我发现我并不像我以为的那样在乎它

4661
02:47:05,416 --> 02:47:10,083
也许有些方面 我为我和我的商业伙伴所做的事情感到非常自豪 我为我们取得的成就感到非常自豪

4662
02:47:10,800 --> 02:47:15,333
但然后有些其他的东西 我在想 我为什么把我的自我价值感这么多地寄托在这个和那个上

4663
02:47:16,900 --> 02:47:19,600
然后你必须开始评估

4664
02:47:19,600 --> 02:47:24,166
所以这就是在出埃及记的故事中 摩西遇见燃烧的灌木丛时发生的事情

4665
02:47:25,633 --> 02:47:29,416
所以他只是作为一个牧羊人正常地忙着他的事务 他过得还不错

4666
02:47:29,433 --> 02:47:30,666
他有两个妻子

4667
02:47:30,666 --> 02:47:31,400
他喜欢他的岳父

4668
02:47:31,800 --> 02:47:34,650
在他所在的这个新国家他受到了好评

4669
02:47:35,033 --> 02:47:42,450
他离开了埃及 在那里他基本上因为杀死一个折磨希伯来人的埃及人而被悬赏

4670
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:47,683
无论如何 摩西只是作为一个牧羊人正常地忙着他的事务 那时候这是一份非常艰难的工作

4671
02:47:48,266 --> 02:47:52,283
然后这件事引起了他的注意 这一闪光 这一光泽

4672
02:47:52,666 --> 02:47:53,700
他去调查了

4673
02:47:53,800 --> 02:47:54,933
好吧 那意味着什么

4674
02:47:55,216 --> 02:47:58,333
这意味着当你在生活中前进时 某些东西会引起你的兴趣

4675
02:47:58,766 --> 02:48:02,416
在你刚才讲的故事中 就像有人决定他们要开始去健身房

4676
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:08,250
有些关于变得身体健康的东西对他们来说很有吸引力 对吧

4677
02:48:08,300 --> 02:48:09,533
这是一件有趣的事情 对吧

4678
02:48:09,600 --> 02:48:10,483
因为它吸引了他们

4679
02:48:11,100 --> 02:48:18,400
这甚至不一定是他们做出的决定 更像是一种展现出来的、有趣的可能性

4680
02:48:18,933 --> 02:48:20,250
所以他们决定去追求它

4681
02:48:20,333 --> 02:48:21,783
所以他们更深入地研究它

4682
02:48:21,900 --> 02:48:26,333
所以 摩西走近燃烧的灌木丛 越来越近

4683
02:48:26,366 --> 02:48:29,683
而且灌木丛是生命的象征 对吧

4684
02:48:30,033 --> 02:48:31,600
就像它是一棵树 生命之树

4685
02:48:32,266 --> 02:48:39,250
而一棵燃烧的生命之树 那是存在（生命之树） 以及变成（火 变化）

4686
02:48:39,333 --> 02:48:42,700
所以燃烧的灌木丛是存在和变成的象征

4687
02:48:43,150 --> 02:48:44,333
现在它是某个召唤

4688
02:48:44,800 --> 02:48:48,250
好吧 所以现在你追求你的体能 因为它召唤了你

4689
02:48:48,616 --> 02:48:51,100
你越来越专注于它 你变得越来越有纪律

4690
02:48:51,150 --> 02:48:54,933
但随着你变得越来越有纪律 你开始转变

4691
02:48:55,316 --> 02:48:56,983
所以你的视野开始变化

4692
02:48:57,100 --> 02:49:01,566
现在 当摩西越来越接近燃烧的灌木丛时

4693
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,150
他开始意识到他站在神圣的土地上

4694
02:49:04,600 --> 02:49:05,566
所以他走得更深

4695
02:49:05,966 --> 02:49:07,583
这次调查让他走得更深

4696
02:49:07,633 --> 02:49:10,600
所以他脱下鞋子 继续靠近

4697
02:49:10,700 --> 02:49:12,750
他仍然走在同一条路上

4698
02:49:12,833 --> 02:49:13,666
追寻这个东西

4699
02:49:14,033 --> 02:49:17,833
然后上帝的声音本身从燃烧的灌木丛中对他说话

4700
02:49:18,350 --> 02:49:19,883
那是什么让他成为了一个领袖

4701
02:49:20,450 --> 02:49:21,966
那么这个故事意味着什么

4702
02:49:22,150 --> 02:49:26,833
这意味着当你以正常模式穿行于生活中时 事物会召唤你

4703
02:49:27,916 --> 02:49:30,700
如果你追寻它们 它们会带你深入

4704
02:49:30,816 --> 02:49:32,666
召唤你的具体是什么并不真的重要

4705
02:49:33,050 --> 02:49:38,233
重要的是你追寻它 并且深入地追寻它

4706
02:49:38,666 --> 02:49:42,583
当你深入地追寻它时 你会发生转变

4707
02:49:42,650 --> 02:49:45,116
如果你毫无保留地这样做

4708
02:49:45,500 --> 02:49:51,550
那会让你成为那个解放奴隶和反对暴君的人

4709
02:49:52,133 --> 02:49:53,300
这就是它的工作方式

4710
02:49:54,133 --> 02:49:54,933
那是召唤

4711
02:49:55,916 --> 02:50:00,266
几乎任何方向都可能发生这种情况

4712
02:50:01,833 --> 02:50:05,900
你只需要带着足够的信念去追寻它

4713
02:50:07,566 --> 02:50:14,833
目前几乎每个人都在很多方面贬低大学教育 这是其中的一件事

4714
02:50:15,600 --> 02:50:23,466
我在大学的时光非常有趣 几乎完全在教育之外

4715
02:50:23,566 --> 02:50:29,000
我在纽卡斯尔度过的五年里 所有好事都与我所学的无关

4716
02:50:29,150 --> 02:50:30,700
它从来不在讲堂里发生

4717
02:50:30,866 --> 02:50:32,316
它是我在那之外做的一切

4718
02:50:32,900 --> 02:50:40,016
我的很多朋友--在互联网上 嘲笑高等教育是无用的纸片是非常流行的

4719
02:50:40,900 --> 02:50:43,750
这不是说 你不需要它就能成功

4720
02:50:43,833 --> 02:50:45,583
这当然是我最终所做的事情

4721
02:50:45,633 --> 02:50:48,883
这个播客不需要我上大学 但也许在某些方面需要

4722
02:50:49,516 --> 02:50:53,066
但从资格的角度来看 显然不需要

4723
02:50:53,900 --> 02:50:58,866
但我认为我仍然相对支持大学经历

4724
02:51:01,666 --> 02:51:05,533
是的 你即将推出的彼得森学院是你的新项目

4725
02:51:06,550 --> 02:51:18,600
我想知道你怎么看 基本上 大学还有救吗 考虑到大学体验中那么多好的东西几乎与教育本身无关

4726
02:51:21,350 --> 02:51:22,366
它们还有救吗

4727
02:51:23,450 --> 02:51:24,533
有些可能有救

4728
02:51:27,033 --> 02:51:29,350
希尔斯代尔做得很好

4729
02:51:29,516 --> 02:51:30,333
那是什么

4730
02:51:30,350 --> 02:51:40,366
它是位于美国东北部的一个保守派学院 由拉里·阿恩运营 他们的辍学率为1% 相对于典型的50%辍学率

4731
02:51:42,116 --> 02:51:49,466
他们提供经典的 过去的自由艺术教育

4732
02:51:50,466 --> 02:51:55,183
考虑到奥弗顿窗口的变化 这是一个更保守的企业

4733
02:51:55,816 --> 02:52:00,750
但拉里的学生专注于体能训练

4734
02:52:01,433 --> 02:52:06,816
他的哲学系倾向于在健身房开会 这很有趣

4735
02:52:07,216 --> 02:52:09,466
他在校园里到处都摆放了举重凳

4736
02:52:09,633 --> 02:52:13,466
大约三分之一的学生上音乐课程 所以这个地方非常有音乐氛围

4737
02:52:15,016 --> 02:52:16,300
这是一个非常有纪律的地方

4738
02:52:16,850 --> 02:52:19,083
教育质量极高

4739
02:52:19,516 --> 02:52:24,016
所以有些机构仍坚守他们的使命

4740
02:52:25,266 --> 02:52:33,350
我认为这很罕见 而且我认为总体上 大学已经不可救药地腐败了 据我所知

4741
02:52:34,150 --> 02:52:44,866
所以我们希望我们能提供一个近似的替代方案 但你指出了其中的一个复杂性

4742
02:52:46,033 --> 02:52:54,766
人们容易认为大学是知识从专家传递给空白容器 也就是学生的过程

4743
02:52:54,916 --> 02:52:58,350
所以它是讲座、考试和认证

4744
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:02,450
但这并不真正是大学的全部

4745
02:53:02,600 --> 02:53:03,566
它是一种学徒制

4746
02:53:04,150 --> 02:53:10,466
如果你幸运的话 当你上大学时 你会找到一两位教授可以合作 他们真正教你如何思考

4747
02:53:12,233 --> 02:53:18,416
这些教授通常很少见 如果你确立了这样的关系 你是幸运的

4748
02:53:18,766 --> 02:53:24,383
特别是在大学里 学生和教师的比例高得离谱 比如200比1

4749
02:53:25,016 --> 02:53:26,316
我在的讲堂里有300比1的情况

4750
02:53:27,050 --> 02:53:27,583
对 对

4751
02:53:27,816 --> 02:53:29,666
我和我的任何一位教授都没有建立起这样的关系

4752
02:53:30,616 --> 02:53:38,100
对 对 这真的不好 因为你需要一种学徒关系来基本上获得教育

4753
02:53:39,500 --> 02:53:42,633
我们开始了这个 我们正在构思彼得森学院

4754
02:53:43,333 --> 02:53:49,200
我们希望我们能为人们提供极高质量的讲座

4755
02:53:49,833 --> 02:53:56,366
我很幸运 就像你一样 能够接触到那些有魅力且受过良好教育的人

4756
02:53:56,900 --> 02:54:05,900
我们为他们提供了好的财务协议 我们非常好地对待他们 他们来到迈阿密并录制一系列相对短的讲座系列 八小时

4757
02:54:05,933 --> 02:54:19,533
我们正在实施最先进的测试程序 我们将颁发一张你必须努力获得的证书

4758
02:54:19,533 --> 02:54:31,416
所以我们希望我们的毕业生的质量能够表明这个证书本身就是尽责和受过教育的专业知识的标志

4759
02:54:31,950 --> 02:54:32,450
我们拭目以待

4760
02:54:33,233 --> 02:54:37,750
我们也在构建它的社交方面 因为正如你指出的

4761
02:54:38,166 --> 02:54:43,516
你上大学时发生的很大一部分是社交和社会化

4762
02:54:44,850 --> 02:54:47,883
你会交到一整群新朋友

4763
02:54:48,550 --> 02:54:49,550
这很重要

4764
02:54:49,566 --> 02:54:56,333
这是巨大的 这是你生命中的那些时刻之一 你可以划分你过去的自我 并且可以成为新的自己

4765
02:54:56,400 --> 02:55:05,816
每个夏天 至少对我来说 也许是因为我在学校里长期不受欢迎 我每次回来都想象自己能够重新塑造自己

4766
02:55:05,966 --> 02:55:07,283
我今年会成为酷孩子

4767
02:55:07,300 --> 02:55:09,050
我今年会成为运动型孩子 或者 不管什么

4768
02:55:09,433 --> 02:55:14,700
但最大的转变是18岁 因为你甚至不在同一个城市

4769
02:55:15,100 --> 02:55:15,866
没有人知道你是谁

4770
02:55:15,933 --> 02:55:17,916
没有人知道该如何看待你

4771
02:55:18,766 --> 02:55:28,283
对我来说 那是我从我曾经的孩子变成即将成为的年轻成年人的一个重大转折点

4772
02:55:28,366 --> 02:55:29,083
对 对

4773
02:55:29,200 --> 02:55:36,883
如果你幸运的话 你的生命中会有几次这样的机会 你可以彻底转变 并全新地定义自己

4774
02:55:37,816 --> 02:55:39,133
这就是 我想在这插一句

4775
02:55:39,133 --> 02:55:39,266
是的

4776
02:55:41,116 --> 02:55:46,183
有一个被称为“僧侣模式”的概念 在线上有点成为了一个模因 但我几年前就首次读到了这个

4777
02:55:46,816 --> 02:55:58,300
它涉及到一个长时间的孤立期来研究自己 反思自己的缺点 进行内心的工作 自省

4778
02:55:59,800 --> 02:56:07,400
它通常与冥想、改善饮食、提高身体健康、心理健康等各个方面联系在一起

4779
02:56:08,116 --> 02:56:13,033
我几乎将其视为做这件事

4780
02:56:14,666 --> 02:56:21,183
并在短时间内专注于自己 这是非常 非常的 可能就是几个月时间真正专注于自己

4781
02:56:21,250 --> 02:56:26,500
仍然继续工作和做其他事情 但除此之外 真的非常努力地使自己尽可能变得更好

4782
02:56:26,916 --> 02:56:33,600
对我来说 定期这样做是除了生活方式改变外最有力的转折之一

4783
02:56:34,650 --> 02:56:37,583
这本质上就是告解的意义所在

4784
02:56:38,766 --> 02:56:42,033
我的意思是 当你自我反省 你进行告解

4785
02:56:43,350 --> 02:56:45,166
你对自己进行告解

4786
02:56:49,916 --> 02:56:52,033
你使你的罪孽成为现实

4787
02:56:53,366 --> 02:56:57,733
你对自己的不足进行评估 并宣布你的不足

4788
02:56:58,333 --> 02:57:05,550
这样你就可以开始着手解决它们了 这很痛苦 这是我所有的不足

4789
02:57:05,583 --> 02:57:11,283
这是我所有的不足 我希望成为的那些 对 这是痛苦的自我检查

4790
02:57:11,300 --> 02:57:22,800
但优势是你可以将所有问题摆到桌面上 这样做的优势是 逐个问题地 很可能有希望

4791
02:57:22,833 --> 02:57:30,200
例如 你说你青少年时期不受欢迎 但这并不意味着你必须将这种情况带入大学 对吧

4792
02:57:30,250 --> 02:57:33,566
有一种可能性 那么你是如何摆脱那种状态的

4793
02:57:34,033 --> 02:57:34,616
你做了什么

4794
02:57:36,100 --> 02:57:41,133
我认为主要原因是我不太懂得如何与其他孩子相处

4795
02:57:41,633 --> 02:57:49,300
所以我发现自己对其他孩子穿衬衫的方式、打领带的方式或他们穿的鞋子类型过于关注

4796
02:57:49,566 --> 02:57:53,266
对 所以你在寻找外在的模型或归属的标志

4797
02:57:53,283 --> 02:57:55,383
是的 这就是为什么他们有朋友而我没有

4798
02:57:55,750 --> 02:57:55,950
对

4799
02:57:56,500 --> 02:57:58,216
我没有意识到 这只是

4800
02:57:59,500 --> 02:58:05,300
我在社交上不太灵巧 我不太懂得如何与其他孩子很好地相处

4801
02:58:06,033 --> 02:58:09,900
我认为我到了上大学的时候

4802
02:58:10,533 --> 02:58:19,950
我已经花了足够的时间至少学会了一些粗糙的社交技巧

4803
02:58:20,516 --> 02:58:28,166
现在终于能够摆脱一些可能一直跟随我的既定假设了

4804
02:58:29,016 --> 02:58:29,250
因为-

4805
02:58:29,800 --> 02:58:30,916
对你来说是什么开启了这一点

4806
02:58:31,100 --> 02:58:34,000
比如 你还记得你在大学里结交的第一个朋友吗

4807
02:58:34,533 --> 02:58:35,750
哦是的 我和一起生活的那些家伙们

4808
02:58:36,100 --> 02:58:36,250
所以-

4809
02:58:36,833 --> 02:58:37,800
好吧 那么这些是室友吗

4810
02:58:37,916 --> 02:58:38,450
是的 是的 是的

4811
02:58:38,750 --> 02:58:39,533
好吧 所以是的 那是一个很好的

4812
02:58:39,816 --> 02:58:42,250
看 这是一件很难在网上复制的事情 对吧

4813
02:58:42,350 --> 02:58:48,566
因为有一群室友是一种形成性的经历

4814
02:58:48,600 --> 02:58:49,250
对我来说疯狂

4815
02:58:49,450 --> 02:58:54,300
我不知道 因为再次 我是独生子女 和两个父母住在一个小房子里

4816
02:58:55,233 --> 02:58:58,533
我不知道你应该在进入某人的卧室前敲门

4817
02:58:59,033 --> 02:58:59,866
我从来没这么做过

4818
02:59:00,233 --> 02:59:00,866
我已经18年了

4819
02:59:01,716 --> 02:59:03,650
我从来没有需要敲过任何人的卧室门

4820
02:59:03,766 --> 02:59:06,016
就像 爸爸妈妈在楼下 还有谁呢

4821
02:59:06,350 --> 02:59:10,433
我会敲狗的 比如厨房门看狗狗们是否介意我进入厨房

4822
02:59:11,800 --> 02:59:16,816
回想起来 现在看来 不知道那是你应该做的事情 真是太荒谬了

4823
02:59:16,950 --> 02:59:20,783
是的 不知道那些基本技能 那可能是一个巨大的障碍

4824
02:59:21,133 --> 02:59:28,483
我在我的临床实践中有人 我们花了几个小时练习如何介绍他们自己和握手

4825
02:59:29,316 --> 02:59:30,500
因为你想在这方面成为专家

4826
02:59:31,650 --> 02:59:35,633
因为如果你在这方面一点都不擅长 比如如果你真的很糟糕 你就麻烦了

4827
02:59:36,983 --> 02:59:38,350
你甚至无法告诉别人你的名字

4828
02:59:38,766 --> 02:59:40,033
那你怎么交朋友呢

4829
02:59:41,150 --> 02:59:44,583
你的第一步就宣告你自己无能

4830
02:59:45,033 --> 02:59:48,300
然后如果这样的事情发生了10次 你就会非常害怕

4831
02:59:48,333 --> 02:59:49,083
失去动力

4832
02:59:49,400 --> 02:59:51,000
哦天哪 非常非常地

4833
02:59:51,366 --> 02:59:52,933
所以你应该在这方面成为专家

4834
02:59:53,333 --> 02:59:57,466
这是你可以对孩子们做的事情之一 这样他们可以在自我介绍方面变得专业

4835
02:59:58,866 --> 03:00:01,150
握手时要稍微用力一点

4836
03:00:01,533 --> 03:00:03,866
看着对方 尝试微笑

4837
03:00:04,616 --> 03:00:07,500
你知道 尝试与对方的节奏匹配

4838
03:00:08,916 --> 03:00:14,133
最近我一直在思考的另一个动态 几个月前我在洛杉矶的一个静修中

4839
03:00:14,500 --> 03:00:19,716
其中一位在场的人说他停止了在互联网上的谈论和写作

4840
03:00:20,433 --> 03:00:23,233
因为他注意到他在公众中讲述的故事

4841
03:00:24,250 --> 03:00:27,250
他开始感觉有必要在私下里实践

4842
03:00:28,300 --> 03:00:41,466
我认为无论你是作家还是仅仅是在Instagram上有500个关注者和一个旧Facebook账号的普通人 人们展示了一个在线形象

4843
03:00:41,483 --> 03:00:47,983
然后他们几乎感觉这个形象比真实的自己更真实 然后他们尝试逆向工程自己以适应这个新的 这是-

4844
03:00:48,016 --> 03:00:52,516
写下你的教授想听到的内容的问题所在

4845
03:00:52,600 --> 03:00:54,816
你不能在不改变你的灵魂的情况下做到这一点

4846
03:00:55,266 --> 03:00:55,983
你不能这样做

4847
03:00:56,400 --> 03:01:06,916
你不能为自己构建一个假的形象 旨在从世界上提取资源 而不让这成为你的一部分

4848
03:01:08,866 --> 03:01:10,250
没有人那么精明

4849
03:01:10,550 --> 03:01:12,633
没有人可以拥有两个这样的自我

4850
03:01:13,200 --> 03:01:21,966
这就是为什么你必须非常小心你所说和所做的原因 是因为当你练习虚假时 你变得虚假

4851
03:01:24,600 --> 03:01:27,083
这不仅仅是你头脑中的信念

4852
03:01:27,500 --> 03:01:32,266
你重新连接自己 所以你开始通过你的虚假框架字面上看待世界

4853
03:01:32,566 --> 03:01:34,100
这是一个非常糟糕的计划

4854
03:01:34,333 --> 03:01:37,650
我听你说过 如果你说话够久 你就会相信它们

4855
03:01:38,816 --> 03:01:40,950
你变成它们 这甚至比相信它们更糟

4856
03:01:41,133 --> 03:01:42,050
这比那更深入

4857
03:01:42,750 --> 03:01:46,666
它们作为不容置疑的隐含公理被构建进你

4858
03:01:46,900 --> 03:01:49,416
正如我们之前所说 这可以朝任何方向发展 对吧

4859
03:01:49,500 --> 03:01:57,933
你可以一小步一小步地假装直到你成功 朝着你知道是积极的愿景前进 并持续评估以确保你没有被劫持走错方向

4860
03:01:58,516 --> 03:01:58,750
是的

4861
03:02:01,783 --> 03:02:03,666
所以看 在《木偶奇遇记》电影中

4862
03:02:04,050 --> 03:02:06,516
我已经在迪士尼的《木偶奇遇记》电影中分析得死去活来了

4863
03:02:06,816 --> 03:02:07,983
你是木偶先生 是的

4864
03:02:08,300 --> 03:02:08,450
是的

4865
03:02:09,116 --> 03:02:10,183
世界领先的《木偶奇遇记》学者

4866
03:02:10,233 --> 03:02:12,166
所以木偶 确切地说 确切地说

4867
03:02:13,766 --> 03:02:19,133
木偶在努力摆脱那些从各个方向拉扯他的线

4868
03:02:19,500 --> 03:02:22,650
那些不受他控制的线 成为一些真实的东西

4869
03:02:23,316 --> 03:02:26,400
好吧 所以他面临着三个基本的诱惑

4870
03:02:27,800 --> 03:02:32,133
一个是撒谎 对吧

4871
03:02:32,233 --> 03:02:33,016
所以那是否定

4872
03:02:35,333 --> 03:02:36,500
另一个是成为一个演员

4873
03:02:37,216 --> 03:02:40,516
当我第一次在电影中遇到这一点时 我想 这到底是怎么回事

4874
03:02:41,133 --> 03:02:43,516
木偶的诱惑之一是成为一个演员

4875
03:02:43,566 --> 03:02:45,533
现在 为什么好莱坞的人要这么做呢

4876
03:02:45,633 --> 03:02:47,083
为什么他们要贬低演员呢

4877
03:02:47,133 --> 03:02:48,566
然后我想 哦 不是演员

4878
03:02:48,633 --> 03:02:49,700
它是一个虚假的人格

4879
03:02:50,266 --> 03:02:52,300
成为演员而不是真实的自己

4880
03:02:52,733 --> 03:02:54,850
成为表象而非现实

4881
03:02:54,950 --> 03:02:57,766
为了获得赞誉而不是付出努力 对吧

4882
03:02:57,833 --> 03:02:58,516
成为虚假的

4883
03:02:59,700 --> 03:03:01,566
下一个诱惑是变得神经质

4884
03:03:02,066 --> 03:03:09,216
特别是在我们现在的世界中 这些动画师是多么的有洞察力

4885
03:03:09,916 --> 03:03:14,200
木偶被一个假医生诱惑到快乐岛上

4886
03:03:14,800 --> 03:03:18,733
由一个诊断他患有他没有的疾病的假医生

4887
03:03:19,866 --> 03:03:22,950
故事是 看看你有多病

4888
03:03:23,766 --> 03:03:26,650
你工作太努力了 你需要去快乐岛

4889
03:03:26,766 --> 03:03:29,933
好吧 快乐岛是由奴隶主经营的 对吧

4890
03:03:30,700 --> 03:03:31,483
所以这很完美

4891
03:03:33,550 --> 03:03:36,983
要小心你的练习

4892
03:03:37,800 --> 03:03:39,333
要小心你的练习 对吧

4893
03:03:40,100 --> 03:03:44,233
你可以成为自己理想的演员 这是向前迈进的一种方式

4894
03:03:44,366 --> 03:03:51,500
但当你为了获得地位而对自己是谁作出虚假声明时

4895
03:03:52,916 --> 03:03:54,250
你在扭曲你的灵魂

4896
03:03:55,100 --> 03:03:55,866
灵魂是什么

4897
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:02,066
灵魂有点像是世界向你展现自己的结构

4898
03:04:02,550 --> 03:04:03,500
它有点像那样

4899
03:04:04,200 --> 03:04:05,650
所以你看不到很多世界 对吧

4900
03:04:05,716 --> 03:04:07,283
你通过狭窄的孔隙看到它

4901
03:04:07,733 --> 03:04:09,250
你看到你允许进入的东西

4902
03:04:09,400 --> 03:04:10,850
这是另一种思考方式

4903
03:04:11,550 --> 03:04:15,216
你最好确保它是世界的光明部分向你展示自己

4904
03:04:16,133 --> 03:04:18,066
如果你撒谎 情况就不会是这样的

4905
03:04:19,366 --> 03:04:27,050
我认为 许多听这个播客的人 当然还有我的许多聪明而理智的朋友们遇到的一个问题是

4906
03:04:28,516 --> 03:04:32,300
他们用思考来制造问题 并且努力使用他们的直觉

4907
03:04:32,916 --> 03:04:37,500
因为他们能够随时为他们应该或不应该做某事找到理由

4908
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:45,766
你知道 谈论灵魂或内心的声音或良心 或者 你可能称之为通过你的最佳自我显现的上帝

4909
03:04:47,600 --> 03:04:54,766
沉思和自省的人非常擅长说服自己做或不做某事 这感觉像他们的本能

4910
03:04:54,766 --> 03:04:56,150
这是因为他们崇拜智力

4911
03:04:57,566 --> 03:05:06,166
你会怎么建议那些喜欢深入思考事物的人 放下这种倾向 让他们能更清晰地听到自己的声音

4912
03:05:07,233 --> 03:05:09,800
注意力和智力之间有所不同

4913
03:05:13,116 --> 03:05:15,816
关注力值得一提

4914
03:05:16,700 --> 03:05:17,633
这不是同一回事

4915
03:05:17,700 --> 03:05:26,566
比如说 智力产生思想 注意力收集信息 对吧

4916
03:05:26,633 --> 03:05:27,400
所以如果我

4917
03:05:30,500 --> 03:05:32,933
好吧 如果我在进行一次播客

4918
03:05:33,833 --> 03:05:36,200
我在关注我不理解的东西

4919
03:05:37,416 --> 03:05:40,033
我不是在思考 这不是同一回事

4920
03:05:40,350 --> 03:05:49,416
我的意思是 有时我会思考 因为对方说的某些东西会引发一连串的思考 但通常我所做的就是 嗯 我理解你刚才说的了吗

4921
03:05:50,050 --> 03:05:51,000
这是关注力的问题

4922
03:05:51,100 --> 03:05:52,550
我必须注意到我的无知

4923
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:54,266
我在关注我的无知

4924
03:05:54,666 --> 03:05:56,700
罗根（Joe Rogan）擅长这个

4925
03:05:56,766 --> 03:05:57,750
你在这方面也很出色

4926
03:05:58,333 --> 03:06:00,766
如果你关注你的无知 那你就知道该做什么了

4927
03:06:01,216 --> 03:06:02,466
你只需要问问题

4928
03:06:02,650 --> 03:06:04,000
就像 嗯 我不理解这个

4929
03:06:04,750 --> 03:06:07,366
关注你的无知是一种谦卑的表现形式

4930
03:06:07,450 --> 03:06:11,733
那是那些崇拜路西法式智力的人应该做的事情

4931
03:06:12,216 --> 03:06:13,700
就是关注他们自己的无知

4932
03:06:14,233 --> 03:06:15,300
这不关乎你知道什么

4933
03:06:16,166 --> 03:06:17,250
这关乎你不知道什么

4934
03:06:17,850 --> 03:06:18,966
你已经知道你所知道的

4935
03:06:20,216 --> 03:06:22,116
那么为什么不探索你不知道的呢

4936
03:06:22,750 --> 03:06:23,533
好吧 你怎么做呢

4937
03:06:23,850 --> 03:06:25,016
你关注你的无知

4938
03:06:26,116 --> 03:06:28,283
谦卑的定义是什么

4939
03:06:28,716 --> 03:06:30,483
谦卑就是关注你的无知

4940
03:06:31,350 --> 03:06:32,700
你可以在任何地方做到这一点

4941
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:36,066
那不仍然是一个智力练习吗

4942
03:06:36,466 --> 03:06:41,633
这里是我所知道的空白 因此我会继续提问直到填补它们

4943
03:06:43,566 --> 03:06:54,383
嗯 这并不是完全脱离的 这是质疑和回答之间的区别

4944
03:06:56,550 --> 03:07:00,016
比如 我会说 这是 可以说 定义上的

4945
03:07:00,350 --> 03:07:02,900
路西法式智力有一个答案

4946
03:07:03,033 --> 03:07:05,316
当你说路西法式智力时 那是什么

4947
03:07:06,233 --> 03:07:10,200
路西法式智力是想要把自己置于最高位置的智力

4948
03:07:11,416 --> 03:07:17,600
很多聪明人倾向于路西法式 因为他们认为他们的基本价值在于他们的智力

4949
03:07:18,166 --> 03:07:20,600
他们认为智力是基本价值

4950
03:07:20,950 --> 03:07:23,900
然后 如果他们非常聪明却很恼火

4951
03:07:24,350 --> 03:07:29,716
世界没有向他们敞开 因为他们认为 我这么聪明 一切都应该朝我这边来

4952
03:07:30,666 --> 03:07:36,700
因为他们以此为傲 而智力上的傲慢 嗯 那可能是最大的罪恶

4953
03:07:37,416 --> 03:07:41,400
路西法式智力是想要将自己置于最高位置的智力

4954
03:07:41,500 --> 03:07:50,583
它挑战上帝 这就是撒旦是什么 这就是路西法是什么 字面上在弥尔顿的故事中 路西法是试图篡夺上帝地位的精神

4955
03:07:51,200 --> 03:07:52,616
这就是共产主义者所做的

4956
03:07:52,833 --> 03:07:54,166
这就是法西斯分子所做的

4957
03:07:54,250 --> 03:07:56,283
这就是我们建造巴别塔时所做的

4958
03:07:57,166 --> 03:08:01,700
我们很容易将智力提升到最高的位置 尤其是聪明人

4959
03:08:01,750 --> 03:08:02,666
他们一直在这么做

4960
03:08:03,366 --> 03:08:05,733
最好是关注你所不知道的

4961
03:08:06,216 --> 03:08:10,466
这就是为什么罗根是一个很好的例子 因为罗根不是一个知识分子

4962
03:08:12,116 --> 03:08:13,133
他是一个探索者

4963
03:08:14,216 --> 03:08:15,300
这不是同一回事

4964
03:08:16,133 --> 03:08:19,083
罗根总是像一只寻血猎犬

4965
03:08:19,150 --> 03:08:20,716
他在追寻他所不知道的路径上

4966
03:08:21,433 --> 03:08:23,583
因此 他知道的很多

4967
03:08:24,016 --> 03:08:25,916
你知道 2000个播客 2500个播客

4968
03:08:27,100 --> 03:08:31,833
他做了像2500个高级研究生研讨会之类的东西

4969
03:08:32,166 --> 03:08:32,733
这很疯狂

4970
03:08:33,550 --> 03:08:36,500
所以他的问题变得越来越好 因为他填补了空白

4971
03:08:36,933 --> 03:08:37,783
这是智力吗

4972
03:08:41,966 --> 03:08:43,133
不 不 不是

4973
03:08:48,300 --> 03:08:55,866
智力追求和精神追求之间有所不同 而对自己无知的补救是一种精神追求

4974
03:08:56,316 --> 03:08:57,783
它基于谦卑

4975
03:08:58,433 --> 03:08:59,416
我有多愚蠢

4976
03:09:00,150 --> 03:09:01,133
我该如何修正

4977
03:09:02,400 --> 03:09:07,033
我真正教给孩子们的一件事 试图教给他们的 是问愚蠢的问题

4978
03:09:08,916 --> 03:09:14,350
这意味着你必须承认自己的不足 这就是谦卑 然后你必须公开宣布它

4979
03:09:15,116 --> 03:09:17,100
是我有多愚蠢 你能修正我吗

4980
03:09:17,200 --> 03:09:21,033
你知道 有时这可能会令人尴尬 尽管比人们认为的要少得多

4981
03:09:21,950 --> 03:09:28,800
通常 如果你在人群中有一个愚蠢的问题并且你一直在注意 80%的人群有相同的问题

4982
03:09:29,716 --> 03:09:31,033
他们会因为你问了而感到宽慰

4983
03:09:32,416 --> 03:09:33,900
实际上 他们会认为你很勇敢

4984
03:09:34,666 --> 03:09:36,583
这很有趣 因为你会害怕

4985
03:09:37,050 --> 03:09:44,966
当你提出问题时 如果你在大学研讨会中 你会害怕你会暴露你的愚蠢 并且会被 你会说

4986
03:09:45,316 --> 03:09:51,250
实际上情况恰恰相反 所有太胆小以至于不敢提出那个问题的人现在认为你很勇敢

4987
03:09:51,533 --> 03:09:53,300
这完全与你想的相反

4988
03:09:54,500 --> 03:09:55,816
是的 这种情况经常发生

4989
03:09:56,816 --> 03:10:06,650
在我的研究生研讨会中 总是那些提出最无知问题的孩子们 假设他们在注意听 因为你可以问一个愚蠢的问题 你知道的

4990
03:10:07,033 --> 03:10:16,216
愚蠢的问题是 你在玩手机 班级刚刚讨论了某个话题而你没注意 你问 嗯 你知道

4991
03:10:16,550 --> 03:10:20,533
注意 那不是一个真正的问题 那只是 你只是在浪费大家的时间

4992
03:10:20,616 --> 03:10:23,650
但如果你真正无知

4993
03:10:24,800 --> 03:10:30,450
我从未有过一个学生提出一个真正的问题而我却认为是一个愚蠢的问题 从来没有

4994
03:10:30,750 --> 03:10:32,400
我也从不那样对待学生

4995
03:10:32,800 --> 03:10:33,950
就像 不 不 如果你

4996
03:10:35,350 --> 03:10:42,283
如果你 这也很酷 因为有时候最愚蠢的问题直击要害

4997
03:10:42,816 --> 03:10:45,666
你知道 是那些会问一个非常基本问题的孩子

4998
03:10:48,666 --> 03:10:51,950
也迫使我真正理解我所教授的内容

4999
03:10:55,150 --> 03:10:57,100
这是他们谦卑的反映

5000
03:10:57,600 --> 03:11:02,433
这是在追求理想中的谦卑

5001
03:11:02,500 --> 03:11:04,133
这不是一个智力练习

5002
03:11:05,400 --> 03:11:06,666
至少不是严格意义上的

5003
03:11:07,850 --> 03:11:09,966
这确实是知识的生成途径

5004
03:11:10,466 --> 03:11:13,100
这似乎也是通往获得智慧的良好起点

5005
03:11:13,566 --> 03:11:14,766
那是通过谦卑获得的智慧 是的

5006
03:11:15,600 --> 03:11:18,316
是的 通过谦卑获得的智慧 对

5007
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:19,950
你接下来有什么计划

5008
03:11:20,150 --> 03:11:21,800
在接下来的几个月里 人们可以期待你带来什么

5009
03:11:22,700 --> 03:11:28,350
嗯 我现在正在做的事情是 我希望能在十二月底之前完成这本书

5010
03:11:28,450 --> 03:11:34,333
这本书将在十一月出版 但我打算奇怪地开始关于这本书的巡回演讲 可能从一月开始

5011
03:11:34,366 --> 03:11:40,483
我打算在美国巡回 然后我想我会去非洲、南美以及东南亚

5012
03:11:40,950 --> 03:11:41,683
这就是计划

5013
03:11:42,900 --> 03:11:46,150
我对这本新书感到非常兴奋

5014
03:11:46,933 --> 03:11:49,016
我希望这将是我写过的最好的一本书

5015
03:11:51,250 --> 03:11:57,466
这将是一本比过去两本更难的书 但不像我的第一本书《意义的地图》那样难

5016
03:11:57,466 --> 03:11:58,300
你是说阅读起来

5017
03:11:58,316 --> 03:11:59,650
是的 它更沉重 更深刻

5018
03:12:04,333 --> 03:12:06,466
你是否一直在努力使它易于理解

5019
03:12:06,566 --> 03:12:07,916
不 其实不是

5020
03:12:08,900 --> 03:12:15,350
我只是尽可能清楚地阐述论点 我认为这样就可以了

5021
03:12:15,500 --> 03:12:25,233
而且我必须再过一遍 再编辑一次 确保它不会比绝对必要的更晦涩难懂

5022
03:12:25,300 --> 03:12:28,216
不 我想把它表述得清晰易懂

5023
03:12:28,250 --> 03:12:33,533
我在已经着手的圣经项目上取得了很多成功

5024
03:12:34,100 --> 03:12:43,800
我在2017年做了一系列关于创世记的讲座 效果相当显著 然后我刚刚完成了与一群思想家一起的出埃及记研讨会

5025
03:12:43,816 --> 03:12:59,316
我知道人们渴望深入故事的分析 而且我周围也有能够帮助我深挖故事、理解它们的好人

5026
03:12:59,333 --> 03:13:06,933
因此 我非常期待 实际上 我写这本书的时候感觉非常好 虽然写作非常困难 但却极其激动人心和有趣

5027
03:13:07,033 --> 03:13:13,483
你之前问我 我认为这本书成功的标准是什么

5028
03:13:16,016 --> 03:13:19,850
我认为你不可能在读了这本书并理解它之后 还能继续是无神论者

5029
03:13:21,816 --> 03:13:25,050
我认为我可以永久性地驳倒无神论的论点

5030
03:13:26,966 --> 03:13:32,783
这在某种程度上很奇怪 因为这并不意味着人们会突然在神的脚下献身礼拜

5031
03:13:32,816 --> 03:13:41,916
这就像需要重新考虑我们所说的信仰意味着什么 我已经解释了其中的一些部分 就像你是否相信善良

5032
03:13:41,983 --> 03:13:47,666
好吧 相信善良和相信神之间的区别是什么

5033
03:13:48,050 --> 03:13:54,583
现在是一个非常细微的区别 虽然有重要的区别

5034
03:13:55,250 --> 03:14:01,100
但它仍然是一个细微的区别 问题是 如果你不相信善良 你就会失去方向

5035
03:14:01,250 --> 03:14:02,483
如果你失去方向 你就会失去希望

5036
03:14:02,833 --> 03:14:08,550
如果你失去方向和希望 你就会感到焦虑和分裂 人们无法在信仰上团结

5037
03:14:08,650 --> 03:14:10,416
换句话说 替代品不好

5038
03:14:11,333 --> 03:14:13,500
逆转启蒙运动不是一件小事

5039
03:14:15,033 --> 03:14:18,016
好吧 希望我们也能保留启蒙运动中最好的部分

5040
03:14:18,566 --> 03:14:23,433
这就像是切斯特顿的栅栏中的切斯特顿栅栏

5041
03:14:24,500 --> 03:14:27,150
就像 比喻说 田野中有多少不同的栅栏

5042
03:14:27,500 --> 03:14:30,716
如果我们把这个栅栏扔掉了 现在又试图把它插回去 但哪一部分正在重新插入地面

5043
03:14:30,716 --> 03:14:35,466
一件非常有趣的事情是 我认为像道金斯这样的人开始意识到这一点

5044
03:14:35,500 --> 03:14:48,600
我知道像道格拉斯·穆雷和艾恩·希尔希·阿里以及尼尔·弗格森这样的人已经认识到 随着上帝的死亡 许多其他东西也随之消亡 有些你意想不到的东西

5045
03:14:48,633 --> 03:14:53,516
其中一个随着上帝消亡而消亡的东西是科学 这是没人预料到的

5046
03:14:53,850 --> 03:14:54,050
为什么这么说

5047
03:14:56,033 --> 03:14:58,816
因为科学作为一种实践 是一种宗教实践

5048
03:14:59,650 --> 03:15:01,366
它基于宗教公理

5049
03:15:01,633 --> 03:15:01,816
是吗

5050
03:15:02,800 --> 03:15:04,850
嗯 你必须相信真理这样的东西是存在的

5051
03:15:06,516 --> 03:15:08,550
你必须相信真理是可以被理解的

5052
03:15:09,716 --> 03:15:12,600
你必须相信理解真理是好的

5053
03:15:13,833 --> 03:15:15,916
你必须相信善这样的东西是存在的

5054
03:15:16,900 --> 03:15:23,266
对 所以想象一下 要成为一名科学家 你必须首先想象 世界对人类智慧是可理解的

5055
03:15:23,850 --> 03:15:30,866
但更重要的是 如果你探索物质世界的奥秘 那将是有益的

5056
03:15:31,133 --> 03:15:32,366
这些不是科学声明

5057
03:15:32,700 --> 03:15:33,866
这些是形而上学声明

5058
03:15:35,200 --> 03:15:37,866
而且那个形而上学声明嵌套在一个故事中

5059
03:15:39,666 --> 03:15:48,600
你知道 启蒙时代的人将科学革命描绘为与宗教底层结构相反的东西 这是不准确的

5060
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:51,183
那是法国大革命

5061
03:15:51,666 --> 03:15:54,033
那是路西法式的智慧历史

5062
03:15:54,533 --> 03:15:55,183
那不是真的

5063
03:15:55,700 --> 03:15:57,350
大学是从修道院中发展出来的

5064
03:15:58,466 --> 03:15:59,750
那是大学的起源

5065
03:16:00,200 --> 03:16:05,283
科学作为一项广泛的企业是在大学中开始的

5066
03:16:06,166 --> 03:16:07,200
它们是从修道院中发展出来的

5067
03:16:07,533 --> 03:16:08,833
这是毋庸置疑的

5068
03:16:09,866 --> 03:16:14,550
就像如果你去哈佛 或者去牛津和剑桥 这是非常明显的

5069
03:16:15,266 --> 03:16:18,716
学院的布局是一种修道院式的布局

5070
03:16:19,600 --> 03:16:27,166
所以 宗教信仰与科学企业之间存在某种根本矛盾的想法

5071
03:16:30,116 --> 03:16:31,883
这完全不是真的

5072
03:16:32,800 --> 03:16:41,533
我们现在正在失去科学企业的部分原因是因为我们已经让它与其形而上学的基础脱节 而它无法存活

5073
03:16:42,166 --> 03:16:44,800
如果你要成为科学家 你必须将真理置于一切之上

5074
03:16:45,366 --> 03:16:46,550
真正的科学家是非常罕见的

5075
03:16:47,450 --> 03:16:49,383
你必须相信真理才能成为科学家

5076
03:16:49,666 --> 03:16:51,816
我认为道金斯相信真理 顺便说一句

5077
03:16:52,533 --> 03:16:58,766
所以他是一个无神论者 但实际上 他比他认为的要少得多

5078
03:16:59,516 --> 03:17:00,500
那是我的印象

5079
03:17:02,033 --> 03:17:05,083
撒谎的科学家是无神论者或者只是恶意的

5080
03:17:05,650 --> 03:17:13,216
道金斯是一个真实的科学家 就他追求真理 就他相信追求真理会让你自由这一点来说

5081
03:17:14,216 --> 03:17:17,783
那么他正走在一条核心是基督教的道路上

5082
03:17:18,600 --> 03:17:29,000
我知道他不喜欢这个想法 但他也不喜欢科学企业似乎在它的可靠性和有效性上崩溃的事实 所以

5083
03:17:32,300 --> 03:17:32,966
我很感激你 伙计

5084
03:17:33,250 --> 03:17:35,466
我很感激我们能共度的时光

5085
03:17:35,733 --> 03:17:40,100
似乎今天早上又有一个非常有趣的转折点

5086
03:17:40,133 --> 03:17:42,250
是的 这次的转折点是你要巡演了

5087
03:17:42,500 --> 03:17:42,733
是的

5088
03:17:43,316 --> 03:17:44,050
你对我有什么建议

5089
03:17:44,066 --> 03:17:45,116
如何在巡演生活中生存

5090
03:17:46,833 --> 03:17:52,683
确保当你站在舞台上时 你明白能有这个特权是多么不可思议

5091
03:17:53,650 --> 03:17:58,300
确保你记住 所有来看你的人 他们都希望从你这里得到一些东西

5092
03:17:58,916 --> 03:18:01,100
他们投入了时间和精力来看你

5093
03:18:01,633 --> 03:18:02,850
你所做的很重要

5094
03:18:03,550 --> 03:18:06,350
你带着感激之心走上那个舞台

5095
03:18:06,866 --> 03:18:07,716
这会帮助很多

5096
03:18:08,100 --> 03:18:08,966
你必须记住这一点

5097
03:18:09,966 --> 03:18:11,283
这也会让你保持脚踏实地

5098
03:18:11,566 --> 03:18:14,516
你应该感激他们没有向你扔石头

5099
03:18:15,750 --> 03:18:18,366
对 你能做这件事多荒谬啊

5100
03:18:18,450 --> 03:18:19,233
这有多不可能

5101
03:18:19,250 --> 03:18:19,366
疯狂

5102
03:18:20,100 --> 03:18:20,733
对 确切地说

5103
03:18:20,916 --> 03:18:23,916
所以你要把这放在心里最重要的位置

5104
03:18:23,966 --> 03:18:32,583
你要记住 你应该为这个奇迹非常非常感激 因为你有机会做这件事实在是太不可能了

5105
03:18:34,766 --> 03:18:39,200
是的 是的 试图做到这一点而不被压垮正在变得越来越困难

5106
03:18:39,333 --> 03:18:44,116
是的 处理这个的一部分方式是将其他人可以做的工作分解出去

5107
03:18:44,833 --> 03:18:52,366
当你在巡演时 社交元素可能会压倒一切 所以你必须在某种程度上保护自己

5108
03:18:52,800 --> 03:18:56,483
但你还要做的另一件事就是 任何别人能做的事就让别人来做

5109
03:18:57,316 --> 03:19:02,566
并且找到一个能干和可靠的人 这样你只需要专注于

5110
03:19:03,733 --> 03:19:07,466
准时到达下一个演出并保持正确的心态

5111
03:19:07,800 --> 03:19:08,750
那是你的工作

5112
03:19:10,250 --> 03:19:11,500
其他人有他们的工作

5113
03:19:11,600 --> 03:19:14,066
确保你周围是做好他们工作的人

5114
03:19:14,400 --> 03:19:19,033
就像我们迄今为止的巡演 它们变得越来越有条不紊

5115
03:19:20,016 --> 03:19:25,166
我不担心旅行、酒店、餐饮、交通等等

5116
03:19:25,616 --> 03:19:28,900
我担心的是提前一小时到达场地

5117
03:19:30,366 --> 03:19:42,066
让自己进入正确的状态 这与我描述的感激态度有关 然后试图与所有参与的观众一起解决一个严肃的问题

5118
03:19:42,616 --> 03:19:49,583
然后 如果这太多了 那么就更多地分配责任

5119
03:19:49,816 --> 03:19:50,983
演出结束后你如何放松

5120
03:19:52,016 --> 03:19:53,683
我会看《拖车公园男孩》

5121
03:19:56,516 --> 03:19:57,283
当然你会

5122
03:19:57,333 --> 03:19:57,800
是的 是的

5123
03:19:58,200 --> 03:20:01,333
毕竟 在那么出色之后 你需要一段时间不那么出色

5124
03:20:01,400 --> 03:20:03,683
《拖车公园男孩》是非常好的放松方式

5125
03:20:03,850 --> 03:20:04,966
稍微抵消一下

5126
03:20:05,033 --> 03:20:07,866
是的 我昨天给罗根发了条短信

5127
03:20:08,350 --> 03:20:11,616
我以为他会有一些智慧给我 天知道那家伙做了多少场演出

5128
03:20:11,933 --> 03:20:13,383
我以为他会有一些建议给我

5129
03:20:13,450 --> 03:20:14,983
我说 每次演出结束后

5130
03:20:15,816 --> 03:20:24,983
我都感到非常兴奋以至于我发现很难平静下来 我连续有四场演出 然后我们飞往迪拜 之后我们在美国和加拿大有所有这些演出

5131
03:20:25,533 --> 03:20:31,400
我担心我无法入睡 如果我睡不好 我明天的表现就不会那么好 然后事情就会恶化

5132
03:20:32,366 --> 03:20:35,250
我以为他会有一些智慧 他说 这真是个难题 伙计

5133
03:20:35,366 --> 03:20:36,983
说实话 我从来没有睡眠问题

5134
03:20:37,016 --> 03:20:38,900
我就像 好吧 我猜这没什么大不了的 你知道

5135
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:41,750
但不 我很兴奋 我很期待

5136
03:20:41,816 --> 03:20:44,650
一切结束后我会再联系你

5137
03:20:44,650 --> 03:20:48,716
我们打算正式录制其中一场 完全正式录制 就像一个特别节目

5138
03:20:49,733 --> 03:20:51,416
所以那将是 也许我们会发布它

5139
03:20:51,500 --> 03:20:53,833
也许它只是为了历史保存 我不知道

5140
03:20:54,016 --> 03:20:55,250
但我们会拥有它

5141
03:20:55,316 --> 03:20:56,666
所以是的 我很兴奋

5142
03:20:56,716 --> 03:20:57,383
嗯 祝你好运

5143
03:20:58,000 --> 03:20:58,416
谢谢你 伙计

5144
03:20:59,200 --> 03:20:59,583
祝你好运

5145
03:20:59,633 --> 03:20:59,866
谢谢

5146
03:21:00,466 --> 03:21:01,300
应该会很精彩

5147
03:21:01,316 --> 03:21:01,416
是的

5148
03:21:02,216 --> 03:21:02,350
是的

5149
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:04,733
我学到了很多 正如我们今天说的

5150
03:21:05,716 --> 03:21:07,500
克服不适并尝试不同的事情

5151
03:21:08,316 --> 03:21:14,850
以及遵循某种接近直觉的东西 我说的很多事情在某种程度上都是脆弱的 我猜

5152
03:21:14,916 --> 03:21:16,266
你知道 它们对我来说是有意义的

5153
03:21:17,166 --> 03:21:21,066
是的 我希望人们能从中获得很多东西 我希望他们今天也做到了

5154
03:21:21,450 --> 03:21:28,100
所以我上台时做的一件事就是 我会在最初的10到15秒内观察观众

5155
03:21:28,750 --> 03:21:29,883
我是说我不把他们当做一群人看

5156
03:21:30,050 --> 03:21:31,100
我看到你经常这么做

5157
03:21:31,683 --> 03:21:33,583
我会称之为审视

5158
03:21:35,366 --> 03:21:37,150
但这并不完全是审视

5159
03:21:37,800 --> 03:21:39,316
这很好 我到处看

5160
03:21:40,366 --> 03:21:42,100
这是一种曝露技巧

5161
03:21:42,150 --> 03:21:43,850
你根本不想害怕观众

5162
03:21:44,700 --> 03:21:46,833
你不想只是对着观众说话

5163
03:21:47,333 --> 03:21:50,466
所以我看着人们 我到处看

5164
03:21:51,483 --> 03:21:56,666
如果是个大地方 你看不到后排 但根本上我尽可能到处看

5165
03:21:56,750 --> 03:22:01,050
我看着个别人 我把他们当作个体 然后我记住

5166
03:22:01,550 --> 03:22:08,433
我在对所有这些来这里的个别人说话 然后这就变得简单了 因为你可以和个人交谈 他们是你的客人 对吧

5167
03:22:08,700 --> 03:22:11,166
这也是你的员工需要知道的另一件事

5168
03:22:11,916 --> 03:22:17,366
就像每个来到你活动的人都要以最积极的方式对待

5169
03:22:17,400 --> 03:22:22,700
因为他们在寻求你的某些东西 你知道 如果他们被无礼对待 对他们来说非常困难

5170
03:22:22,766 --> 03:22:24,700
所以 我们尝试做的一件事

5171
03:22:25,500 --> 03:22:27,166
我现在随行的人相当多

5172
03:22:28,233 --> 03:22:32,716
但每个人都知道 规则之一就是对待观众

5173
03:22:33,116 --> 03:22:41,650
即使是那些有一些麻烦甚至可能造成麻烦的人 就像对待他们是客人一样 因为他们是客人 你非常幸运他们在这里

5174
03:22:41,950 --> 03:22:43,750
所以不要自高自大

5175
03:22:44,366 --> 03:22:47,300
因为他们投入了时间和努力来这里 他们在寻找某些东西

5176
03:22:47,366 --> 03:22:49,450
所以这是感激的一部分

5177
03:22:51,100 --> 03:22:52,916
然后这很有趣

5178
03:22:52,950 --> 03:22:53,750
这让它保持有趣

5179
03:22:54,266 --> 03:22:57,350
就像你很幸运能在那里对他们讲话

5180
03:22:57,750 --> 03:22:58,650
你必须记住这一点

5181
03:22:59,016 --> 03:23:01,850
这是多大的特权啊 这些人

5182
03:23:01,900 --> 03:23:03,683
他们来听你做的事

5183
03:23:04,016 --> 03:23:05,216
这是个很好的交易 伙计

5184
03:23:05,633 --> 03:23:06,733
这是最好不过了

5185
03:23:07,366 --> 03:23:11,466
所以你要牢牢记住这一点 不仅是在心底 也在心前

5186
03:23:13,650 --> 03:23:14,200
我会尽力而为

5187
03:23:14,400 --> 03:23:15,233
女士们先生们 乔丹·彼得森

5188
03:23:15,233 --> 03:23:17,200
乔丹 非常感谢你今天的分享

5189
03:23:17,266 --> 03:23:18,816
我期待着下次我们能再聊

5190
03:23:19,166 --> 03:23:20,016
很高兴与你交谈 克里斯

5191
03:23:20,566 --> 03:23:22,200
非常感谢大家收听

5192
03:23:22,333 --> 03:23:28,166
如果你喜欢这期与乔丹的对话 你会喜欢我与道格拉斯·默里的对话 它就在这里可用

5193
03:23:29,500 --> 03:23:29,700
继续

5194
03:23:30,950 --> 03:23:31,216
点一下吧
