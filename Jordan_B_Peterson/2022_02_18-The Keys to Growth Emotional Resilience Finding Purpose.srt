1
00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:04,333
Predators are one thing but predatory people other tribes man.

2
00:00:04,366 --> 00:00:05,300
They're brutal.

3
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:06,033
They're brutal.

4
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:07,366
What about your predatory friend?

5
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:11,700
Oh, that's pretty bad to the friend who stabs you in the back the person who betrays you

6
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,666
Well, how about when you betray yourself?

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:23,166
Yeah, what's the ultimate predator what's the ultimate predator what's the enemy you harbor in your own heart who hates you

8
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:24,933
That's the ultimate predator

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,100
Dr. Jordan Peterson, welcome to the show.

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,233
Hi Chris.

11
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:31,733
Good to see you

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:32,966
How's the tour going?

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:34,900
It's going great.

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:43,266
The crowds are well-dressed, extremely positive.

15
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:45,033
They're for good reasons.

16
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:50,400
Apolitical in the best sense of the word.

17
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:52,000
Welcoming.

18
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,133
The theatres are packed.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,333
The lectures are going well to extremely well.

20
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:07,233
the time i spend afterwards meeting people is it's like being in a wedding celebration

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,666
i would say that's the closest thing i could what do you mean well you know you go to a wedding and

22
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,833
you meet all sorts of people you don't know generally and everyone's happy to be there and

23
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:21,266
they're all looking good because they dressed up for the occasion and it's a positive event and

24
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:28,166
and that's the closest analogy that i that that i can think of that would

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,266
describe what's happening so and people that are there are there because they're

26
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:40,966
trying to put their lives together and they are putting them together and it's working

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,000
and so everything about it is as positive as it can be fundamentally so

28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,633
yeah it's going great I saw you took a trip to the Tesla factory what were your

29
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:56,033
thoughts after meeting Elon Musk did you get to speak to him much

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,200
I wouldn't say much we we spoke probably for 20 minutes in total not purely privately because there's other people

31
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,766
around but you know i just that just barely gets you to know the surface of someone like musk

32
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:13,833
because he's an amazing person and god only knows what's what's up with him all things considered

33
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:20,266
we saw his new truck he was taking people out for a ride i i didn't i didn't go out for a ride

34
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,866
The trucks an amazing piece of engineering.

35
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:25,133
The factory is massive

36
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,666
You know, what do you say about someone who built a functional electric car then shot it into space on a rocket?

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,366
He's a singular person, but I thought I thought it went very well.

38
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:37,800
It was a very interesting evening

39
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:43,600
so I was pleased to be there and you know, we sort of walked around each other a bit and

40
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,033
It was just fine.

41
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:48,366
Do you guys interact a fair bit on Twitter?

42
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,066
We seem to yeah.

43
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:49,266
Yeah

44
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:50,800
What do you think that is?

45
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,533
Why are you converging?

46
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:55,100
I don't know.

47
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,066
I don't know exactly

48
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,200
We're both well-known and I suppose to some degree that

49
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,933
That increases the probability of that kind of convergence

50
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,233
but

51
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,133
Maybe he's aiming up me, too

52
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:11,266
Seems to me.

53
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,700
He's aiming up literally.

54
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,800
He's aiming up very literally.

55
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,900
Yeah, didn't he put a

56
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:20,633
Wasn't there a spaceman a model of a spaceman in the driver's seat of the car that he put out into space

57
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:22,133
That's certainly possible.

58
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,800
He's got a theatrical twist

59
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:29,933
There's no doubt about that and a great sense of humor because that's really funny to shoot your own car out into space on a rocket

60
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:30,700
That's needlessly.

61
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,666
That's a pretty good joke.

62
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,066
What is it?

63
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,200
What is it?

64
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:40,933
That's why is it that someone like Elon has got himself to the stage where he can say things that almost every other CEO,

65
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,700
you know, he's the richest man.

66
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,566
I don't think he's got himself to that stage

67
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,733
I think he's always done that and so now he still knows how to do it.

68
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:49,833
I mean, you know people think oh

69
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:54,733
Say what I have to say when I get to the point where I'm protected and secure

70
00:03:54,766 --> 00:04:00,266
It's like first of all being protected and secure does not give you the courage to say what you have to say

71
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,033
That's that's a completely

72
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,233
That theory couldn't be more backwards

73
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:10,866
You think you're gonna get braver and braver as you get more and more protected you think that's how the world works

74
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:18,033
I mean, I've watched university professors think that at some point they're going to say what they think as they develop their career

75
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:24,066
But by the time they're protected and secure they spent so much time not saying what they think that they aren't even who they were

76
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:33,366
and they don't know what they think so no, he says what he says because he's always done that and people who are like him are like that and

77
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,300
so

78
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,700
Steve Jobs, I presume was exactly the same way.

79
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,066
I mean, I know people who knew him

80
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:44,233
He always said what he thought and and he was pretty damn cut and dried about it

81
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:49,733
which is why the Apple products are such miracles of Technological mastery.

82
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:53,833
He had a unbelievably canny design eye and was very

83
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
He cut whole projects

84
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,066
Without a second thought in some sense when they weren't working

85
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:04,700
He did that when he came back to Apple the second time

86
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,233
Refined the entire product line got rid of a ton of different things and say no forcing on this.

87
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:10,566
Yeah, right, right

88
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,633
So that was proof.

89
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:16,033
I mean, maybe it was Luke the first time which it wasn't but coming back and doing it again

90
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,800
The second time showed pretty clearly.

91
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,733
It wasn't same with the same with Elon, right?

92
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:25,266
He's refined down what he does to a couple of very very tight parameters

93
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:31,400
Now he seems to have although his hit the enterprise he's put together is unbelievably

94
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:40,933
High-functioning I mean to produce an automobile sub industry that's actually competitive and to

95
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:47,166
bring down the cost of space exploration by a factor of 10 and to invent reusable

96
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,733
rockets and to have developed this boring technology it's it's a miraculous

97
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,966
it's probably an alien yeah probably probably there's only two probably a

98
00:05:57,133 --> 00:06:02,100
reptilian isn't American car companies I think that haven't gone bust Ford and

99
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:07,500
Tesla and Tesla came very close a number of times mm-hmm yeah it's an amazing

100
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,000
accomplishment so go Elon as far as I'm concerned yeah he's a remarkable person

101
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:23,966
what color skin emoji do you use if I used one it would be black why why not

102
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:32,200
it's so preposterous all of that you know everything that's happened to

103
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:41,133
Rogan all this idiocy around race this insistence that we can be reduced to our race, our ethnicity, our sexual identity.

104
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:47,200
It's so appalling and it's so destructive.

105
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:56,966
And one of the reasons that I had a lot of reasons for making my political stance in relationship to Canada's compelled speech laws,

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,700
I had a lot of reasons for making my views about that known.

107
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:16,100
One of them was the fact that my government had introduced a bill that required me to say things a certain way, which was an unparalleled

108
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:22,833
move in the history of Western democracies and something the Americans had made strictly unconstitutional, I believe in 1942.

109
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,766
So that was part of it.

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:38,066
Part of it was I knew that this top-down mandated belief that confusion around gender identity

111
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:43,500
was a positive occurrence to provide that freedom, let's say.

112
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:58,766
I knew that for every person that saved, that would doom a thousand people, primarily girls, to a kind of psychological contagion as confusion about sex and gender identity ramped up.

113
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:00,833
I knew the literature on psychological contagion.

114
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,233
It's quite nicely detailed.

115
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:02,700
What is that?

116
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,866
What's psychological contagion?

117
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,666
You could think about them as psychological epidemics.

118
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:15,166
So the last one, the last one of any real size was the satanic daycare scares in the 1980s.

119
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:21,633
You're probably not old enough to remember that, but the largest, longest sentences in

120
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:33,266
US criminal justice history were handed out often to women who were accused of late onset female sexual predation of children in daycare centers

121
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:46,100
The FBI invented a whole new category of perpetrator category that didn't exist because there are no late-onset female sexual child child sexual predators, they don't exist

122
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:56,000
but there were women who Obtained prison sentences of several hundred years for hypothetically being involved in these satanic daycare

123
00:08:56,733 --> 00:09:04,800
abuse rituals and there was a just swept across the whole country like the Salem witch trials except at a much larger scale

124
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:11,000
There's a book called Satan's silence that was written by a lawyer and social worker that documents it.

125
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:12,066
It's just unbelievable.

126
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:24,133
There were stories about underground tunnels where children were being taken down and being well every possible thing you could think of was happening to them all in the name of like satanic ritual

127
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:33,600
It was a contagion and those things happen it happened with cutting Behaviors happened with eating disorders.

128
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,666
This is almost all among girls because their teenage girls are most prone to this

129
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,633
They called it hysteria back in Freud's time

130
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:52,233
But there's a book by a man named Henry Ellen Berger called discovery of the unconscious that traces back Psychogenic epidemics to about 300 years and I knew that

131
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:59,033
You know people in adolescence, especially people of a certain personality configuration

132
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,733
Have some trouble settling into a stable identity and

133
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:10,633
For a variety of reasons it can be high negative emotion, which is associated with low self-esteem

134
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,033
Those are more or less the same thing and then in all likelihood high trait openness

135
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,800
Which is the creativity dimension and the high trait openness people

136
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:25,466
They're the ones that are more likely to have green hair and red hair and lots of piercings and lots of tattoos and dress in a somewhat

137
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:31,466
in a non standard manner, let's say that's all associated with creative behavior and

138
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:38,500
They have trouble catalyzing a single identity and then if you throw in categorical confusion

139
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:51,266
Which is exactly what you're doing when you declare that there's you know, an endless number of gender identities then people who are prone to identity dissociation and to psychogenic Contagion

140
00:10:53,900 --> 00:11:03,100
There you're gonna demolish them there isn't Abigail Schreier has documented that quite nicely and in her book Irreversible damage and

141
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:08,500
It's way more girls than boys and it's thousands and thousands and thousands of them

142
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:18,900
so you think well perhaps a few people who are Transgender benefited from this new reality, but for everyone who's benefited and you know

143
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:24,966
I'd like to see the data just showing how much they actually benefited and that will take a long time to accrue

144
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:28,166
There is a thousand people who've been just demolished by this

145
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:31,966
so and then what else on the

146
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,466
Well that that's basically that on the political front I could see all that coming

147
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:41,300
I talked the Canadian Senate about it when they put in the legislation.

148
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,033
They didn't listen.

149
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:44,266
They just thought racism bigotry sexism

150
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:46,300
It's like yeah have it your way

151
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:53,400
But, you know, so what all these girls that have rapid onset gender dysphoria and disfiguring themselves

152
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:59,966
and taking hormones and, you know, wreaking havoc with themselves and their families and the broader culture.

153
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,500
These people that were so woke and so permissive, you think they're going to have that on their conscience?

154
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,000
They're on to something, some other noble venture.

155
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:11,366
So

156
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,666
Give me your thoughts on the modern dating market

157
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:20,066
Well, I'm too old to really have any thoughts on it in some sense not from a personal perspective

158
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,100
Well, I don't understand it at a level of detail, you know

159
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:31,000
I I do know some things that are happening perhaps at at universities where

160
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:35,733
There are far more girls than boys or women than men

161
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,500
What happens in those institutions

162
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:41,933
This is what it looks like.

163
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:42,900
Anyways, possibly

164
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:54,166
So females are hypergamous, which means they'll meet across and up heart hierarchies socio-economic hierarchy, but competence hierarchy is really at the bottom of it and

165
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:03,066
So when you set up a situation where there's far more women than there are men in a given domain Say where mate selection can take place

166
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:08,933
Most of the men still don't do very well because most of them are still rejected by women

167
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:15,100
But a small minority of men do extraordinarily well if you think well means unlimited sexual access.

168
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:23,333
And so what's happening in the universities is that a small minority of men have sexual carte blanche in some sense.

169
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:32,666
And most men are in the same position that most young men are always in, which is they're in a state where they're not particularly desirable to women.

170
00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:38,733
And then the women of course are terribly frustrated because the minority of men that they would really like to have long-term relationships with

171
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:43,500
It's a seller's market for those men.

172
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:44,233
They're not settling down.

173
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:45,966
That's the sex ratio hypothesis.

174
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:48,000
And the reverse happens, right?

175
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,633
That you see whoever the most scarce sex is gets to determine the rules of the game.

176
00:13:53,400 --> 00:14:00,133
So the men, if they are in high demand because there's short supply, you get more short-term mating,

177
00:14:00,266 --> 00:14:07,666
you get an increase in relationship dissatisfaction from women, and when the reverse

178
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:14,266
happens you get more dates before sex, you get more long-term mating, you also get more

179
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:20,066
sexual violence in that situation as well when there is a surplus of men and a scarcity of women.

180
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,133
You also get far more unstable societies.

181
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:28,133
I was pilloried a few years back from my comments about enforced monogamy because they were

182
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:33,133
taken out of context and twisted in exactly the way that things like that get twisted now.

183
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:34,866
What did you mean by that?

184
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:47,133
I mean that one human universal is the construction of societies to both mandate and reward monogamy.

185
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,266
And there's all sorts of reasons for that.

186
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,233
It's because it's the best long-term solution, fundamentally.

187
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:57,800
But one of the reasons for that is that when women are scarce, men get violent.

188
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:03,366
Now, you know, that was read to say, well, I thought that this society should be distributing

189
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:08,633
women to undeserving men which is of course absolutely utterly preposterous and bears

190
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:14,466
no relationship whatsoever to anything I ever said or thought or anything anyone sane would

191
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:20,433
ever think or say or has ever thought or said because I don't know anyone politically ever

192
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:25,266
who was insane enough to think that the state should distribute women to men like that's

193
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:31,366
just never happened so to be accused of that belief and then for that to you know be put

194
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:38,066
forward as a credible representation of what I thought was just one of the preposterous things that has happened to me.

195
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:42,633
It's an unfortunate name, enforced monogamy, because it's a term from anthropology, right?

196
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:52,766
But what you mean is culturally celebrated monogamy, culturally and norms that are supporting people and raising that up as an institution.

197
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:55,733
Supporting and punishing both, but mostly supporting.

198
00:15:56,166 --> 00:16:07,600
The punishing is that there's a moral disapproval applied to, say, cheating, to adultery, especially

199
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:11,766
running around behind your partner's back if you're married, particularly that.

200
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:18,200
But even if you're in a long-term stable relationship, it's like, well, that's all enforcement.

201
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:22,866
It's not police with jackboots, but that's not the only type of enforcement.

202
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,433
It's not the only type of sanction or threat or punishment or disappropriation or disgust

203
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:32,333
or contempt or shame or frustration or disappointment, all of those things.

204
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:41,900
And all of that, because monogamy is a good long-term solution, but in some sense a troublesome

205
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:52,733
short-term solution, if you have other options, then all of those elements of social support, let's say, need to be put into place.

206
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:03,566
And that is, as far as I've been able to determine by looking at the anthropological literature, norms surrounding monogamy are human universal.

207
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:09,900
There are exceptions, but there are very specific situational reasons for those exceptions.

208
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,300
You see the ONS data that came out a couple of weeks ago that said for the first time

209
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:18,566
ever since records began, 50.1% of women are childless by 30.

210
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:24,466
There are more women without children at 30 than there are women with children the first time.

211
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:31,300
Well, so this is somebody clipped a Part of one of my podcasts.

212
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:38,166
I believe it was where I was talking about what our society does to 19 year old women or 18 year old women 19 year old women?

213
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:47,233
we just lied to them all the time, you know, the first lie is there's nothing more important than your career more or less by definition

214
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,833
So that's the first lie.

215
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:53,566
The second lie is there will be nothing more important to you in your life than your career

216
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,533
So that's the second lie.

217
00:17:55,533 --> 00:18:02,266
And then the third lie is there should be nothing more important in your life than your career so that's the third lie and then

218
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:15,400
Implicit in that is the idea that children are a burden and that the idea that women should have children is part of the oppressive patriarchy and should be resisted and

219
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:21,800
And who are men to tell me what I can do with my body and hey fair enough and etc, etc

220
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:29,133
now I've worked in female-dominated Occupations my entire life.

221
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:34,166
I work for example, I worked as a daycare worker

222
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:43,600
Way back when that was like 1980 something like that and there were no men doing that but I really liked kids and so that was fun

223
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:48,966
and I worked for social services in Alberta in a in the child care department and

224
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:51,800
Then I've been working as a psychologist

225
00:18:53,033 --> 00:19:00,600
Either training or as a psychologist since then and that's been a female-dominated enterprise increasingly as the years went by but even when I was first

226
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,533
When I first entered it

227
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:03,866
so I

228
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:11,966
I'm in the post female in the workplace generation firmly I Never experienced the world

229
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:22,400
And so I've watched women progress through their professional careers at every level of attainment from the lowest to the highest and observed what happened.

230
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,266
And relatively, I would say bias free because I didn't know.

231
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:40,466
And what I've seen is that as women progress towards their late thirties, no late twenties, they, there's a psychological transformation.

232
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,900
psychological transformation and what happens is that they place less emphasis on their career and

233
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,966
Way more emphasis particularly on having a child and that really reaches a crisis point around

234
00:19:53,700 --> 00:20:00,366
29 or 30 for the vast majority of women and and their attitude flips and I've seen it flip very dramatically with many women

235
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:11,933
and I suppose the most signal single most convincing evidence of that.

236
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:17,600
I worked with high-end lawyers in Toronto for about ten years.

237
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,200
I was part of an organization.

238
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:28,133
We went to law firms, high-end law firms, and said, send us your most productive people and we'll help them iron out

239
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:34,566
whatever wrinkles there might still be in their life and the advantage to them is that things will go better for them and the advantage to you is they'll be

240
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,566
even more productive and there's a good management dictum which is pay the most attention to

241
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:44,733
your most productive people because they're bringing in the bulk of your revenue disproportionately.

242
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:51,600
And so I worked with men and women who were at the peak of their careers in a very difficult enterprise.

243
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,566
And so these were women who were generally very attractive, well put together physically,

244
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:05,400
pretty stable psychologically, extremely conscientious, very, very smart, and high achieving from

245
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:13,833
like junior high all the way through high school, university, law school, onto the top

246
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,266
firms rocketing up through the ranks, full partnership by the time they were 29 or 30.

247
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,066
And all the law firms, all the women bailed out, all of them.

248
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
The law firms couldn't keep them.

249
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:32,566
I was really and I talked to the women a lot about a lot about this because I was very interested in it because I

250
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:40,700
Knew the law firms were bending themselves over backwards and tying themselves into knots trying to retain these women because why wouldn't they you know?

251
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,266
Just just being greedy capitalists is enough, you know

252
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,366
we don't want to lose their high-performing women because they're performing at the highest level and

253
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,366
They couldn't keep them the women wanted to have nine to five jobs

254
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:58,233
they wanted to bind the job so they could have a life and that was especially true once they got interested in having a

255
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:04,500
Child or had one and what what they really came to was a very interesting realization so

256
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,533
because they were highly conscientious women they sort of did their duty and and

257
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:13,800
Worked hard and diligently and didn't pop their head up to ask questions.

258
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,633
They're in junior high.

259
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,400
They got the best grades

260
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,366
They were in high school.

261
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,933
They got the best grades and so on all the way through

262
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,466
Right till they reach partnership, but that's sort of an apogee right you hit partnership in a senior law firm

263
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,466
It's like you're at you're at the top of your profession

264
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,300
Well, then what?

265
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:37,833
So then they looked around and they thought hmm here I am with all these like hyper competitive men

266
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:43,533
Perfectly willing to work 80 hours a week non-stop to stay at the top

267
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,600
What the hell are they doing because that's the real question?

268
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:49,100
What is it?

269
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:54,100
What is it that characterizes this small percentage of hyper competitive men?

270
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:54,366
It's not

271
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,733
You can assume that that's how everyone should be

272
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,466
But first of all, that isn't how everyone is or you can flip that and say well

273
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,066
There's only a small minority of human beings that are willing to do this to work flat out eight hours a week

274
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,533
I mean, they're getting they're certainly being paid for it.

275
00:23:09,566 --> 00:23:11,000
Let's make no mistake about that.

276
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,066
But what about the rest of life?

277
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:15,233
Well, that's what the women asks

278
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,066
Why am I doing this and that's a great question?

279
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,800
Well for men there's a different answer than for women

280
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:26,666
It's a really different answer and it isn't like the men are exactly thinking this through

281
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:30,100
It's it's more like this is an integral part of male motivation

282
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:39,400
The more successful you are as a man the more women like you but the problem that you have now is that as women are getting

283
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,966
Better educated with more employment more status more prestige

284
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:49,166
They compete themselves out of their ability to find an attractive mate as women raise up through the dominance hierarchy

285
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,066
And this is competence higher competence hierarchy.

286
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:52,166
Sorry

287
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:54,933
Who's going to tell women?

288
00:23:56,166 --> 00:24:00,900
the Equal access to opportunity that you have recently just acquired

289
00:24:01,933 --> 00:24:05,600
Actually, what that's doing is it's making it more difficult for you to find a mate that you're fundamentally attracted

290
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,766
Yeah, well it it it does a lot of things.

291
00:24:08,766 --> 00:24:15,333
I mean it does provide women with a lot more opportunity on the economic front it does

292
00:24:16,566 --> 00:24:24,200
decrease their dependency on their mate in relationship to economic security and educating educating women

293
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:27,266
Countries that are willing to educate women.

294
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,933
That's the best predictor of their future economic success

295
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,200
So if you look at developing countries and you want to find out what about a developing country is most likely to predict the fact

296
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:37,533
That they will continue to thrive economically.

297
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:41,500
It's their attitude towards the education of women and but a couple more things

298
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:55,700
Women's educational status predicts their children's educational status, but men's educational status doesn't so that's also an important multi-generational effect I Released a video.

299
00:24:55,733 --> 00:24:57,166
I was gonna conclude that other story.

300
00:24:57,166 --> 00:25:03,533
I released a video or someone released a clip of me talking about some of the things we just talked about and

301
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:08,566
And it went out on YouTube shorts and it's got like 5 million views in a month or something like that

302
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:16,533
and the comment section is Unbelievably vitriolic is every single comment is vitriolic and it's all from women

303
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:21,600
It's like who is this old white bastard telling us what we should do with our bodies, you know

304
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:23,366
And I wasn't being judgmental.

305
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,666
I was just saying exactly what I said to you, which is while I've watched women

306
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,866
Over the entire course of my life with I would say an affectionate.

307
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,366
I you know, I love my sister I love my wife. I have a daughter. I love my mother.

308
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,666
I'm pretty happy about women all things considered

309
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:41,466
I don't have an axe to grind in relationship to how they should conduct their lives

310
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,300
I don't even know how they should conduct their lives

311
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:49,500
I've watched what happens and I've also watched what happens to women who hit 29 or 30 and then can't conceive and

312
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:59,733
That is not Fate I would wish on anyone it's awful and 30% of couples fall into that 30% of couples have difficulty conceiving

313
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:08,633
It's a lot and the probability that you'll have difficulty conceiving increases with age and so, you know c'est la vie and

314
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:18,633
but it's very interesting to me to see how vitriolic those comments have been and how how uniform that is because Usually on my youtube channel in particular

315
00:26:20,266 --> 00:26:24,300
95% of the comments are positive and this is completely the opposite of that

316
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,433
so and then so you brought this up at the beginning you said 50% of women now

317
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:37,100
at 30 50.1 a childless by 30 yeah yeah well you know that's that's not good

318
00:26:37,366 --> 00:26:45,800
that's a sign of something profoundly wrong with the entire culture at an extremely deep level I don't think that women need to take it as us trying to

319
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:56,466
tell women what they should or shouldn't do but I think that it would be very fair to say that you need to be an incredibly unique woman to make it to 50 without a family

320
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,266
and look back and think yeah i did this right that's not to say that those women aren't out

321
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:06,266
there they absolutely are i know some of them but i think overall that it's well it's the same with

322
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:20,866
everyone for everyone i mean this is another example of how our culture has just lost its moorings it's like well what's life well you have a job or a career and hopefully

323
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:28,366
you're productive and you contribute something to the community and you provide yourself and your family with the necessities of life that's a quarter

324
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:39,066
of your life or a third of it something like that you have an intimate relationship you have a family that's life and if you don't have one of those

325
00:27:39,233 --> 00:27:42,366
that's one third of your life you don't have now some people maybe they're doing

326
00:27:42,433 --> 00:27:48,466
So well on the other two fronts that they can cope with not having that or maybe they're doing so well on one front

327
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,100
They can cope with not having two of the compensates.

328
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:51,900
Yeah, maybe

329
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,966
It's pretty hard because if you want to have a great career, it's hard to do that if you're alone and without a family

330
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:00,233
Right.

331
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:04,333
I mean the people that I've seen who've been best situated in their life all things considered

332
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:09,800
Even in relationship to their career have a pretty solid monogamous relationship

333
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:16,200
relationship that stabilizes them and then they have a family that also stabilizes them and broadens out their life and

334
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:24,866
you know exceptional people do exceptional things and good for them, but they're By definition given that they're exceptional.

335
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,466
They're a tiny minority

336
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:33,266
This is always the argument between conservatives and liberals right because the liberal types they're more tilted sometimes towards

337
00:28:34,466 --> 00:28:35,233
What would you call it?

338
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:40,400
compassion or appreciation for the exceptional

339
00:28:40,433 --> 00:28:46,600
and fair enough the exceptional is necessary but on average

340
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,266
what everyone does on average is the thing to do

341
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,533
and so you just look you see well what do people do

342
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:59,033
well if they have a job or career they have an intimate relationship and they have a family

343
00:28:59,066 --> 00:28:59,766
and if you don't have

344
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,766
any one of those things well then your treading water harder

345
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,700
It doesn't mean you can't do it and it doesn't even mean possibly that you shouldn't try but as a default

346
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:15,333
Presumption, it's just utterly foolish

347
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:18,133
What else are you gonna do with your life?

348
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:19,566
Well, maybe you're wildly creative

349
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:26,833
Fair enough, you know, that's extraordinarily rare as well subject to the power law problem in any case

350
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,200
Which is even if you're hyper creative the probability that you're gonna be successful at that economically is extremely

351
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:37,700
Extremely tiny to the point where it's almost non-existent.

352
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,433
It's so difficult

353
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:43,700
Now it does happen and some and you can have spectacular success if you become successful

354
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:51,466
But wasn't it that you did you say last night of the 100,000 most recently printed books only a thousand have sold more than a million

355
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,933
Yes, something like that.

356
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:54,233
It's something how allows all the way down.

357
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:56,700
Yeah everywhere everywhere power law

358
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:03,966
That's you know a tiny minority of people do all the work a tiny minority of people get all the benefit tiny minority of athletes score all the

359
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,600
goals a tiny minority of men get all the women etc a tiny minority of stars have all the mass a tiny

360
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:15,866
Minority of rivers have all the water a tiny minority of cities have all the people etc, etc, etc

361
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:22,700
Everywhere always, you know and and we're so clueless in our culture that we blame that on capitalism.

362
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:23,000
It's like

363
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,433
How does that account for the mass of stars people?

364
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:32,166
so or the you know the volume of rivers or the population density of cities or

365
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,900
rolling the clock forward you and elon tweeted recently about population collapse

366
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:41,566
what do you think is going to happen there oh well i've thought for at least 10 years that

367
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,700
the biggest problem in 50 years will be that there's just not enough people i remember

368
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:51,266
hearing you say a few years ago that you thought we'd peak at about 9 billion yeah we probably

369
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:57,266
won't hit nine yeah and i knew the stats because think about how crazy it is to think that we

370
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:04,400
We might be living on Earth right now at a time with the most number of humans that are ever going to exist at one time ever.

371
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,133
Yeah, that's highly probable.

372
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:13,033
And you know, in the population, the population collapse in developed countries is precipitous, right?

373
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,833
It's like we fall off a cliff.

374
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:18,333
Because it's the same as everyone knows this from the pandemic, the R-naught number.

375
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,233
If fewer people are reproducing, next generation, you have fewer people to reproduce as fewer people are reproducing.

376
00:31:27,366 --> 00:31:40,533
Well, I worked on a UN committee, oh, it's got to be 10 years ago now, to help draft the UN Secretary General's report on sustainable economic development.

377
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,966
And so I looked at all sorts of things like that.

378
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,800
I was very curious, for example, about, because people have been beating the overpopulation

379
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:53,933
drum since, well, it really kicked in in the 1960s, you know, because there were dire predictions

380
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:56,100
By the year 2000, the Club of Rome came out and said,

381
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:03,433
well, there'll be riots and mass starvation and mass movement of migrants and all the things you hear about climate change

382
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,266
because there's too many people on the planet and that just didn't happen at all.

383
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:10,900
That was just, it wasn't just wrong, it was anti-true.

384
00:32:11,066 --> 00:32:12,366
It was absolutely wrong.

385
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:21,466
What happened instead was that everyone got way richer and the bottom section of the population in terms of economic distribution got lifted out of poverty.

386
00:32:21,866 --> 00:32:24,533
Inequality still exists, But that's that power law phenomenon.

387
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:26,333
We already talked about not that that's trivial

388
00:32:26,566 --> 00:32:34,033
It's just unbelievably difficult to determine what to do with there are solutions, but certainly getting rid of capitalism isn't the solution

389
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:39,733
and so I looked at population trends and first of all found

390
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:50,933
Not that this is an act of genius or anything that soon as you educate women at the the size of family shrinks precipitously like below replacement and

391
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,766
That's partly because women have other options that that's a huge play out.

392
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,000
Oh, yes

393
00:32:56,366 --> 00:33:01,900
I mean all the all the countries in the West are way below replacement Korea's way below replacement, South Korea

394
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,900
Japan way below replacement.

395
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:05,166
Yeah.

396
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:05,500
Yeah.

397
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:08,700
I think the number one number one on the planet might be

398
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,866
Chad the country- in terms of growth- eight children on average

399
00:33:14,266 --> 00:33:17,433
Yeah, I think Nigeria will have more people in it than China by the end of the century

400
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:28,433
So yeah, yeah, yeah and Musk, you know, he's a far-looking man and so he's looking around the apocalyptic corner, let's say.

401
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,100
Uh-oh, we're running out of people.

402
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:34,466
And what that means, of course, is that you run out of young people, right?

403
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:42,800
You don't run out of old people first because everyone who is here now is going to be 30 years older in 30 years and it'll be young people we don't have enough of.

404
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,300
don't have enough of and of course young people are the ones who do the

405
00:33:47,366 --> 00:33:53,533
innovation and are going to do most of the heavy lifting etc and so there's gonna be a terrible shortage of young people.

406
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:59,500
Well you see this with some of the things that I posted that ONS data the 50.1% of women and childless by

407
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,400
30 and both men and women are replying to that tweet saying well good there's too many people on the planet in any case.

408
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:07,700
I know.

409
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:19,066
I'm thinking how this NPC midwittery Is so dangerous because it makes people believe that they actually have Something grounded backing up their claims.

410
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:19,666
Yeah.

411
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:19,900
Yeah.

412
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,966
Well in this idea that the planet has too many people on it.

413
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,233
This is

414
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:30,233
There's no sentiment more implicitly genocidal than that statement

415
00:34:32,766 --> 00:34:34,100
So, what do you mean too many people

416
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:36,066
Exactly.

417
00:34:36,066 --> 00:34:37,100
And what do you mean the planet?

418
00:34:38,066 --> 00:34:41,700
And what do you propose to do about that exactly mass abortion?

419
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,566
Is that your answer or should we do something a little more dramatic?

420
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:48,633
Maybe we'll just shame people out of having children and i've seen people do that.

421
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:49,133
Literally.

422
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:50,933
I saw a professor when I was at an

423
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,666
A ted, I think it was it

424
00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:56,900
It doesn't matter

425
00:34:57,266 --> 00:35:00,733
it was a number of professors talking to a couple hundred students and

426
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:05,166
one of the professors who was an environmentalist activist type and

427
00:35:05,266 --> 00:35:09,166
he got up on stage and shook his finger to the whole young crowd saying that him

428
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:12,700
and his wife had only decided to have one child which was in my opinion one

429
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:21,233
child too many for him and told all the young people there if they had a shred of ethical decency that they would severely limit their reproductive potential

430
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,933
and I stood up and said that I thought that was the most one of the

431
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:29,466
most appalling things I'd ever heard anyone in academia say to young people

432
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:36,200
which is really saying something because they say plenty of appalling things and it was a very uncomfortable moment and he huffed off the stage but

433
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:44,500
You know in a frenzy talking about how you couldn't talk about such things without being pilloried on ethical grounds and yeah, that's for sure you come out as a

434
00:35:45,966 --> 00:35:52,666
what emissary of the academic establishment you tell young people that humanity is so corrupt that they should seriously consider not

435
00:35:53,133 --> 00:36:02,833
propagating because that violates the deepest of ethical norms and you think that's a good thing and that that's you're right and Was just beyond comprehension.

436
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:06,833
It's beyond comprehension, but it's associated with like a deeply rooted

437
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,733
Existential self-hatred and I mean hatred at the level of

438
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:19,233
Humanity is like a virus on the planet that we're a cancerous girl except Stein calls this human racism.

439
00:36:19,266 --> 00:36:19,400
Mm-hmm

440
00:36:20,266 --> 00:36:22,166
Mm-hmm, right, right, right.

441
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:23,066
It's that yeah.

442
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,566
Well, we're a cancer on the planet, you know unchecked growth just like a cancer

443
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:29,300
It's like that's how I say a cancer.

444
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,033
It's okay.

445
00:36:30,066 --> 00:36:37,466
We know where your heart is Located because what's what's the implications for for a doctrine like that?

446
00:36:37,466 --> 00:36:38,233
What do you do with the cancer?

447
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:40,033
Cut it out.

448
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:42,633
Yeah, that's for sure poison it or whatever whatever.

449
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:44,533
There's nothing you don't do to a cancer

450
00:36:45,766 --> 00:36:47,466
So you're gonna use a metaphor like that.

451
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,733
There's too many people on the planet

452
00:36:48,866 --> 00:36:51,033
You can use a metaphor like that, you know

453
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:56,533
And then you're gonna you're gonna also decide that you're virtuous while you're using it because you're on the side of the planet

454
00:36:56,866 --> 00:36:57,966
Whatever the hell that means

455
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:06,966
So yeah, it's it's unbelievable and a huge part of its rooted in this existential shame and and

456
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:13,033
horror at the condition of being human and the fact that life is rife with suffering and a lot of its unjustified and

457
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:21,000
You know, it's a Mephistophelean Position so Mephistopheles was laid out portrayed in Goethe's Faust

458
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:27,333
That's the story of a man who sold his soul to the devil for knowledge.

459
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:38,433
It's a story of intellectual pride and Goethe stands in relationship to German literature in the same manner that Shakespeare stands in relationship to English literature.

460
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:43,800
Goethe's Mephistopheles says straight out twice in the play.

461
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:51,366
Once in the first there's two books and once in the first book and once in the second Gerta hasn't restated twice.

462
00:37:51,366 --> 00:37:54,633
Existence is such a foul thing because of all its suffering,

463
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,333
essentially, that it would be better if it was merely annihilated.

464
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:02,200
And that's the Mephistophelean stance.

465
00:38:02,233 --> 00:38:04,433
This whole show should just come to a halt.

466
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:05,800
Look at how corrupt people are.

467
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:06,933
Evil reigns everywhere.

468
00:38:06,966 --> 00:38:08,533
It's nothing but will to power.

469
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:17,033
We're destroying the planet with our unchecked ambition, all of it rooted in greed and Machiavellianism and jockeying for position.

470
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:19,966
we're so contemptible that we should just roll up and die and

471
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,133
We should shame women into not having children and we should shame men.

472
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:29,766
So they never manifest any planet destroying ambition and it's

473
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,800
It's unbelievably appalling.

474
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,600
It goes all the way down to the bottom

475
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:43,400
The bottom of things that's what's tearing our culture apart this dispute about the nature of existence at the most fundamental level

476
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,366
So, and the universities have come out on the wrong side.

477
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:54,100
Talking about the individual, one of the things that I see holding people back is comfort.

478
00:38:54,700 --> 00:39:00,933
So it's easy to get life to a stage where it's not that bad, but it's not that good either.

479
00:39:01,033 --> 00:39:04,866
At least when you have a full on breakdown, there's only one way to go, right?

480
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:11,566
You're only going to go up from there, but I think it's possible to wallow for years in a just about passable life, right?

481
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
Sedated by comfort.

482
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,700
I see this temptation in myself as well to give up the good for the great

483
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:20,166
What would you say to people who are trying to escape this curse of mediocrity?

484
00:39:23,633 --> 00:39:28,600
Well, if you're satisfied with it in some fundamental sense, I mean, there's there's something to be said

485
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,466
I suppose for walling off a private space for yourself if you can maintain it and

486
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:39,566
Detaching yourself to some degree from the troubles of the world and maintaining your own little private garden

487
00:39:40,366 --> 00:39:43,766
The problem with that is the snakes tend to seep in from the outside, right?

488
00:39:43,766 --> 00:39:48,200
It's it's pretty difficult to wall yourself off in any real sense from the concerns of the world.

489
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,700
So it isn't clear to me that that's a viable solution.

490
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:56,400
It also means that you might justify to yourself lack of civic engagement.

491
00:39:56,533 --> 00:39:57,600
You know, I shouldn't go to church.

492
00:39:57,733 --> 00:40:01,033
I shouldn't take part in the political process because it's all so corrupt.

493
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:08,166
I should hide myself from all the annoying noise that's generated constantly on the media front.

494
00:40:08,233 --> 00:40:13,533
And I have some sympathy for that viewpoint, but I don't believe it's really possible because

495
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:20,333
you can't have you can't have a walled garden independent of independently of

496
00:40:20,366 --> 00:40:24,033
the health of the broader society it's just not possible maybe you can have it

497
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:29,033
for a very short period of time but so but if you're if you're comfortable with

498
00:40:29,433 --> 00:40:34,500
what you have and it's Jen it's genuine comfort then I think hey but generally

499
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,200
it's not I think for the most part it's it's people that have become sedated you

500
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,033
know they've forgotten their dreams but they've forgotten that they've forgotten gotten them.

501
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:43,366
Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb is about this, right?

502
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,400
They've become Comfortably

503
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:45,433
Numb.

504
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:49,500
I think most people... I have this friend and this story really hit me.

505
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:59,966
So during the pandemic running a podcast, I was able to have the thing that I feel I'm good at, my artistic pursuit and outlet.

506
00:40:59,966 --> 00:41:01,366
That was available for me to continue.

507
00:41:01,366 --> 00:41:04,233
It was actually increased because I didn't have other stuff to do.

508
00:41:04,233 --> 00:41:07,900
I have a friend that's a barber and he got a job at a supermarket.

509
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,133
Barbara's shut down for a long period of time, and he got a job at a supermarket stacking shelves overnight.

510
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:14,833
And I asked him, I was like, man, how are you finding the new job?

511
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:16,866
It's a big change.

512
00:41:16,866 --> 00:41:18,766
He's like, do you know what it is?

513
00:41:18,766 --> 00:41:19,733
I actually don't mind the work.

514
00:41:19,766 --> 00:41:22,366
I don't mind the people that I work with.

515
00:41:22,366 --> 00:41:24,566
But man, I miss being good at something.

516
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:25,700
Right, right, right.

517
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:25,933
Well, yeah.

518
00:41:26,033 --> 00:41:29,666
Dude, that hit me so hard.

519
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,300
I missed being good at something.

520
00:41:31,866 --> 00:41:38,033
Yeah, yeah, well people need the opportunity to be good at something it so then you might ask yourself

521
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,533
Well, what's the best antidote to the discomfort of life and you might say well, it's comfort

522
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,433
and I suppose that's what you

523
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,266
Act out when you swaddle a baby

524
00:41:52,533 --> 00:42:04,900
But a better antidote is something like adventure to excellence and that's far better antidote to suffering than the mere absence of suffering.

525
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:10,166
So not to say that the mere absence of suffering, that's not nothing, you know.

526
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,833
Stepping out of that sedation from comforts, difficult though, especially if you've become routinized to it.

527
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:19,333
Yeah well that's the difficulty of maturity.

528
00:42:19,366 --> 00:42:23,800
You know the Freudians said very wisely that the good mother necessarily fails.

529
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,933
What's that mean?

530
00:42:25,933 --> 00:42:31,100
It means she stops providing the comfort that insulates people against the need for adventure.

531
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:35,233
I heard you say recently that a mother's ability to let her child

532
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,566
go out into the world knowing that they're still vulnerable and that it's now down to them and the

533
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:43,266
world to look after them, that's one of the bravest things that they can do.

534
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:45,866
It's the female crucifixion.

535
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:51,233
And that's exemplified best in, well the best portrayal of that I've seen is

536
00:42:51,566 --> 00:42:53,533
Michelangelo's Pieta.

537
00:42:53,533 --> 00:43:00,566
It's a statue of Mary and she has Christ's body as an adult on her lap and

538
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:15,400
he's broken and destroyed and you know she's displaying that and that's the bravery of a mother to allow that to happen but not only that to facilitate it.

539
00:43:15,433 --> 00:43:17,433
So where you go kid?

540
00:43:17,433 --> 00:43:27,333
Where you you go way go well why it's dangerous out there it's like yeah no kidding it's

541
00:43:27,433 --> 00:43:34,366
more dangerous here if you stay with me by a lot so you might lose your body out

542
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:41,400
there in the world but if you stay here you lose your soul how do you see that

543
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:44,266
as an individual let's say that there isn't the mother there that's pushing

544
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:51,800
you along well you know one of the things young Carl Jung was very

545
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:58,200
interested in the edible complex and that's basically that overprotective maternal.

546
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:06,133
And he criticized Freud for presuming that it was really something the mother did.

547
00:44:07,266 --> 00:44:09,233
He says it's more relational than that.

548
00:44:09,266 --> 00:44:13,600
First of all, it would be something the father would allow to happen, assuming there was a father around.

549
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,833
So let's not forget about the paternal contribution to allowing that to occur.

550
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:25,700
Because in some sense, it's the father's role to serve as the antithesis of that maternal over protection

551
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:32,966
So a woman is extremely bonded with her infant say between zero and nine months and the infant is utterly helpless and so

552
00:44:33,733 --> 00:44:39,433
Complete compassion and the provision of comfort is the only job that matters and that's really the case

553
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,633
And then the woman has to switch gears to some degree.

554
00:44:42,633 --> 00:44:48,800
The mother has to switch gears as the child starts to become more More mobile

555
00:44:49,033 --> 00:44:55,200
fundamentally and more independent she has to let go of the infant which is a real grieving process and

556
00:44:56,266 --> 00:44:59,900
She has to start to facilitate this movement towards independence

557
00:44:59,966 --> 00:45:07,366
but that's a hard shift and so partly the role of the father in that is to be an advocate for the child's independence and to

558
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:13,700
Comfort the mother to let her know that that degree of security provision is no longer necessary, but also to

559
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,233
Act as an advocate for the child's outgoing

560
00:45:19,366 --> 00:45:23,933
Outgoing desire and so so it's the edible situation is not only the mother

561
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:37,466
It's also say the weak father, but then it's also the child so you can imagine because you don't believe that these Negotiated agreements were we're relational.

562
00:45:37,466 --> 00:45:40,866
So, you know, you're six you're in grade one

563
00:45:42,633 --> 00:45:43,966
Maybe you're feeling a little ill

564
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:45,433
Maybe you're not

565
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:53,266
maybe you're playing with being a little ill and maybe you're playing with exaggerating how ill you are and your mom comes downstairs and says

566
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,400
You know, you've got a test today at school.

567
00:45:56,433 --> 00:45:58,133
Maybe you haven't quite prepared for it.

568
00:45:58,133 --> 00:46:03,266
Maybe you know, you should have and She says but you know you you seem to have a tummy ache

569
00:46:04,533 --> 00:46:08,200
Maybe you're too sick to go to school and the kid thinks

570
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:15,133
maybe I could just stay home and you know, mom could tuck me in and I wouldn't have to take that test and

571
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,733
I wouldn't have to confront the world and he says yeah

572
00:46:19,033 --> 00:46:26,066
yeah, my stomach really hurts and and away we go and the child has made a choice and

573
00:46:26,933 --> 00:46:32,366
You think well that's and that's a catastrophic choice and you think well children shouldn't be held accountable for choices

574
00:46:32,433 --> 00:46:33,366
They make at that age.

575
00:46:33,366 --> 00:46:39,533
It's like a child soon gonna be an adult that's going to make very similar decisions

576
00:46:41,433 --> 00:46:47,666
The the choice has consequences and to be held accountable for that is to recognize purely that the choice has

577
00:46:47,866 --> 00:46:50,266
Consequences and that it is a choice now, you know

578
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,266
You could say well 95% of the blame is to be put on the mother and maybe that's an overestimate

579
00:46:55,466 --> 00:46:57,000
I think it probably is but

580
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,533
The child could say mom.

581
00:47:00,533 --> 00:47:01,800
You don't have to worry about me.

582
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,200
I'm gonna get up and go do this and

583
00:47:06,233 --> 00:47:06,900
That's choice and

584
00:47:08,633 --> 00:47:13,833
And that's the right choice so these are always chicken and egg problems obviously, but

585
00:47:15,066 --> 00:47:21,966
That that fleshes out the complexity of the situation, you know, if you're if you're being Enticed down a pathological road

586
00:47:23,366 --> 00:47:29,733
You can accept or reject the invitation now some people are better at enticing and some people enforce it more harshly and you know

587
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,333
there's all sorts of individual variability in situations like this, but

588
00:47:33,366 --> 00:47:39,333
But just because you're offered the bait doesn't necessarily mean that you have to take it.

589
00:47:41,533 --> 00:47:45,266
And I'm not a determinist, I do believe that people have free will, whatever that means.

590
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,133
That's a murky subject and it gets complicated the more you look at it, but whatever.

591
00:47:51,566 --> 00:48:01,266
It's still a good shorthand way of describing the fact that we seem to be cursed with responsibility for our own destiny, at least to some degree.

592
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,300
How do you advise people that are dealing with imposter syndrome?

593
00:48:06,566 --> 00:48:07,733
Oh, everyone deals with that.

594
00:48:08,466 --> 00:48:12,100
Every time you make a status shift as you move upwards, of course you have imposter syndrome

595
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:18,400
because when you first make a transition into a new role, you are an imposter because you're a beginner.

596
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:19,666
You don't know what you're doing.

597
00:48:20,466 --> 00:48:22,433
And that doesn't mean you're a liar or a fake.

598
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:25,900
And it doesn't mean you should presume more knowledge than you have.

599
00:48:26,866 --> 00:48:30,233
It's what nature say, every great man is an actor of his own ideal.

600
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:37,266
That's that's that's that feeds into the imposter syndrome in some sense if you want to move to the next stage at

601
00:48:37,766 --> 00:48:44,166
Some point you have to act like you're already there when you're just barely started and that's not a lie

602
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:49,100
You know, it's it's the willingness it can be and it can degenerate into a lie

603
00:48:49,366 --> 00:48:54,366
Especially if you presume more than you know, but if you move, you know

604
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,333
Let's say you move from being an undergraduate to a graduate student

605
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:04,933
Well, every all the other graduate students and the professors know that you're just a beginning graduate student there

606
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:10,233
They're not going to expect as much from you as they would from a more seasoned graduate student

607
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:17,800
So you have some leeway that's genuine but you are you know the low-run occupier of that role and of course

608
00:49:17,866 --> 00:49:24,866
You're gonna feel like you're an imposter if you have any sense because you're just barely there you you just made the transition

609
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,633
But that's okay, you know, that's not a problem.

610
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,300
First of all, you have to understand that everyone with any sense who isn't narcissistic feels that.

611
00:49:34,066 --> 00:49:39,233
And it's actually an indication of your mental health and your competence, as long as that doesn't become crippling.

612
00:49:39,933 --> 00:49:40,966
It shouldn't knock you out.

613
00:49:41,066 --> 00:49:41,866
I'm such a phony.

614
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,633
Well, don't be a phony, that's the first thing.

615
00:49:45,133 --> 00:49:50,733
If you're dealing with competent people, and you admit your ignorance, the competent people

616
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:55,200
Never judge you harshly for that, as long as you've been paying attention.

617
00:49:56,033 --> 00:50:00,066
So, in my classes, for example, people were often afraid to ask questions,

618
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:04,666
and so sometimes I would point to people and ask them if they had a question, especially the quieter types,

619
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,166
and they'd be afraid to ask the question because they're revealing their ignorance,

620
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,366
and they would assume they're the only person in the room that's that ignorant, but they're not,

621
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,233
because if they were paying attention and they had a question,

622
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:19,400
the probability that half the class had that question was really high.

623
00:50:19,966 --> 00:50:21,633
That's different if you're not paying attention.

624
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:24,233
And so you can be ignorant.

625
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,433
You can be an ignorant newbie and you can even ask the questions

626
00:50:28,566 --> 00:50:32,133
that are necessary to ask in that position and sort of reveal your inadequacy.

627
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:36,666
And as long as you're dealing with competent people and you've been paying attention,

628
00:50:36,966 --> 00:50:38,633
they're just gonna answer your questions.

629
00:50:38,766 --> 00:50:40,400
And then you only have to be ignorant once.

630
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,166
That's the thing about asking a stupid question.

631
00:50:45,666 --> 00:50:46,733
You only have to ask it once,

632
00:50:47,066 --> 00:50:48,333
then you're no longer stupid.

633
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:54,733
well-balanced people that intellectual humbleness is endearing right really endearing yes so one of

634
00:50:54,866 --> 00:50:58,533
the things that i i want just because they're always asking questions too they always have

635
00:50:58,666 --> 00:51:04,866
imposter syndrome too if they have any sense like what do you what are you more what you know or

636
00:51:04,966 --> 00:51:09,400
what you don't know well if you're competent you know you're more what you don't know and so you're

637
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:13,733
always asking questions you see someone else asking questions you think oh you're asking questions

638
00:51:14,033 --> 00:51:19,200
you probably are competent so and there's the trajectory that's the trajectory of a person

639
00:51:19,433 --> 00:51:24,433
that will become competent or more competent in the future too right so that what i would hope

640
00:51:24,633 --> 00:51:28,366
with imposter syndrome and this is something that i noticed first off in myself but then in other

641
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:36,600
people as well um i've bro-science my way into something called imposter adaptation so hedonic

642
00:51:36,733 --> 00:51:43,066
adaptation is the phenomenon where your happiness level tends to reset after a change in circumstances

643
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:47,900
So you buy a new car or get a new house or get the job promotion and it feels good for a while

644
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,633
But then it resets

645
00:51:49,066 --> 00:51:53,066
Impostor syndrome being that you never feel fully worthy of any achievements that you get in your life

646
00:51:53,266 --> 00:51:55,366
And you don't feel like you are worthy of being there.

647
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,700
Impostor adaptation is a real

648
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:04,133
Nefarious version of this where no matter how many times you disprove your lack of self-belief

649
00:52:05,066 --> 00:52:07,366
It continues to persist in the real world

650
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:12,966
And this there is a kernel of truth in this because what you said if you're trailblazing if you haven't done this thing

651
00:52:13,066 --> 00:52:17,800
before but you also have to think well how many times have i done something analogous to this

652
00:52:18,033 --> 00:52:21,566
how many times have i done something that's kind of like this but not not quite this well people

653
00:52:21,766 --> 00:52:29,066
who are high in trait neuroticism are more likely to feel that way because so neuroticism is the

654
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:37,133
negative emotion personality trait and it's a index of sensitivity to threat and punishment essentially

655
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:45,633
So imagine that it's very difficult to calibrate how many units of physiological preparedness you should manifest per unit of threat

656
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,366
Mm-hmm, right because how big's the threat and the answer is you don't know

657
00:52:51,466 --> 00:52:54,033
You wake up in the morning and you have an ache in your side

658
00:52:55,666 --> 00:53:02,366
Is that nothing or is that the cancer that's gonna kill you in six months and it's pretty low probability that it's the latter

659
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:09,033
but the probability is not zero so why shouldn't you be panicked out of your mind and the answer is some people are and

660
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,866
Sometimes they're right

661
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:18,466
so the calibration of threat especially when it's associated with novelty is virtue and impossibly difficult

662
00:53:18,766 --> 00:53:24,400
Computational problem we have like ten different mechanisms to try to solve that and one of the mechanisms is well

663
00:53:24,433 --> 00:53:30,500
There's tremendous variability in response and if you're higher in trait neuroticism, you're gonna have the problem you're described all the time

664
00:53:30,766 --> 00:53:35,666
you're gonna be doubtful about your competence and the validity of your position and

665
00:53:37,533 --> 00:53:42,866
the only treatment we really know for that is to expose yourself to things that you're afraid of voluntarily and

666
00:53:43,566 --> 00:53:48,133
To become braver as a consequence of doing that but some people have to live with that more than other people

667
00:53:49,566 --> 00:53:50,900
The thing I realized was that

668
00:53:51,733 --> 00:53:55,300
After a while if you continue to disprove your imposter syndrome in the real world.

669
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,766
Yeah, you have a challenge

670
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:01,666
You're adamant that you probably won't or might not or don't deserve to get past it and then you do

671
00:54:02,733 --> 00:54:08,833
After a while you have to admit to yourself that your imposter syndrome has nothing to do with your capacity and everything to do with

672
00:54:08,866 --> 00:54:11,333
Your addiction about feeling like an imposter.

673
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:15,133
Yeah, and well and that that does change as people age

674
00:54:16,066 --> 00:54:24,766
Generally speaking they become more agreeable more conscientious and lower in negative emotion and some of that is that adaptation you see that you've

675
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:30,866
Survive through various challenges and then you can review that evidence to yourself

676
00:54:30,966 --> 00:54:35,666
But also the people around you bolster you because they have confidence in you

677
00:54:35,866 --> 00:54:39,866
and so their anxiety doesn't trigger your anxiety and they'll remind you to

678
00:54:41,133 --> 00:54:45,766
You know, you got this you've done things in such a wealth of data, you know, you've done it so many times

679
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:49,133
Yeah, and yeah, I think and that and that does help

680
00:54:49,433 --> 00:54:54,600
I mean it does help people get more confident as they get older and they accrue experience because of that

681
00:54:55,033 --> 00:55:00,700
But it's subject to that Underlying trait variability and sensitivity to negative emotion.

682
00:55:00,733 --> 00:55:06,300
I mean there there's been good psychometric analysis of self-esteem scales and

683
00:55:07,266 --> 00:55:12,000
neuroticism scales and they're that pretty much the same thing reversed and

684
00:55:14,533 --> 00:55:15,933
Are you confident in yourself?

685
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,500
Self-esteem you lack confidence

686
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:24,800
And so it is harder for some people because it takes more evidence for them to dampen down their their response to threat

687
00:55:25,366 --> 00:55:31,266
So and and it's partly because we're all adapted to some degree to the failure of induction

688
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,433
Right, just because something happened multiple times in the past does not mean

689
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,600
Necessarily that it will happen the next time and that's a big bro.

690
00:55:39,633 --> 00:55:41,100
It's the farmer and chicken problem

691
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:44,800
Right farmers always feeding the chicken chicken thinks the farmers is best friend

692
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,433
There was a stable pattern in the past, you come to rely on it, but at any time that axiom can be disproved.

693
00:55:49,466 --> 00:56:09,766
And so, the fact that we have variability in trait neuroticism is a consequence of the probability of the failure of induction.

694
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:14,700
It's a very difficult problem to solve, how to regulate negative emotion, you know,

695
00:56:14,733 --> 00:56:25,533
and uh, but I would say that the best way we know is to keep facing challenges voluntarily, pay attention at a rate that works for you,

696
00:56:25,533 --> 00:56:32,533
develop your competence, that actually stabilizes the environment around you, so it's actually, it actually is less predictable and less threatening,

697
00:56:32,566 --> 00:56:36,566
plus you accrue that evidence and you get the social support for doing so.

698
00:56:36,633 --> 00:56:37,933
That's your best pathway forward.

699
00:56:39,366 --> 00:56:42,533
You said that a harmless man is not a good man.

700
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:46,500
A good man is a very dangerous man who has that under voluntary control.

701
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:47,833
How should people become more dangerous?

702
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:58,900
Oh, becoming more articulate is definitely, I would say that's the primary array of weapons.

703
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:06,833
So, I mean, physical prowess is something, and it's not nothing, that physical confidence that comes along with that as well.

704
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:13,900
But the same thing replicated at the level of the ability to communicate and to think.

705
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:19,900
That's a way broader field of battle and opportunity.

706
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:24,633
So this is one thing that isn't taught well, especially to boys.

707
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:31,766
It's more important to teach it to boys, I would say, because they're more skeptical

708
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:38,966
of such the educational enterprise in general, generally speaking, partly because they're less obedient, partly because they're less agreeable.

709
00:57:39,866 --> 00:57:41,833
That's particularly true for disagreeable boys.

710
00:57:42,833 --> 00:57:48,833
And agreeable boys get higher grades independent of their IQ and their academic achievement because they're easier to deal with.

711
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,500
So what do you tell disagreeable boys?

712
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,200
There's nothing that makes you more formidable than verbal competence and being able to articulate,

713
00:58:00,366 --> 00:58:03,133
be able to think, to marshal your arguments, right?

714
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:14,266
Some battlefield metaphor, get everything in order, get all your information straight to marshal your forces.

715
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:20,066
And so, I mean that's part of the reason that rap artists are so popular, especially among

716
00:58:20,133 --> 00:58:25,966
Disaffected young men black and white alike because they're unbelievably articulate like they have this

717
00:58:26,533 --> 00:58:38,133
Incredible verbal prowess it's unbelievably attractive, you know, and it's associated with genuine artistic and redemptive activity often focusing on

718
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,933
Something that's approximately the voice of the underclass.

719
00:58:42,933 --> 00:58:43,266
Let's say

720
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,566
But a powerful voice right and it's interesting to see how many young white guys identify with that

721
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,800
Was it Aldous Huxley that wrote Doors of Perception?

722
00:58:53,433 --> 00:58:53,633
Yeah.

723
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,933
So this is kind of an equivalent of that, right?

724
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,933
That you have an experience which many people struggle to articulate.

725
00:59:02,466 --> 00:59:07,066
You take the best of us, the one that has the most precise, most articulate erudite language,

726
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,966
you drop them in and you say, okay, show us what you've learned.

727
00:59:11,933 --> 00:59:16,433
This is the equivalent, but for just a different community, a different sort of life that maybe

728
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:23,133
You don't have the ability to describe what it feels like to live on a council estate in Manchester or in you know

729
00:59:23,633 --> 00:59:26,366
one of the neighborhoods of Brooklyn or whatever it might be and

730
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,200
Then this person can and it feels like it's your voice.

731
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:30,366
Yeah

732
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:36,133
Well, you still if you're a young man, you still feel alienated from your place as rightful heir of the proper Kingdom

733
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,766
I mean that's an existential truism for everyone for every particularly for every young man

734
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,366
because he is an outsider in many ways he's young and juvenile and not very

735
00:59:46,433 --> 00:59:54,100
highly valued and and then is is in some sense hurt by the inadequacies of the

736
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:58,066
current King the current culture and and is easily turned against it because of

737
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:02,433
that and that's the machinations of the evil uncle that's the King Arthur story

738
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:06,800
that's the story of Horace Horace and Osiris it's an ancient ancient story

739
01:00:07,533 --> 01:00:09,066
it's the story of Sauron and

740
01:00:11,766 --> 01:00:13,200
It's there all the time and

741
01:00:14,233 --> 01:00:16,966
You see in that in rap music in hip-hop

742
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:27,333
the all of that alienation being given an articulated voice in an artistic sense and that's a good example of the power of verbal facility and

743
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:31,566
That's the route to let's say marketing education to young men

744
01:00:31,566 --> 01:00:35,966
It's like you want to you want to take your rightful place in the kingdom?

745
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,600
It's like get your tongue straight man.

746
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:47,400
Get it under control in the highest possible sense we went to a comedy club Tammy and I and in New York comedy cellar.

747
01:00:47,433 --> 01:00:52,900
It's a great comedy club and the last comic was an English guy and he was

748
01:00:54,033 --> 01:00:59,900
Not particularly physically pre-possessing and he he made a lot of jokes about that and it was quite funny

749
01:01:00,633 --> 01:01:07,266
And then he divided the audience into five sections and he asked each section to toss up a topic just to yellow the topic

750
01:01:07,966 --> 01:01:13,633
and they were like random topics like the Kennedy assassination and Electric lighting before 1890.

751
01:01:13,666 --> 01:01:17,300
Those were two of the topics and the other three were just as diverse

752
01:01:18,166 --> 01:01:26,566
And then he put on some beats and he did about an eight-minute rap with every verse rhymed and

753
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:27,766
and

754
01:01:28,366 --> 01:01:33,800
He tied the whole thing together at the end and ended at the end of the music all spontaneously

755
01:01:34,633 --> 01:01:37,533
It was unbelievable and that's logos man.

756
01:01:37,533 --> 01:01:41,733
That's the redemptive power of the logos right there the magic word the sacred word

757
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,266
It's just manifesting itself on stage

758
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:51,666
There's some very impressive something about that that does feel dangerous as well and not in a I need to be concerned and this should

759
01:01:51,733 --> 01:01:56,500
be contaminated and walled off, but in a way that you think that person has so much competence

760
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:01,366
that it's flowing out of them and you almost feel competent by being around them.

761
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:08,666
You certainly feel competent by appreciating it, because it speaks to the part of you that is capable of appreciating such things.

762
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:13,233
You think, wow, that's really something, that's an amazing display, that's an amazing thing to see.

763
01:02:13,933 --> 01:02:14,366
Amazing, right?

764
01:02:15,133 --> 01:02:16,666
A very interesting word, amazing.

765
01:02:18,033 --> 01:02:20,700
You're trapped and you're trapped by the charisma of that.

766
01:02:21,366 --> 01:02:26,600
And that charisma, that's not nothing, that's a signal of something redemptive occurring.

767
01:02:27,266 --> 01:02:34,400
That accounts for virtually all of the attraction of hip-hop and rap, it's the articulated voice

768
01:02:35,166 --> 01:02:42,333
of the struggling but worthy underclass, I suppose that's a good way of putting it.

769
01:02:43,133 --> 01:02:45,933
But those who are alienated from their rightful place.

770
01:02:47,066 --> 01:02:52,533
And so that verbal prowess is one of the ways they struggle up towards the light.

771
01:02:53,700 --> 01:03:00,233
And that's a good example of having that danger under control, because it's a dark genre in many ways, right?

772
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:07,900
There's a real undercurrent, an air of violence that surrounds that and its culture.

773
01:03:08,533 --> 01:03:12,566
Like the punk movement in the UK back in the late 70s, same sort of thing.

774
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:23,933
But that capacity to express that in a poetic manner, in a compelling manner, Johnny Rotten was great at that.

775
01:03:24,566 --> 01:03:25,466
He was so intense.

776
01:03:26,566 --> 01:03:30,133
He worked with PIL afterwards, Public Image Limited.

777
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:30,566
Is that it?

778
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,200
Public Image?

779
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:32,866
I think so.

780
01:03:33,233 --> 01:03:40,300
He has a song called Rise, which I used to show my clients all the time when I was starting assertiveness training with them.

781
01:03:40,433 --> 01:03:47,966
I'd put on Johnny Rotten's rise and the line in there is anger is an energy and he's got these unbelievably intense eyes.

782
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:48,866
Anger is an energy.

783
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:49,600
You bet.

784
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:53,100
And John Lydon, man, he could channel that like almost no one I've ever seen.

785
01:03:53,600 --> 01:04:00,666
He'd get that anger built up inside him and then it was completely under control and he expressed it in his music and he's absolutely captivating.

786
01:04:01,866 --> 01:04:02,600
Unbelievably charismatic.

787
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:08,900
And I really liked his music, that raw anger in the music, but it was in the bloody music, wasn't it?

788
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:17,633
Wasn't some random riot, you know, he transmuted that into something, you know, you can argue about the poetic merits of

789
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:27,033
Punk rock, although I don't think you should I mean I Did it my way Sid vicious his version of it did it my way my god

790
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,766
That's a work of genius that it's so it's so brilliantly satirical

791
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:35,633
What someone's doing is they're refining it they're distilling it down and then they're directing it

792
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,166
So I went to a powerlifting competition a couple of years ago

793
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:47,800
There was this one guy there lifting, he holds a bunch of records in the squat, and he's a normal working class guy from a normal working class town on the outskirts of Newcastle.

794
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:52,133
And watching that man warm up is something else.

795
01:04:52,433 --> 01:04:54,400
He's got a sacred playlist.

796
01:04:54,866 --> 01:04:58,766
He never listens to the songs apart from when he's about to step on to the lifting platform.

797
01:04:59,633 --> 01:05:03,133
He's got these headphones on and he's just walking up and down in the same way that you'd

798
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:08,166
see a bull ready ready to go out ready to go and chase something and he steps

799
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:12,966
out on stage and the hairs stand up on the back of your neck you're watching

800
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:19,233
this guy channel rage fury that's the god of war that's Mars yeah he's in

801
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:23,900
touch with that mmm unbelievable and words man you go to war with words and

802
01:05:25,066 --> 01:05:32,733
you think that's what young men should be taught there we go but a fury um I Want to talk about your recovery

803
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:40,666
Can you explain how it felt in the first few days when you realized that it might be over when the clouds were lifting?

804
01:05:41,366 --> 01:05:44,866
You know what happened very incrementally over a period of months

805
01:05:46,266 --> 01:05:50,300
Well, things were slightly less catastrophic in the morning.

806
01:05:50,333 --> 01:05:59,800
It was taking me Three and a half hours to stand up and then it was only taking like three hours

807
01:06:01,566 --> 01:06:04,566
So that looked like maybe something had improved.

808
01:06:04,566 --> 01:06:05,900
It was very slow.

809
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:07,966
Like the question about when did you get old?

810
01:06:08,566 --> 01:06:09,833
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

811
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:10,566
One day at a time.

812
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,800
Exactly.

813
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:15,466
So, you know, and I still have a lot of pain.

814
01:06:15,466 --> 01:06:17,333
I mostly feel like I have a

815
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:20,566
bad flu all the time, but that's way better than it was.

816
01:06:24,133 --> 01:06:25,733
What's changed on the other side of that?

817
01:06:25,766 --> 01:06:29,933
Do you view the way that you should be in world different?

818
01:06:29,933 --> 01:06:32,800
Do you feel like you have a new purpose after being ill for so long?

819
01:06:39,366 --> 01:06:47,700
Hopefully I'm more grateful for the mere absence of catastrophe, you know, and I'm I guess I'm

820
01:06:49,233 --> 01:06:53,300
possibly more pleased to be out say doing this lecture tour.

821
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:56,033
I mean I was really pleased about it in 2018.

822
01:06:56,066 --> 01:07:03,133
I was already pretty damn happy about, happy isn't the right word, overwhelmed, grateful,

823
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:10,533
people in a state of constant disbelief, thrilled about the fact that people were responding

824
01:07:10,633 --> 01:07:17,866
so positively, amazed about the fact that this had like a religious dimension,

825
01:07:18,033 --> 01:07:23,033
overjoyed to see people come and tell me that they had got their lives together and that they were very happy about that.

826
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,700
I had all that already, maybe I feel that more.

827
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:39,566
Now, I wouldn't say that I've learned so much that all the pain was worth it.

828
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:48,433
But that's, I suppose, in some sense, putting a happy ending on something in a way that's just too trite.

829
01:07:48,633 --> 01:07:57,600
It's like, most of that time I would have far rather been dead for all sorts of reasons.

830
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:01,066
So now I'm perfectly happy that I'm not.

831
01:08:02,866 --> 01:08:10,066
I haven't forgotten what that was like There's a lot of people that are very glad that you're not

832
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,333
Yeah, well, that's that that's great.

833
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:13,633
Really.

834
01:08:13,666 --> 01:08:14,266
That's great.

835
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:17,366
You know, and I'm thrilled that I'm about being able to be

836
01:08:19,933 --> 01:08:22,066
Not terrifying to my family let's say and

837
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:25,700
I'm really happy to be back out in public and to be

838
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,733
To be doing what we're doing

839
01:08:28,166 --> 01:08:33,700
My you know along with my daughter and my wife and with the support of my family.

840
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:34,000
It's great

841
01:08:34,966 --> 01:08:36,266
I love this tour.

842
01:08:36,266 --> 01:08:39,233
It's so nice to meet all these people so positive

843
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:44,433
It's ridiculously positive and in a world where so much is negative and ridiculously negative

844
01:08:46,566 --> 01:08:53,666
That's that's a lovely thing to see and to see these thou I'm gonna see a hundred and fifty thousand people in the United States you know between

845
01:08:54,733 --> 01:08:59,400
When the tour started which was about two weeks ago and the end of I think it's the end of April

846
01:09:00,533 --> 01:09:05,433
before we go to Canada and then to the UK and then to Europe and then to Australia and New Zealand and Southeast Asia and Russia.

847
01:09:05,866 --> 01:09:08,400
All of that's on the table.

848
01:09:09,566 --> 01:09:17,400
And to see 150,000 people who are committed enough to trying to make their lives better to come to the lectures and to listen to them,

849
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:26,400
even though they're essentially philosophical treatises, or at least the best I can manage in an hour.

850
01:09:27,566 --> 01:09:30,366
And to watch people be committed to this and to hear their stories.

851
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:30,966
It's

852
01:09:33,533 --> 01:09:38,800
You can't imagine anything could be more positive than that and so that's wonderful if there's something to come back to

853
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:44,266
After having that it's not much better that you could have arrived back into a world to find no

854
01:09:44,966 --> 01:09:50,600
No, I mean the the the downside of it is that There's such a need for it

855
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:56,233
You know because part of what I think I have to offer perhaps is encouragement because

856
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:00,000
I don't think the planet would be better off with fewer people on it.

857
01:10:00,766 --> 01:10:07,866
And I don't think that the ambitious motivations of young men are nothing but the manifestation of the corrupt will to power etc etc.

858
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:17,266
And the fact that so many people are pining away nihilistically in some sense in no small part

859
01:10:17,433 --> 01:10:21,366
because of such accusations, because they're being taken out by their own conscience.

860
01:10:22,533 --> 01:10:24,066
I think that's absolutely appalling.

861
01:10:24,233 --> 01:10:31,200
And seeing how positive people are in relationship to what I'm doing has that as its shadow,

862
01:10:31,433 --> 01:10:34,933
which is, well, isn't it so awful that that's necessary?

863
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:42,300
But it is necessary by all appearances, at least to the people that seem to be listening to me.

864
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:49,566
so c'est la vie and you know, I do believe and I think my family is firmly behind me in this belief that

865
01:10:50,866 --> 01:10:51,266
You know this

866
01:10:54,966 --> 01:10:58,733
The idea that the planet has too many people on it sort of a group idea, you know

867
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:04,400
There's too many people is like the mass of people

868
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,366
The mass is too big and I don't think of people as a mass

869
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,133
I think of people as individuals

870
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:16,366
And so there are not there's not a mass of people

871
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:22,633
it's the wrong level of analysis as far as I'm concerned the right level of analysis is each person and

872
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:27,533
and I think that that's a core tenant of

873
01:11:30,066 --> 01:11:34,733
The of Western civilization to the degree that the West is actually civilized

874
01:11:35,266 --> 01:11:39,333
let's say the more it's civilized the more the emphasis is on the individual and

875
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:40,300
and

876
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:49,233
The idea that the individual is sovereign is the core axiom of Western civilization democracy itself

877
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:54,966
And I believe that that statement is as true as any statement

878
01:11:55,033 --> 01:11:58,600
We've managed to collectively formulate and so if it's true

879
01:11:58,733 --> 01:12:04,633
then it is the real battle is at the level of the individual or even within the individual and

880
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:06,633
That's fine with me

881
01:12:06,733 --> 01:12:12,266
And so mostly what I'm doing is attempting to make connections with individuals even though I'm talking to

882
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,300
Thousands and thousands of people.

883
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,766
I'm never talking to them as a group

884
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,100
Ever I don't even look at them as a group.

885
01:12:20,133 --> 01:12:26,500
I never look at the crowd When I'm talking to that my audiences, I always look at one person, you know

886
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:29,100
It's not always the same person because that makes them uncomfortable

887
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:33,666
They're happy to be singled out for a second or two, but it's weird if it's a minute.

888
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:39,500
Yeah, so I'm always looking at you know, one person or another but I'm always talking to one person.

889
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:42,533
Learned that in part from Kierkegaard, you know

890
01:12:43,933 --> 01:12:48,066
As Kierkegaard believed firmly that as soon as the truth was embodied by the mob

891
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,233
It was no longer a truth

892
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:53,933
The truth was in and of itself something that was always manifested at the level of the individual

893
01:12:54,633 --> 01:12:59,533
People noticing they know this in their own lives that you have wisdom on your own you go into a group and you compromise that

894
01:12:59,766 --> 01:13:03,733
wisdom for some reason social norms or the way you've dealt with past traumas or the

895
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:08,233
The things that you think are the people want to hear from you, you know, that's diffusion of responsibility

896
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:19,066
Right because when you're when you're buried in the mob you can do and say things that that the mob hides from you in the world

897
01:13:19,433 --> 01:13:24,500
Whereas if you're just operating on your own them the consequences of your actions are manifested pretty quickly.

898
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:30,200
No place to hide so We have to keep you know, every group of people isn't a mob either.

899
01:13:30,233 --> 01:13:41,200
I mean there are groups of people that are decentralized highly functioning aggregates, hierarchies composed of individuals, and that's working at every level of analysis.

900
01:13:41,966 --> 01:13:43,633
That's a properly functioning society.

901
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:45,800
That's not a mob at that point.

902
01:13:46,433 --> 01:13:54,533
There's a dynamic that permeates the entire hierarchy that keeps the individuals,

903
01:13:54,600 --> 01:14:01,166
let's say at the bottom of the hierarchy, completely in touch with that smaller number of people who are at the top.

904
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:11,966
A good, a well-functioning democratic political state has that nature, is that there's constant communication upward and downward, just like the way the brain is organized.

905
01:14:12,033 --> 01:14:19,066
The brain's a hierarchy, but information doesn't just propagate from the bottom up or from the top down, even with your visual system.

906
01:14:19,266 --> 01:14:24,833
So for example, when information first enters your brain from your eyes, at the foveal level,

907
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:33,766
each foveal, that's the center part of your vision that's high resolution, every cell in your fovea is represented by 10,000 cells at the first level of visual processing.

908
01:14:34,633 --> 01:14:37,900
And so there's a tremendous amount of input from your eyes to your brain, bottom up.

909
01:14:38,633 --> 01:14:43,100
But even at the very bottom of visual perception, there's more top-down connections from your brain.

910
01:14:44,066 --> 01:14:50,300
So the visual system is hierarchical, but each level of the hierarchy communicates all the way down the hierarchy.

911
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,866
And a good political system is structured that way.

912
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,633
And so you can have a group of people that's not a mob.

913
01:14:57,133 --> 01:15:03,600
It's a different organization and a democratic polity is not a mob, not if it's functioning properly.

914
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:07,300
You know, it's something that was really brought home to me when I went to England because

915
01:15:07,433 --> 01:15:13,933
I went into the lobby of the House of Parliament, this great dome building that's more or less at the centre of the parliamentary cross.

916
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:22,766
And that's where citizens of Great Britain can come and lobby to speak to their representative.

917
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,166
So that's where the voice of the people meets the voice of the representatives.

918
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,466
That's how it should work is in some sense.

919
01:15:29,466 --> 01:15:37,266
There are emotions and concerns that are stirring in an inarticulate manner at the bottom of the

920
01:15:38,566 --> 01:15:44,366
Hierarchy where where the problems first manifest themselves because they always first manifest themselves at the bottom of a hierarchy

921
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:50,033
those problems aren't necessarily easy to articulate and so people stumble forward with their concerns and

922
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:56,266
The job of their representatives is to take those stumbling concerns and aggregate them

923
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:04,333
And to give them voice and to transmit them up the structures of power to transform the laws into the new body of laws

924
01:16:04,733 --> 01:16:13,133
Which is what we act out to to reconcile the bottom with the top and that has to just happen Continually because it's it's a living it's like a living organism

925
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,866
Well, it is in a sense.

926
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:19,466
It is a living organism because it's a meta organism that consists of living organisms

927
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,533
So, you know for all intents and purposes, it's something that's alive.

928
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:26,266
I really really hit me in the lobby.

929
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:29,766
That's where the word lobbying comes from by the way, so it happened there.

930
01:16:29,766 --> 01:16:29,966
Mm-hmm

931
01:16:30,233 --> 01:16:33,466
Mm-hmm, and and people are cynical about lobbying but

932
01:16:35,233 --> 01:16:37,966
People are cynical about lots of things and it's not that helpful

933
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,666
Is it possible to have too much responsibility to take too much responsibility for yourself?

934
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,866
Like one thing I've been thinking is that

935
01:16:46,866 --> 01:16:53,766
But the victim mindset where you believe that you have no control over the outcomes in your life,

936
01:16:53,866 --> 01:17:02,433
I wonder whether there's an opposite where you believe that you have an infinite amount of control over them and you lose faith in your innate ability to just carry you through.

937
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:13,833
I've been thinking a lot about releasing the tiller, which is a Jed McKenna quote. He's talking about the fact that the best way to ride a boat through a storm is to actually

938
01:17:13,966 --> 01:17:18,600
release the tiller and it allows the boat to maneuver best through the swells.

939
01:17:19,233 --> 01:17:30,166
I think that a lot of the time, going back to the imposter syndrome thing that we were talking about, as you start to accumulate more and more competence,

940
01:17:30,233 --> 01:17:38,100
the higher level of overthinking, the higher level of neuroticism, the more of an attention to detail that got you from 0 to 50 isn't necessarily the thing that's going to get you from 50 to 100.

941
01:17:39,633 --> 01:17:41,900
You had to get across a river and it was bad and difficult.

942
01:17:42,466 --> 01:17:45,466
You don't need to carry that boat across ground to then get you across the next one.

943
01:17:46,233 --> 01:17:55,900
And I wonder whether the opposite of a victim mentality where you take responsibility for the things that occur in life, I wonder whether you can overshoot that.

944
01:17:56,033 --> 01:17:56,666
You can, for sure.

945
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:57,866
Yeah, definitely.

946
01:17:58,633 --> 01:18:03,900
I mean, you know, Dostoevsky said that every man was responsible for everything he did

947
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:16,566
and for everything that everyone else does, which is kind of an insane statement, but also somewhat, it's true in a certain sense, you do have an

948
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,833
indefinite responsibility, and you do have an indefinite capacity to bear that responsibility.

949
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:24,066
But that doesn't mean it can't be crushing.

950
01:18:24,066 --> 01:18:31,766
And then I would say the antidote to that is that you're not in this alone.

951
01:18:31,766 --> 01:18:39,266
As your responsibilities mount, and your opportunities increase, you have to delegate

952
01:18:40,366 --> 01:18:46,800
More and more there's enough for every there's an it's important that you do everything you can but there's enough for everyone to do and

953
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,200
So you might say well

954
01:18:50,133 --> 01:18:56,666
The heroic path is one that leads to universal redemption and that's true and you might say well, that's all on you it's like it is in a sense, but then

955
01:18:57,766 --> 01:19:00,766
The problem that you just described comes all during too much burden.

956
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:05,666
Well, I can crush you it can be unsustainable You can torture yourself for not doing it.

957
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:08,866
Well enough and it is up to you, but it's not up to you alone

958
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:10,966
It's not up to you alone

959
01:19:12,433 --> 01:19:16,766
So you delegate you and you you build you help build people around you?

960
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:20,666
So that they're all working in the same direction.

961
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:21,133
It's an effort

962
01:19:21,433 --> 01:19:27,400
It's an effort multiplier in any case and you make sure that they get credit they and I they get

963
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:31,133
They get credit isn't exact credits good enough.

964
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:32,300
It's it's not exactly right

965
01:19:33,533 --> 01:19:40,466
the rewards are are Are in accordance with their efforts and you can distribute that, you know

966
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,233
Because there's also a narcissism that can come along with with that which is well

967
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:49,500
It's all up to me and even if you're working in a very competent manner it can seem that way

968
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:55,033
But there's plenty of work to go around and there's plenty of credit where credit is due

969
01:19:55,233 --> 01:20:02,100
And so what you do as you attain more responsibility and opportunity is you delegate more of that and you do that continually

970
01:20:02,133 --> 01:20:08,133
I mean one of the roles of a good manager is to make him or herself Irrelevant obsolete.

971
01:20:08,133 --> 01:20:08,633
Yeah, right.

972
01:20:08,666 --> 01:20:12,133
So if you're not a good manager if your company would collapse if you disappeared

973
01:20:13,833 --> 01:20:16,766
That should all be delegated out and it's not because you're abdicating responsibility

974
01:20:17,533 --> 01:20:22,566
Because also what happens is that if you can routinize someone something and parse it off to someone else

975
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:27,100
So here's a little kingdom for you, and it doesn't have to be little and it's something that can grow

976
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,733
But here's a kingdom for you

977
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:33,966
Well, then you can go off and do the next thing you need to do which is extremely important

978
01:20:34,466 --> 01:20:37,833
You know and you might think there's there's a kingdom and then it's broken into little kingdoms

979
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:43,433
And so the farther you are down the hierarchy the smaller the kingdom you get but that's only true if you think the world's

980
01:20:43,533 --> 01:20:51,366
a zero-sum game because you could also think of it as a place of indefinite a place with an indefinite number of the largest

981
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:57,733
Kingdoms possible and I think what why do we think this is exhaustible in some sense what we're doing?

982
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:02,666
doesn't look exhaustible you know that's the limits to growth mentality it's like

983
01:21:03,633 --> 01:21:07,100
economists don't believe in that because they think well no we can just get more

984
01:21:07,233 --> 01:21:11,466
efficient which we certainly are we're way more efficient than we once were and

985
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:16,766
those gains in efficiency when they're not being interfered with are increasing

986
01:21:16,866 --> 01:21:22,700
at more than an arithmetic rate why do you think people have a tendency toward

987
01:21:22,766 --> 01:21:26,766
that zero-sum mentality when I find myself thinking that it's one of the

988
01:21:26,833 --> 01:21:31,533
First things that I check myself on I think that is That is cancer

989
01:21:33,066 --> 01:21:37,033
Yeah, well, I mean there there are elements of life that have a zero-sum element

990
01:21:37,133 --> 01:21:41,333
I mean if you're competing with another man, for example to marry a particular woman, that's a

991
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:47,666
Zero-sum game if you only think of the game as including you two in that woman

992
01:21:48,233 --> 01:21:51,433
So you can set up circumstances that are zero-sum

993
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:55,466
But I'm port them across into situations which aren't yeah

994
01:21:55,700 --> 01:22:02,100
well then but to take take that metaphor of zero-sum game where there has to be winners and losers because there's a finite number of

995
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:08,100
Resources is to assume that the rules of that game are the rules that govern all game the set of all games

996
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:10,466
And that's just not true.

997
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:17,200
There's games are infinitely multipliable I mean you can invent a new game people do that all the time the man who invented Catan

998
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:23,000
Which is a game I really like to play it's a very popular board game that didn't exist until he invented it now

999
01:22:23,433 --> 01:22:26,633
You know thousands and thousands of people play it and he made a fortune from it.

1000
01:22:26,666 --> 01:22:28,066
It's like that game never existed.

1001
01:22:28,066 --> 01:22:36,933
So there doesn't seem to be any limit to the number of games we can invent and it's a complicated problem because

1002
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:44,933
we are on a single planet and and some resources are more zero-sum than others, but

1003
01:22:44,966 --> 01:22:54,433
But we haven't really run into any actual zero-sum limits in terms of our, you know, the probability of us living an abundant life on the planet.

1004
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:58,266
We've stewarded some resources very stupidly.

1005
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:03,700
We've done a very bad job of managing oceanic production, for example.

1006
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:13,966
Although fish farms have alleviated that on the production side to some degree, but it's a tragedy of the commons that we could address and should address, as far as I'm concerned.

1007
01:23:13,966 --> 01:23:14,900
as far as I'm concerned.

1008
01:23:14,966 --> 01:23:19,600
One of the good things the Trudeau government has done, I think, to give the devil his due,

1009
01:23:19,833 --> 01:23:25,866
let's say, is to put a lot of the coast of Canada into marine protected areas.

1010
01:23:26,466 --> 01:23:27,033
And that's smart.

1011
01:23:27,633 --> 01:23:30,466
We have to be smart about our resources, but that doesn't mean there's zero sum.

1012
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,233
And certainly doesn't mean the world is a zero sum game.

1013
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:40,966
And that's a Malthusian idea, you know, that population will grow till it consumes all available resources and precipitously collapse.

1014
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,800
And then why do we think apocalyptically?

1015
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,833
Well, because things do come to sudden ends

1016
01:23:46,733 --> 01:23:53,800
People die people get fatal illnesses like the world you saw carefully constructed can be blown apart at any moment by a random occurrence

1017
01:23:54,633 --> 01:24:01,600
genetic mutation that causes the cancer that kills you like life has a like it life has a fundamentally apocalyptic aspect and

1018
01:24:02,666 --> 01:24:11,400
We do understand that because we're self-conscious and then it's very difficult not to apply that kind of apocalyptic reasoning to things as such

1019
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,100
The world's going to burn up the climates too hot

1020
01:24:15,566 --> 01:24:19,333
What about runaway positive feedback loops because that's what the climate types are afraid of.

1021
01:24:19,366 --> 01:24:20,700
It's like hey they happen

1022
01:24:21,833 --> 01:24:23,833
How do we bind our apocalyptic thinking?

1023
01:24:25,033 --> 01:24:26,666
That's a good question, man

1024
01:24:28,033 --> 01:24:29,233
That's a good question.

1025
01:24:29,233 --> 01:24:30,733
We do that through truth.

1026
01:24:30,766 --> 01:24:31,600
We do that with the truth

1027
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:38,800
That's how we do it through dialogue through investigation through exploration through discipline and all of that.

1028
01:24:38,833 --> 01:24:41,633
The Logos is the antidote to the apocalypse.

1029
01:24:41,633 --> 01:24:45,100
Of course, that's central Christian dogma, isn't it?

1030
01:24:45,133 --> 01:24:49,700
That the Logos is the antidote to the apocalypse.

1031
01:24:49,733 --> 01:24:51,600
I fancy that.

1032
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,000
And so what does that mean?

1033
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,466
Love and truth is the antidote to the apocalypse.

1034
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:58,466
Not the planet has too many people on it.

1035
01:25:01,433 --> 01:25:07,200
You said to me when we went out for dinner a couple of months ago, I asked you what I

1036
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:14,433
I should be doing with my life and you said what you're doing right now, I think is pretty good and then you said

1037
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,166
Truth in the service of love.

1038
01:25:18,166 --> 01:25:19,066
Mm-hmm.

1039
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:20,100
What do you mean by that?

1040
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:20,600
He's brought it up again

1041
01:25:24,366 --> 01:25:26,466
Well, it's a hierarchy of virtue.

1042
01:25:26,466 --> 01:25:31,200
I would say, you know, there's an old idea that God is the sum of all that's good

1043
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:35,266
I don't think some is exactly the right metaphor

1044
01:25:36,233 --> 01:25:37,600
It's more like imagine.

1045
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,666
There are eternal verities truth beauty justice love

1046
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:49,733
Love, courage, fortitude, compassion, think of all those things as virtues.

1047
01:25:51,233 --> 01:25:53,533
So virtue is what all virtues have in common.

1048
01:25:53,966 --> 01:25:55,633
Virtue is what all virtues have in common.

1049
01:25:56,666 --> 01:25:58,466
That's the relationship of God to the good.

1050
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,666
God is the essence of the good.

1051
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:05,266
So let me put that aside for a moment.

1052
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:09,766
You may think, how would that manifest itself in your life?

1053
01:26:09,833 --> 01:26:15,033
Well, that might be pursuit of the good and that's the pursuit of the good that unites all proximal goods

1054
01:26:18,766 --> 01:26:21,833
Well, what is that exactly well, it's something like the

1055
01:26:23,566 --> 01:26:28,300
Belief that it would be for the best that all things flourish to the degree that that's possible

1056
01:26:29,166 --> 01:26:34,833
when it when I was a clinician, I thought of that as the good in me serving the best in my clients and

1057
01:26:36,166 --> 01:26:38,300
I think the desire for that to happen.

1058
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:38,666
That's love

1059
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:54,566
So that's the desire for, you say, well, you take a human, bent, broken, miserable, malevolent, hurt, corrupt, weak, pathetic, contemptible, frustrating, disappointing,

1060
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:58,700
all of those things that we can lay on ourselves because of our inadequacies.

1061
01:26:58,733 --> 01:27:04,900
It's like, it's easy to dismiss that, and part of that dismissal is what drives the

1062
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:09,533
notion that the planet has too many people on it and that we're a cancer on the face of the earth.

1063
01:27:10,933 --> 01:27:15,266
It's like, it's not easy to love that, but what do you want?

1064
01:27:15,666 --> 01:27:27,566
You want the broken people to rise up out of their brokenness rather than despise them for it, and then you orient yourself towards that and try to pull that out of people and yourself and

1065
01:27:30,233 --> 01:27:31,500
You have to have that frame

1066
01:27:32,566 --> 01:27:36,266
First that's what you're aiming for and maybe that would be the opposite of hell

1067
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:40,066
This is one thing I would say that unites Sam Harris and I despite our differences in in

1068
01:27:40,966 --> 01:27:47,166
Belief in some sense at the level of detail Sam is very acutely aware of the reality of malevolence and hell now

1069
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,533
He wouldn't frame that metaphysically or religiously but doesn't really matter

1070
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:59,100
He is doing his best To aim away from that as hard as he possibly can I didn't realize till the last time I talked to him that

1071
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:07,533
Sam identified the religious Tradition the dogmatic religious tradition with the totalitarianism that produces atrocity now

1072
01:28:07,666 --> 01:28:11,333
I think that's a misidentification the same way the Marxists blame

1073
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:18,133
Inequality on capitalism inequality is really a problem, but it's not the fault of capitalism and

1074
01:28:18,633 --> 01:28:24,300
Totalitarian atrocity is really a problem but to identify that reflexively with religion

1075
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:33,700
Or even with religious dogma, that's a mistake Dogma, maybe but even that's tricky because what's the difference between dogma and knowledge?

1076
01:28:34,533 --> 01:28:40,600
you know today's knowledge is tomorrow's dogma and Drawing the line between those two is extremely difficult.

1077
01:28:40,633 --> 01:28:43,766
You can't just abandon everything you think even though it's arbitrary you

1078
01:28:45,833 --> 01:28:56,700
You need it to guide you and it can transform into totalitarian dogma and promote atrocity in the service of its no longer valid maintenance.

1079
01:28:57,566 --> 01:28:59,933
But that's a very complicated problem.

1080
01:29:01,233 --> 01:29:05,966
So if that's love, truth in the service of love.

1081
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:10,733
truth to begin with is

1082
01:29:11,833 --> 01:29:13,166
Well, okay.

1083
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,233
We could take that apart a bit

1084
01:29:17,833 --> 01:29:20,300
What you talked about letting the tiller of the boat go?

1085
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:22,800
Well

1086
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:25,033
Imagine that you treat

1087
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,100
So we're having this conversation.

1088
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:33,933
Let's say I want this conversation to go the best way it can possibly go

1089
01:29:35,133 --> 01:29:35,433
Okay.

1090
01:29:35,433 --> 01:29:39,033
Well, I don't know what that way is, but I have to want that to begin with

1091
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:41,466
So I come to the conversation.

1092
01:29:41,466 --> 01:29:50,766
I think I'm gonna try to have the most engaging conversation that I can have, I am going to say what I believe to be the case, during the conversation.

1093
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:57,700
There are some things I want from you, except that hopefully we can meet at that event, and trying to crappy outcomes

1094
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:05,200
I don't know what we're going to talk about, you know, we talked a little bit about possible broad themes, although I don't think we touched on any of the things we actually discussed.

1095
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:10,633
That doesn't mean we didn't need to do the preparation, you know, and then you think,

1096
01:30:10,666 --> 01:30:21,966
well, whatever we accomplish in the course of a genuine dialogue is for the best and that's to let go of the of the tiller and

1097
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:28,833
truth does that it's like because you can't craft the outcome and so what you're doing by engaging in truthful dialogue is

1098
01:30:29,866 --> 01:30:35,200
Letting the wind blow where it's going to blow and you do that if you've decided at some fundamental level

1099
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:46,700
Even if you don't know you've decided that that the truth will set you free and the truth is what is in the final analysis Redemptive and we tend to think of truth.

1100
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:50,066
We tend to think that truth resides in a set of accurate facts

1101
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:52,133
That's actually the weakness.

1102
01:30:52,166 --> 01:30:57,133
I would say of the materialistic atheist position that axiomatic

1103
01:30:59,133 --> 01:31:02,233
Presumption about the nature of the truth, but the truth is a process

1104
01:31:03,433 --> 01:31:06,566
It's it's it's and it's often a dialogical process

1105
01:31:07,466 --> 01:31:11,233
So the truth is the thing that emerges in the course of the search for the truth.

1106
01:31:11,233 --> 01:31:11,933
It's something like that

1107
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:16,033
And true truth is to be found in the search for the truth.

1108
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,800
That's the process that continually revitalizes things.

1109
01:31:20,733 --> 01:31:24,166
And so, and then if your orientation is towards the good,

1110
01:31:26,333 --> 01:31:28,466
to the degree that your orientation is towards the good

1111
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,733
and your belief that the good can prevail,

1112
01:31:31,933 --> 01:31:35,233
which is an article of faith, right?

1113
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:36,366
The good can prevail.

1114
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:37,966
It's like, what's your evidence for that?

1115
01:31:39,933 --> 01:31:44,200
There's evidence for whatever position you want to hold on that, so it's a decision.

1116
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:50,400
And you let go and the truth takes you away, and you think that it's going to go where it should go.

1117
01:31:51,166 --> 01:31:53,233
And you commit yourself to that idea.

1118
01:31:54,233 --> 01:31:55,266
And then that's your adventure.

1119
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,233
That's one of the things that's so cool about that.

1120
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,066
You need this adventure to buttress you against tragedy.

1121
01:32:02,333 --> 01:32:03,966
There's nothing more adventurous than the truth.

1122
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:07,366
And in fact, it's the only true adventure, obviously.

1123
01:32:08,233 --> 01:32:15,366
You just have to think that through for 20 minutes.

1124
01:32:16,366 --> 01:32:18,333
How could it be a true adventure if it wasn't true?

1125
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:21,833
And then why is an adventure if it's true?

1126
01:32:22,333 --> 01:32:23,633
Because you're not crafting the outcome.

1127
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:26,466
And so what does that mean?

1128
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:29,066
It means you've decided that the truth is what will set you free.

1129
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,733
And that's independent in some sense of the evidence.

1130
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:35,633
One of the things my family has learned, and this has taken a lot of learning, is that

1131
01:32:37,266 --> 01:32:43,466
been at least I would say 50 times in the last five years where we thought we'd be taken out by

1132
01:32:43,733 --> 01:32:48,200
what was happening around us sometimes those were big things there was probably 10 of them like

1133
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:55,533
they were public and famous and then there was like 40 things that weren't so big but were still

1134
01:32:55,666 --> 01:33:04,566
plenty big and it was always the same thing it was hot as hell for weeks but flipped

1135
01:33:06,233 --> 01:33:11,533
Always, always, but that doesn't mean it was pleasant to live through the part when it wasn't flipping.

1136
01:33:12,233 --> 01:33:12,833
It was horrible.

1137
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:24,033
But so far, so far, we've been able to let go of the tiller and let the waves take us where they'll take us and not flip the boat.

1138
01:33:25,933 --> 01:33:30,333
Do you think that there's a usefulness in having a nemesis to motivate you, talking

1139
01:33:30,466 --> 01:33:34,500
about some of the situations that you've been through, not particularly those ones exactly

1140
01:33:34,633 --> 01:33:40,066
But I try to avoid making enemies of people or groups or ideas or whatever.

1141
01:33:40,066 --> 01:33:42,633
Yes, don't make unnecessary enemies, but

1142
01:33:43,733 --> 01:33:49,000
There is an extra level of fire that gets lit underneath you when you're going up against someone and I miss it

1143
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:51,566
Sometimes there's a price that you pay for peace

1144
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:56,433
Yeah, well then you just have to look at yourself harder and find the nemesis

1145
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,300
Because it's there all the time.

1146
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:07,800
I mean, there's always parts of yourself that you can overcome come and so that's William James moral equivalent to war essentially.

1147
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:13,166
Now if you need something to grapple with and you probably do you can find that you just

1148
01:34:13,233 --> 01:34:16,833
look inside you'll find something to grapple with you know inadequacy

1149
01:34:17,033 --> 01:34:22,500
weakness susceptibility to temptation narcissism pride envy revenge

1150
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:28,033
resentment frustration lack of faith all of that that that'll keep you occupied

1151
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:31,866
if you really grapple with it and yeah I mean that's an ancient theological

1152
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,633
Question, you know, what's up with the devil?

1153
01:34:34,666 --> 01:34:35,633
Why why is that?

1154
01:34:35,633 --> 01:34:37,300
Why does the possibility of evil exist?

1155
01:34:37,466 --> 01:34:43,800
Why is there a eternal adversary see that reflected in Cain and Abel right at the beginning of the Genesis stories?

1156
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:54,433
essentially the first two human beings are Good set against an adversary and that's that's what opens history that story you think well, why would God construct such a

1157
01:34:54,566 --> 01:35:00,100
of why would God construct a reality where an adversary exists, and maybe it's because

1158
01:35:00,233 --> 01:35:03,200
all things considered, a world with an adversary is a better world.

1159
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,866
Just like a garden with a snake in it is a better garden.

1160
01:35:06,633 --> 01:35:08,100
These things aren't easy to understand.

1161
01:35:09,633 --> 01:35:12,966
No snake, no necessity to contend with snakes.

1162
01:35:14,066 --> 01:35:15,766
So why be awake at all?

1163
01:35:16,633 --> 01:35:18,400
No adversary, no challenge.

1164
01:35:19,066 --> 01:35:19,833
Why be challenged?

1165
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,966
Because maybe you're better for the challenge.

1166
01:35:24,233 --> 01:35:29,933
Maybe that's the challenge to see if you can be better for the challenge, but that should be internal well fundamentally

1167
01:35:29,966 --> 01:35:30,033
well

1168
01:35:30,333 --> 01:35:36,133
If it isn't you'll find it externally because you'll demonize someone to turn them into Satan so that you can find an adversary and then

1169
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:39,133
That's very unfortunate for you and for them.

1170
01:35:39,133 --> 01:35:40,766
That's just not as big a battle

1171
01:35:40,933 --> 01:35:44,600
It's like you you battle with someone external who's malevolent

1172
01:35:44,733 --> 01:35:49,100
Let's say or you think they are and usually you've got that mostly wrong, but not always

1173
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,066
But if the battle is inside, which is where it's supposed to be

1174
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:55,233
But most fundamentally then

1175
01:35:57,533 --> 01:36:00,800
Well, then it's the ultimate it is the ultimate challenge and that's the infinite game

1176
01:36:02,333 --> 01:36:06,400
The external one battle between good and evil on a playing field of chaos and order

1177
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:11,333
it's the eternal game and you know, you can play that out in the external world, but

1178
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:16,600
part of what the religious enterprise up is about and

1179
01:36:17,233 --> 01:36:24,100
And the Christians have really contributed to this is the notion that that sacred battle is fundamentally spiritual

1180
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:30,900
Which is to say in some sense fundamentally psychological it's to be it's to be fought on the battleground of the soul

1181
01:36:32,233 --> 01:36:34,800
Internally, it's a subjective issue.

1182
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:35,666
How do you defeat evil?

1183
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,133
You defeat the evil in your own heart

1184
01:36:39,833 --> 01:36:41,733
That's that is how you do it

1185
01:36:43,033 --> 01:36:46,000
And so if that's all being acted out for you in the world.

1186
01:36:46,033 --> 01:36:48,200
Well, you you've misplaced Satan

1187
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:49,866
That's a good way of thinking about it.

1188
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:51,600
This is another weakness.

1189
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,433
I think of the atheistic position because

1190
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:55,500
You can it's pretty hard

1191
01:36:55,733 --> 01:36:59,733
It's an easy in some sense to dispense with belief in the highest good

1192
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:02,700
But it's not so easy to dispense with belief in evil

1193
01:37:03,533 --> 01:37:04,966
So that's a big problem.

1194
01:37:04,966 --> 01:37:10,233
So then where do you localize it and you can find evidence of it everywhere certainly in institutions

1195
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:11,366
I mean, that's the whole

1196
01:37:11,933 --> 01:37:19,000
Systemic racism corrupt patriarchy narrative is that Satan is to be found at the core of our institutions and to some degree

1197
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:24,466
That's true because everything we do is corrupt to some degree.

1198
01:37:24,466 --> 01:37:26,533
And so then do you fight it sociologically it?

1199
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:30,100
you're the good person and the institution is

1200
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:31,400
Satan

1201
01:37:32,366 --> 01:37:33,600
So you're so good.

1202
01:37:33,633 --> 01:37:33,833
Are you?

1203
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:38,766
You're so sure that are you you've got everything in order or do you and

1204
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:45,933
And you might say well, do you have to have everything in order before you fight evil on the sociological front?

1205
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:50,000
and the answer is well, no because you're never gonna have everything in order, but

1206
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,166
You still shouldn't put the cart before the horse

1207
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,266
It's really it's a spiritual battle and it's taken people

1208
01:37:58,933 --> 01:38:01,800
Thousands and thousands of years to figure this out now.

1209
01:38:01,833 --> 01:38:02,900
First of all, it was the snake

1210
01:38:04,133 --> 01:38:05,133
What's what's evil?

1211
01:38:05,166 --> 01:38:08,533
What's malevolent the predatory reptile fair enough, man?

1212
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:14,366
I mean, we've been fighting with predatory reptiles for 60 million years as mammals 60 million years

1213
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:16,733
So it's a good first-pass approximation

1214
01:38:18,066 --> 01:38:21,933
It's the snake the poisonous snake the external enemy the predator

1215
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,033
But what about the predator and other people?

1216
01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:27,933
Yeah, that's even worse man.

1217
01:38:27,966 --> 01:38:33,066
It's like how credit predators are one thing but predatory people other tribes man

1218
01:38:33,733 --> 01:38:34,700
They're brutal.

1219
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:35,200
They're brutal

1220
01:38:36,333 --> 01:38:36,433
Oh

1221
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,066
Well, what about your predatory friend?

1222
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:45,633
That's pretty bad to the friend who stabs you in the back the person who betrays you Judas God.

1223
01:38:45,633 --> 01:38:47,166
Maybe that's the ultimate snake

1224
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:49,833
It's like well, how about when you betray yourself?

1225
01:38:51,933 --> 01:38:52,233
Yeah

1226
01:38:53,733 --> 01:38:55,133
Do you want to see there's this?

1227
01:38:55,500 --> 01:39:01,033
Association that's very strange that occurred in the development of Christian thought between the snake in the Garden of Eden and Satan

1228
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:06,633
There's no indication in the original story that the snake has anything to do with the Lord of all evil

1229
01:39:07,833 --> 01:39:08,700
It's a very weird

1230
01:39:09,633 --> 01:39:10,866
Conclusion that's been drawn.

1231
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:16,400
It's almost extra biblical because there's almost no mention of Satan in the Bible at all

1232
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:21,466
Much less any direct connection between the serpent and Satan.

1233
01:39:21,466 --> 01:39:23,233
It's a very very strange idea

1234
01:39:23,833 --> 01:39:26,966
But it's part of this psychologization of evil.

1235
01:39:26,966 --> 01:39:29,000
Like what's the ultimate predator?

1236
01:39:29,033 --> 01:39:30,466
What's the ultimate predator?

1237
01:39:31,333 --> 01:39:34,400
What's the enemy you harbor in your own heart who hates you?

1238
01:39:35,533 --> 01:39:36,566
That's the ultimate predator

1239
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,733
You know and when there's these images of mary

1240
01:39:43,033 --> 01:39:47,500
With her head in the stars and baby in her arms and her foot on a snake it's like well

1241
01:39:48,833 --> 01:39:56,066
That's the eternal feminine heads in the stars because she's oriented towards the highest good and she's protecting her infant from predators

1242
01:39:56,833 --> 01:40:06,933
that could be An actual predator that's been the case throughout not just human history, but mammalian history could be other people who are predators

1243
01:40:08,133 --> 01:40:09,600
Could be men who are predators

1244
01:40:10,433 --> 01:40:11,033
Could be her

1245
01:40:12,633 --> 01:40:13,400
Who's a predator?

1246
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:15,366
the devouring mother

1247
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:21,666
It's like well what what's the ultimate locale of genuine evil

1248
01:40:22,533 --> 01:40:25,266
Highest religious answer is that's in you

1249
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:27,966
That's the proper place to battle it out

1250
01:40:28,933 --> 01:40:32,200
And I think that's true.

1251
01:40:32,233 --> 01:40:32,933
I think that's lit

1252
01:40:33,266 --> 01:40:34,833
It's literally and metaphorically true

1253
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:43,800
and I was convinced of that in part because of Solzhenitsyn's writings because Solzhenitsyn identified the totalitarian state with the willingness of

1254
01:40:45,033 --> 01:40:51,600
The subjects of that state the subjects and the perpetrators at the same time to live by lies

1255
01:40:53,533 --> 01:40:57,266
No, no law no totalitarian state if people don't lie

1256
01:40:58,766 --> 01:41:04,433
Every time you lie in support of the totalitarian state, then you're the perpetrator and that's a psychological issue

1257
01:41:04,566 --> 01:41:06,200
It's like you're gonna lie to get along or not

1258
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,500
Say well, what does it matter?

1259
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:10,333
I'll go along with it.

1260
01:41:10,366 --> 01:41:11,200
It's okay

1261
01:41:12,566 --> 01:41:18,700
We'll see how it matters because it matters and that's all a psychodrama as far as I'm concerned

1262
01:41:20,033 --> 01:41:22,033
Fundamentally when it's properly placed

1263
01:41:23,633 --> 01:41:26,166
You've got plenty of problems to take care of on your own front

1264
01:41:26,233 --> 01:41:29,633
And that's where you should concentrate your efforts.

1265
01:41:31,966 --> 01:41:36,700
One of the things that I've realized is that people that are self-reflective, that

1266
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:43,400
rely on cerebral horsepower, that pay attention, that think in a detailed way, the more nuanced

1267
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:48,733
that you're thinking is, the fewer people are going to be like you, which makes you feel more alone.

1268
01:41:49,566 --> 01:41:50,733
How do you think people can overcome this?

1269
01:41:55,466 --> 01:42:02,766
Well, I would say that hasn't been my experience, exactly, because as I started to make my thoughts

1270
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:07,566
more public, they seem to appeal to more and more people.

1271
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:12,666
And so I don't know if that's a threshold phenomena, because maybe it is, you know.

1272
01:42:13,866 --> 01:42:19,066
As you start to become specialized as a scientist, in some sense, your vision narrows and narrows,

1273
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:24,366
although it gets more high resolution at the level that you're operating, but you kind

1274
01:42:24,433 --> 01:42:31,500
of pass through a needle, let's say, out the other side where the thing you're studying starts to become everything again.

1275
01:42:32,466 --> 01:42:35,933
And so maybe that's that developmental progression.

1276
01:42:36,466 --> 01:42:37,100
Further more.

1277
01:42:37,466 --> 01:42:38,866
Yeah, specialization and then…

1278
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:40,333
Generalization again.

1279
01:42:41,233 --> 01:42:43,900
Yeah, I think that you might be right there, the deeper into the breach thing.

1280
01:42:44,300 --> 01:42:47,833
The show that I went to go and see you do in Manchester in 2017 or 18, someone asked

1281
01:42:49,666 --> 01:42:53,566
a question about the depth of my consciousness causes me to suffer and you said you take

1282
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:57,566
more of the thing that poisons you until you turn it into a tonic that girdles the world

1283
01:42:57,700 --> 01:43:01,466
around you and I think that this is something you see here as well that when you start to

1284
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:05,666
think differently when you start to consider the way that you're living your life in a

1285
01:43:06,466 --> 01:43:13,700
more detailed higher resolution more unique more nuanced way you will probably receive

1286
01:43:13,866 --> 01:43:18,200
pushback especially you know speaking from personal experience in a normal working class

1287
01:43:18,366 --> 01:43:24,433
towns people born live die in these places it's insular there isn't a huge

1288
01:43:26,133 --> 01:43:29,700
culture of especially in the UK tall poppy syndrome is a huge problem the

1289
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,100
biggest difference that I've noticed actually between American people and

1290
01:43:33,266 --> 01:43:36,866
English people is that American children are told that they can be anything that

1291
01:43:37,033 --> 01:43:41,000
they want to be mm-hmm they're told that they have blue sky vision they can

1292
01:43:41,066 --> 01:43:45,066
achieve whatever they want and that gives them a lot of confidence when us

1293
01:43:45,633 --> 01:43:48,966
Brits stuffy stiffer pellet Brits see Americans on TV

1294
01:43:49,233 --> 01:43:53,900
It sounds like everyone's had media training because everybody's just so enthused about whatever it is

1295
01:43:54,100 --> 01:44:00,533
even if it's a 18 car pile up and then the equivalent in the UK is that

1296
01:44:01,833 --> 01:44:06,600
Deviating from the norm is very very very quickly mocked.

1297
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:06,833
Mm-hmm and

1298
01:44:07,966 --> 01:44:10,266
There's a lot of that in Canada to tall poppy syndrome.

1299
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:11,700
It's a big deal now

1300
01:44:11,733 --> 01:44:20,700
Now the Japanese have that saying too, except it's the nail that sticks up above all the rest is the first one to be struck down by the hammer.

1301
01:44:22,066 --> 01:44:28,266
And there's some truth in that too, there's some truth in that, but some and all are very different words.

1302
01:44:29,366 --> 01:44:34,233
When you roll the clock forward, what you end up with is American children that then

1303
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:39,200
become adults who look around at the world and say, well, hang on, this wasn't what I was promised.

1304
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,933
I was told that I could be anything that I wanted to be.

1305
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,900
I was told that I could have anything that I wanted to have.

1306
01:44:44,933 --> 01:44:50,733
There's a difference between you can earn everything that is earnable and you deserve everything there is.

1307
01:44:52,366 --> 01:44:58,033
So that message can become what you say, it can become misinterpreted in a narcissistic manner.

1308
01:44:58,633 --> 01:45:02,500
And I think that has happened to some degree, especially as people have had fewer and fewer children.

1309
01:45:04,733 --> 01:45:09,200
You know, Jonathan Haidt and Luke Enough talk about the coddling of the American mind.

1310
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:15,033
they think about that in large part as a consequence of an ideological transformation and

1311
01:45:16,066 --> 01:45:22,200
Some of that's true, but it's also useful to look at more fundamental phenomena

1312
01:45:23,966 --> 01:45:25,433
People have children when they're a lot older

1313
01:45:26,566 --> 01:45:28,600
They have way fewer children.

1314
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:31,300
They have way more resources when they have children on average

1315
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,133
You know if you're one kid of eight

1316
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:39,266
You're pretty much battling it out for attention for a very finite amount of parental attention with a lot of intense

1317
01:45:39,466 --> 01:45:46,866
competition and the probability that you're going to come out of that entitled and narcissistic is pretty damn low because your siblings will

1318
01:45:47,233 --> 01:45:48,766
Definitely punish you for that

1319
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:54,500
but if you're the only child especially of older parents who are also more conservative because of their age and

1320
01:45:55,033 --> 01:46:00,700
Also less willing to take chances with you because there's only one of you and then you have a lot of resources at your disposal

1321
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:02,500
Well, that's a whole different.

1322
01:46:02,533 --> 01:46:08,233
That's a whole different Developmental milieu and we have no idea what the consequences of that are

1323
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:15,766
But the idea that children in that circumstance are more likely to be over protected and dependent and structured

1324
01:46:15,833 --> 01:46:17,166
It's like well, yeah

1325
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:24,766
Undoubtedly, and you know that that would even be an overabundance of parental virtue in some sense, right?

1326
01:46:25,533 --> 01:46:27,866
Well, we just did nothing but pay attention to our child

1327
01:46:29,266 --> 01:46:32,666
Okay, but too much.

1328
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:34,000
What did you expect?

1329
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,066
It's so strange because I'm an only child, right and all of the what?

1330
01:46:38,066 --> 01:46:44,066
Well maybe my friends might say differently, but a lot of the commonly held presumptions

1331
01:46:44,133 --> 01:46:49,466
around only children, I just, and I have a couple of friends who are as well, and I don't

1332
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:53,800
know whether it's where we're from, that the northeast of the UK is very spit and sawdust,

1333
01:46:54,033 --> 01:47:02,466
it's salt of the earth people, it's, you know, grab your bootstraps and your boots and start pulling, and I just haven't, I haven't seen that.

1334
01:47:03,233 --> 01:47:06,466
What is it through your clinical practice?

1335
01:47:06,966 --> 01:47:12,500
This might not be a primarily working class phenomena, you know, the coddled mind phenomena.

1336
01:47:12,766 --> 01:47:15,366
That could easily be a middle class, an upper phenomena.

1337
01:47:16,066 --> 01:47:23,900
Is there something, was there a common trend or from your reading have you found that only children tend to be one way or another?

1338
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:27,500
So you just get huge variance in them as well?

1339
01:47:28,066 --> 01:47:31,900
I don't know the answer to that at the level of individual psychological data.

1340
01:47:32,066 --> 01:47:33,700
There might be a literature, I'm not aware of it.

1341
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:37,200
For me, that was more a response to Hyde's book on the coddled mind.

1342
01:47:37,266 --> 01:47:40,233
I thought, okay, fair enough, coddling of the American mind.

1343
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:41,433
What's driving this?

1344
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:43,200
It's not just ideas.

1345
01:47:43,333 --> 01:47:44,700
It's a huge demographic switch.

1346
01:47:44,866 --> 01:47:47,033
It's a huge transformation in the way we raise children.

1347
01:47:47,533 --> 01:47:49,200
We're 10 years older when we have our children now.

1348
01:47:49,633 --> 01:47:50,400
That's a lot older.

1349
01:47:50,933 --> 01:47:52,866
You know, when you're 18 and you have a kid, you're still a kid.

1350
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:56,266
And there's some wildness that's perhaps not so good about that.

1351
01:47:56,433 --> 01:48:00,966
But there's also perhaps a higher proclivity to go off and live your own life.

1352
01:48:02,166 --> 01:48:07,066
And then, you know, how much children, how much should your children be left on their own?

1353
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:09,766
The answer is as much as they can tolerate.

1354
01:48:11,366 --> 01:48:12,133
And how much is that?

1355
01:48:12,733 --> 01:48:21,466
Well, you find out with each child, but it's certainly possible to not deprive your child enough.

1356
01:48:23,233 --> 01:48:31,300
So I've realized that it's scary when you find a thing that you're going to fully commit

1357
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:35,433
yourself to the pursuit of, especially if it's excellence that you're going after, because

1358
01:48:35,933 --> 01:48:38,333
There's no more room for your inadequacies to hide

1359
01:48:39,266 --> 01:48:44,633
Anymore, you can't decide to change direction and do something else if things get tough.

1360
01:48:44,633 --> 01:48:45,933
There's no more ejecta seat, right?

1361
01:48:46,333 --> 01:48:47,133
I've committed to this.

1362
01:48:47,133 --> 01:48:47,766
This is my thing.

1363
01:48:47,766 --> 01:48:49,800
This is one of your rules, you know commit to something is

1364
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:53,733
Yeah, commit to at least one thing as hard as you can and see what happens

1365
01:48:53,833 --> 01:49:00,566
Yeah, precisely aim yourself in one direction and I had a rule with my clients because you know, you might say well

1366
01:49:00,733 --> 01:49:02,900
I've gone halfway down this path and I found out it's wrong

1367
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,266
Well, how do you distinguish that from just giving up?

1368
01:49:06,266 --> 01:49:07,966
Well, that's a really hard question, right?

1369
01:49:07,966 --> 01:49:08,800
It's it's a moral hazard

1370
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:13,733
Because it's inappropriate to continue in a direction you now realize to be wrong

1371
01:49:14,433 --> 01:49:18,366
But it's also inappropriate to give up and use that

1372
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:23,333
Rationalization as an excuse and how do you distinguish especially seen as we're not transparent to us?

1373
01:49:23,333 --> 01:49:23,900
Well, right exactly

1374
01:49:24,433 --> 01:49:26,000
So that is genuinely a moral hazard

1375
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:35,300
so one of the principles that I tried to abide by in my therapeutic discussions was you can change course as long as the next thing you do is equally or more difficult

1376
01:49:36,433 --> 01:49:38,866
Because that's a check against just giving up

1377
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:40,433
so

1378
01:49:41,833 --> 01:49:45,733
You want to discipline yourself so you can get yourself organized so that you can go in a particular direction

1379
01:49:46,333 --> 01:49:47,800
So that when you find the right direction

1380
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:51,666
You can really go in that direction and that does require an apprenticeship of sorts

1381
01:49:52,433 --> 01:49:58,200
And it might not matter in some sense exactly what the apprenticeship is as long as it is rigorous

1382
01:50:00,233 --> 01:50:04,466
Right, and so that's sort of a bridge between moral relativism and moral absolutism

1383
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:07,566
There's lots of games you can play

1384
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:11,800
It's not that obvious a priori which is the best game.

1385
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:14,400
So that's kind of a morally relative stance.

1386
01:50:14,433 --> 01:50:17,933
There's multiple playable games

1387
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:21,633
But then the absolute is yeah, but you have to play one of them

1388
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:25,833
You have to learn to play one of them have become an expert at at least one of them

1389
01:50:26,566 --> 01:50:32,066
And then that's not a relative Proposition and I believe that's true.

1390
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:35,200
That seems to me to be the case so you want to commit to something and

1391
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:38,966
Then you you have when you commit to something you

1392
01:50:39,900 --> 01:50:45,366
Require yourself to bring all of your disparate disparate components

1393
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:50,066
Moving in a single direction united in a single direction.

1394
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:55,466
So it's a unifying to unifying act and Then once having been unified

1395
01:50:56,633 --> 01:51:02,366
Well, then you can bring that unity to bear on a variety of different tasks, but you have to bring it together first

1396
01:51:03,666 --> 01:51:08,066
So and that that makes sense developmentally you see children start out

1397
01:51:09,833 --> 01:51:14,000
as a disparate bundle of motivations and emotions sort of warring with one another and

1398
01:51:14,900 --> 01:51:18,166
And then they can integrate that into single games that they can play with themselves

1399
01:51:19,233 --> 01:51:22,066
And then they integrate that with games they start to play with other people

1400
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,866
And all of that is integration.

1401
01:51:24,866 --> 01:51:27,133
It's not subjugation, it's not repression

1402
01:51:27,533 --> 01:51:30,066
Not if it's a good game, it's integration

1403
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:35,166
You want to get integrated because then you have all the horses that are pulling your chariot

1404
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:37,000
Pulling in the same direction

1405
01:51:37,700 --> 01:51:39,866
And you're much more likely to get to where you want to go then

1406
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:42,666
And also much more likely to specify a good place to go

1407
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:51,033
So that's something else conservatives have to teach young people, which is, well, get yourself disciplined.

1408
01:51:52,233 --> 01:51:53,733
Well, why?

1409
01:51:53,766 --> 01:52:00,133
Well, not so you're a slave, but so that you could be a master, to use a terminology that you're not supposed to use anymore.

1410
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:05,033
But, you know, this is in relationship to yourself, not to others.

1411
01:52:06,566 --> 01:52:13,800
So, yeah, and to begin with, you have to accept an external master because you just don't

1412
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:17,400
have the wisdom to do that for yourself or the ability or the opportunity often.

1413
01:52:20,466 --> 01:52:25,366
Everybody knows this, you know, they feel bad when they decide they're going to put,

1414
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:29,833
get themselves in good shape and go to the gym and lasts like three attempts, yeah.

1415
01:52:31,366 --> 01:52:36,400
And then no one's happy about the fact that they quit and they berate themselves for it.

1416
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:41,933
We know that we need to go through a disciplinary process and we need to subjugate ourselves to a disciplinary process

1417
01:52:42,433 --> 01:52:47,066
That's part of the problem with the constant harping about the you know, oppressive patriarchy

1418
01:52:48,466 --> 01:52:49,800
You need a disciplinary process

1419
01:52:51,266 --> 01:52:51,400
so

1420
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:54,766
Well, that's just oppression and slavery.

1421
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,000
It's like no it's not

1422
01:52:57,533 --> 01:52:58,533
No more than a game is

1423
01:52:59,666 --> 01:53:02,333
Not not a good game a good game isn't oppression and slavery

1424
01:53:02,666 --> 01:53:08,533
We saw is it being on time being punctual was laid at the feet of some oppressive supremacy.

1425
01:53:08,566 --> 01:53:09,200
Yeah, obviously

1426
01:53:11,066 --> 01:53:12,400
Yeah, it's utterly

1427
01:53:13,333 --> 01:53:15,933
Imbecilic, I mean even at a scientific level

1428
01:53:15,966 --> 01:53:21,466
There's no that's trait conscientiousness, by the way to be punctual part of orderliness and dutiful ness

1429
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:26,366
Industriousness, there's no evidence whatsoever that that varies by ethnicity or race

1430
01:53:26,466 --> 01:53:33,966
Well supremacy yeah or supremacy and it there is evidence that if you are like that you are more like supreme

1431
01:53:34,033 --> 01:53:35,533
Well, you are more likely to succeed.

1432
01:53:35,566 --> 01:53:37,166
It's one it is the most

1433
01:53:37,933 --> 01:53:39,700
Determinating it's the most

1434
01:53:41,066 --> 01:53:47,566
It's the most potent personality predictor of success in algorithmic domains managerial administrative domains

1435
01:53:48,733 --> 01:53:57,166
so hard work works and in fact the degree to which hard work works is actually the one metric of of the health of a society

1436
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:03,000
Like the higher the correlation between conscientiousness and outcome the healthier the society.

1437
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,833
Well, obviously why well

1438
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:10,266
You want the bulk of the credit to go to the people who are the most productive.

1439
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:10,433
I mean

1440
01:54:11,233 --> 01:54:14,033
Not because not even in some sense because they deserve it

1441
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:17,233
Because what does deserve mean exactly?

1442
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:19,533
it is because they deserve it but

1443
01:54:20,266 --> 01:54:21,966
That's a black box that word.

1444
01:54:21,966 --> 01:54:25,133
It's because if you want them to keep making stuff

1445
01:54:25,433 --> 01:54:31,300
You have to do that and you want them to because well or what you don't want food.

1446
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:32,133
You don't want shelter

1447
01:54:33,766 --> 01:54:36,966
Why would you not reward the people who provide it differentially?

1448
01:54:38,466 --> 01:54:43,400
It's just your own even your own narrow self-interest would require that

1449
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:44,733
so

1450
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:52,733
Talking about committing to one thing and the inevitable pain of they're not being an easy get-out anymore

1451
01:54:52,933 --> 01:54:54,500
I've decided that this is my thing.

1452
01:54:54,533 --> 01:54:55,833
I'm going after it.

1453
01:54:55,833 --> 01:55:00,433
Yeah, it's useful to stick a temporal parameter or an accomplishment parameter on it

1454
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:01,666
That's one of the reasons why

1455
01:55:03,166 --> 01:55:03,833
Six months.

1456
01:55:03,866 --> 01:55:04,666
Yeah.

1457
01:55:04,666 --> 01:55:05,000
Yeah.

1458
01:55:05,033 --> 01:55:07,500
Well, I'm gonna get this degree no matter what

1459
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:09,533
Well, it's a time limit.

1460
01:55:09,533 --> 01:55:13,700
It's not your whole life, but you're committed to that and then you do box yourself in

1461
01:55:13,966 --> 01:55:15,333
It's like well, I'm in this box.

1462
01:55:15,366 --> 01:55:16,366
I have to make the best of it.

1463
01:55:16,366 --> 01:55:16,800
That's right

1464
01:55:17,866 --> 01:55:20,000
You're in this box and you have to make the best of it

1465
01:55:20,266 --> 01:55:22,000
So and you might say well, I don't want to be in a box

1466
01:55:22,366 --> 01:55:26,233
Like are you so sure you don't want to be in a box a box is a fortress

1467
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:29,466
The walls keep the dragons away you want to be in a box

1468
01:55:30,333 --> 01:55:32,100
Paradise is a walled garden

1469
01:55:33,333 --> 01:55:35,500
It's not a garden without walls.

1470
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:37,933
It's got walls right you have a house.

1471
01:55:37,933 --> 01:55:39,933
It has walls you have a room it has walls

1472
01:55:41,966 --> 01:55:46,533
You don't want to be outside of a box pick your damn box and then figure out how to make it into a garden

1473
01:55:47,666 --> 01:55:49,500
Well, I want a box without walls.

1474
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:51,900
It's no you don't it's nothing but snakes

1475
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:57,000
Yeah, you spoke about this last night in relation to relationships.

1476
01:55:57,033 --> 01:55:57,333
Mm-hmm.

1477
01:55:57,333 --> 01:56:00,000
And you said that when you commit to somebody there is the

1478
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:04,333
Inevitable pain that any future

1479
01:56:04,566 --> 01:56:08,933
catastrophe is going to need to be worked out in a difficult way between you and the person that you've committed to as

1480
01:56:09,366 --> 01:56:11,033
Opposed to you being able to go.

1481
01:56:11,066 --> 01:56:11,900
Oh, well cool.

1482
01:56:11,933 --> 01:56:12,533
I'm out of here.

1483
01:56:12,533 --> 01:56:14,800
The side chicks are warm on tinder in any case

1484
01:56:14,966 --> 01:56:15,500
I'm off.

1485
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:16,866
Yeah, right, right, right.

1486
01:56:16,866 --> 01:56:19,300
Well, that was something I really learned from reading Carl Jung.

1487
01:56:19,333 --> 01:56:20,933
He thought about marriage as

1488
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:23,633
He used alchemical symbolism as

1489
01:56:28,266 --> 01:56:28,766
purification

1490
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:30,533
requires heat

1491
01:56:32,433 --> 01:56:33,033
Heat and pressure

1492
01:56:34,566 --> 01:56:36,633
and so you have a container and it gets hot and

1493
01:56:37,866 --> 01:56:44,200
And that's when you want to leave that's when the changes can take place and sometimes they have to be radical to maintain the relationship

1494
01:56:45,866 --> 01:56:48,933
Very radical, but hopefully those radical changes are positive

1495
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:54,433
But what makes you think you'd make them if there wasn't a fire lit under you and one of the fires is I can't escape

1496
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:55,900
From you here.

1497
01:56:55,933 --> 01:56:57,866
We are locked in combat right here.

1498
01:56:57,866 --> 01:57:00,066
We are in this adversarial relationship beneficial.

1499
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:02,233
Yeah, exactly beneficial adversary

1500
01:57:02,366 --> 01:57:07,000
Yeah, there's no out except through and there's no evidence that through will work

1501
01:57:08,566 --> 01:57:08,766
but and

1502
01:57:10,533 --> 01:57:13,433
So that's part of the utility of the vow is to turn the temperature up

1503
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:17,866
And you know you could say well, I'll escape but the problem with that is

1504
01:57:19,433 --> 01:57:20,133
Escape to where?

1505
01:57:21,166 --> 01:57:26,633
You're not gonna have another relationship, and if to the degree that you brought the catastrophe to the previous relationship

1506
01:57:26,766 --> 01:57:29,933
Which is at least a 50-50 probability, right?

1507
01:57:31,166 --> 01:57:32,966
What makes you think you're not going to bring it to the next relationship?

1508
01:57:32,966 --> 01:57:34,966
You're the common denominator between all of the experiences you have.

1509
01:57:35,033 --> 01:57:37,766
Right, I've had many bad relationships.

1510
01:57:37,766 --> 01:57:38,733
Like, really?

1511
01:57:40,466 --> 01:57:41,966
I've never met anyone I can trust.

1512
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:42,900
Okay.

1513
01:57:42,933 --> 01:57:43,066
Ah.

1514
01:57:46,333 --> 01:57:47,866
Everyone's motivated by power.

1515
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:51,833
What's the common denominator here?

1516
01:57:51,833 --> 01:57:52,533
Exactly.

1517
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:56,166
So, you know, it's tricky because I've,

1518
01:57:56,733 --> 01:57:59,500
I mean, lots of people in my family have been divorced,

1519
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:04,166
divorced which is the case in virtually every family and i don't feel like i'm in a position

1520
01:58:04,366 --> 01:58:09,666
to shake my finger at people and say you know you failed and with more effort you could have

1521
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:16,433
succeeded that's not up to me to decide and many of those people have gone on to have

1522
01:58:16,966 --> 01:58:25,466
more successful relationships the second time around but that doesn't belie the initial point

1523
01:58:25,633 --> 01:58:36,000
And besides even the people who went through a divorce wanted to get married again, they still see utility in the vow and the container.

1524
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:40,866
So, you know, you can't make these things into inviolable absolutes.

1525
01:58:40,866 --> 01:58:45,266
Zero divorce, zero drugs, zero climate change.

1526
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:48,700
No, that isn't how the world works.

1527
01:58:48,733 --> 01:58:51,300
Partly because there's always the snake in the garden, right?

1528
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:53,566
There's no zero.

1529
01:58:53,566 --> 01:59:00,666
Not without the application of increasingly totalitarian force has to be some leeway but you don't

1530
01:59:00,733 --> 01:59:05,366
blow the whole systems apart just to provide some leeway it's a very difficult thing to negotiate

1531
01:59:06,766 --> 01:59:13,933
you know i've had clients who had partners that really couldn't be negotiated with the whole idea

1532
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:23,066
of negotiation wasn't negotiable and i didn't see they really had any choice to either maintain the the millstone around their neck and drown or to leave.

1533
01:59:24,466 --> 01:59:29,166
It's an awful choice, but that doesn't mean that marriage is a prison that no one should ever enter.

1534
01:59:30,900 --> 01:59:32,433
It just means that things are complicated.

1535
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:38,966
Optimizing for absolutes always ends up in, Cal Newport says this about email, really interesting insight.

1536
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:43,400
He says that one of the problems that you have with anything is when you drive the cost

1537
01:59:43,633 --> 01:59:50,366
down to literally zero, you end up with a ton of very weird externalities that you didn't think of.

1538
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:53,566
And he made some argument that every email should cost five pence.

1539
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:54,366
Right, right.

1540
01:59:54,366 --> 01:59:56,633
If every email cost five pence, you would receive 90% fewer emails.

1541
01:59:57,400 --> 01:59:58,333
Right, right, right.

1542
01:59:58,333 --> 01:59:58,933
Yeah, yeah.

1543
01:59:58,966 --> 02:00:07,700
The proper, it's very, we've wrestled with that very frequently, building these programs to help people.

1544
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:13,600
So with my colleagues, both of whom are psychologists, one a clinical psychologist, one a research psychologist,

1545
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:17,566
we built personality tests to help people understand their personalities,

1546
02:00:18,233 --> 02:00:24,366
Which also produces a couples report so that you can understand the differences between you and your partner at a temperamental level.

1547
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:28,666
And we produced this suite of writing programs that help people write an

1548
02:00:28,733 --> 02:00:33,766
autobiography and an analysis of their virtues and faults and a plan for the future.

1549
02:00:34,366 --> 02:00:37,400
And, you know, one question is, well, why not give it away?

1550
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:41,833
And the answer is because zero is not the right cost.

1551
02:00:42,900 --> 02:00:43,866
Now what the right cost is.

1552
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,233
That's really tricky.

1553
02:00:45,333 --> 02:00:49,333
Well, that's why you have markets is to determine what the right cost is zero

1554
02:00:50,066 --> 02:00:53,566
It's like we've sold way more of these than we would have ever given away

1555
02:00:54,233 --> 02:00:58,600
partly because people presume that if it costs nothing it's worth nothing and

1556
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:03,633
Partly because it isn't free like we actually worked

1557
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:10,366
well, one of my partners worked pretty much full-time for 15 years on this at

1558
02:01:11,133 --> 02:01:16,500
At subpar wages making a tenth of perhaps of what he could have made in the private domain

1559
02:01:16,966 --> 02:01:20,466
Like if he would have gone out and marketed his skills because he's a brilliant programmer.

1560
02:01:20,466 --> 02:01:24,500
He has a PhD in psychology extraordinarily educated unbelievably

1561
02:01:25,133 --> 02:01:31,433
Accomplished he could have made a fortune in the private in other private endeavors

1562
02:01:31,666 --> 02:01:36,300
He worked at subpar wages for 15 years before we had any success on this front at all

1563
02:01:37,133 --> 02:01:40,200
So it wasn't free by any stretch of the imagination

1564
02:01:41,533 --> 02:01:45,100
it was unbelievably expensive for us to do this and so then to and

1565
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:51,633
Then to say pillory it because somebody might say well if you were really interested in the welfare of the human race

1566
02:01:51,733 --> 02:01:54,600
You wouldn't be making money off your redemptive endeavors.

1567
02:01:54,633 --> 02:01:54,900
It's like

1568
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:57,400
What do you know about it?

1569
02:01:58,566 --> 02:01:59,100
Exactly.

1570
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:01,000
Have you ever tried to build something and market it?

1571
02:02:01,033 --> 02:02:02,766
Do you have any idea what that entails?

1572
02:02:02,833 --> 02:02:10,833
Yeah, like first of all, have you built something that works that's scalable that would help you've demonstrated that it worked

1573
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:11,900
You've done all that

1574
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:18,466
And that's like you're five percent of the way there buddy because you think now you've got a good thing that people will line up to use it

1575
02:02:19,533 --> 02:02:22,166
Ninety-five percent of the problem is marketing and communication.

1576
02:02:22,166 --> 02:02:25,066
Have you ever tried to communicate about a product that you've built?

1577
02:02:25,900 --> 02:02:31,133
No, and you're telling me that somehow I'm malevolent because I'm trying to make enough money off this to

1578
02:02:31,166 --> 02:02:37,233
You justify its existence to make sure that I've designed it in a way that people actually want.

1579
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:40,633
You can tell that because they'll pay for it in a way that will sustain it and allow

1580
02:02:40,766 --> 02:02:44,500
it to grow while simultaneously trying to reward the people that developed it.

1581
02:02:45,266 --> 02:02:46,133
That's all wrong, is it?

1582
02:02:47,033 --> 02:02:47,733
And you know that.

1583
02:02:49,433 --> 02:02:56,433
So no, I have a set of empty-headed axioms about inequality and I'm judging you morally

1584
02:02:56,533 --> 02:03:01,000
because of their, what, injudicious application, because that's easier than thinking.

1585
02:03:02,733 --> 02:03:03,766
That's where that argument goes.

1586
02:03:04,466 --> 02:03:05,066
It's just irrational.

1587
02:03:05,700 --> 02:03:08,233
Price is an indicator of quality, and it's a commitment device.

1588
02:03:08,633 --> 02:03:11,766
It's a rough indicator, but it's better than any other indicator we have.

1589
02:03:12,433 --> 02:03:15,366
You know, generally, if you want to buy a suit, a more expensive suit is better.

1590
02:03:16,233 --> 02:03:16,800
But not always.

1591
02:03:17,333 --> 02:03:18,200
People hack this, right?

1592
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:19,200
Yeah, that's right.

1593
02:03:19,233 --> 02:03:23,600
In the online space, they decide to ratchet up the price of something that should have been one tenth or one one hundredth.

1594
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:27,633
I thought this about James Clear's Atomic Habits, it was the best-selling non-fiction

1595
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:29,933
book in the world last year, 2021, and it's great.

1596
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:36,433
And he sold this book for whatever, £8 on Kindle and £12 for a paperback.

1597
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:46,300
If he decided to release an online course of Atomic Habits, 60 days to a new you or

1598
02:03:46,433 --> 02:03:47,366
something, it would have been £500 or £1,000.

1599
02:03:50,833 --> 02:03:55,700
So there's this odd tension now that's happening between people who have the capacity to improve

1600
02:03:55,733 --> 02:04:00,733
other people's lives where I know a lot of authors who are coming into the writing space

1601
02:04:00,833 --> 02:04:05,366
from the online course space that they're thinking right okay well I've made the money

1602
02:04:06,100 --> 02:04:13,733
now because there is so much disproportionate fee that people are prepared to pay for an online course.

1603
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:19,433
The reason I think this is the case is because people are looking for outcomes with a lot

1604
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:25,100
Of personal development books and they feel that they are closer to the outcome by doing a course because it's going to be more applied

1605
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:34,800
Well, it's also the case that hardly anyone reads and listening and watching is way more accessible to people way more like ten times more and

1606
02:04:35,866 --> 02:04:40,300
This is actually going to start it is already affecting that the author market

1607
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:43,066
I would say I mean I talked to Sam Harris about this a while back

1608
02:04:43,333 --> 02:04:48,766
But whether he was writing something and he told me I hope I get this right and certainly not a criticism of Sam in any

1609
02:04:48,866 --> 02:04:52,100
case, that the opportunity cost is too high.

1610
02:04:53,033 --> 02:04:57,900
I mean, look with the video, the video we're making right now, it's probably going to be watched by a million people.

1611
02:04:58,533 --> 02:05:02,166
If I wanted to write another book that reached a million people, it would take me two years

1612
02:05:02,333 --> 02:05:07,133
of writing, and then a year of marketing, and the probability that will happen even

1613
02:05:07,233 --> 02:05:13,800
though I'm already a successful author is still extremely low, whereas we can do this in two hours and reach a million people.

1614
02:05:14,233 --> 02:05:15,866
Was it Sam said he's perpetually

1615
02:05:16,633 --> 02:05:19,900
Perpetually finding more urgent things to do right something like that, right?

1616
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:26,300
Right, right and and I mean that the degree and the rapidity of communication online is insane.

1617
02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:26,733
Think about your

1618
02:05:27,966 --> 02:05:32,700
Who was the guy that you did that? What watched you do the lecture series on in Nashville?

1619
02:05:32,966 --> 02:05:34,933
He was the Piaget Piaget.

1620
02:05:34,966 --> 02:05:35,900
Yeah, right.

1621
02:05:35,900 --> 02:05:37,733
How long that take to two half days

1622
02:05:39,033 --> 02:05:43,100
Plus prep three something like that three half days plus a week of prep or something right that right?

1623
02:05:44,366 --> 02:05:46,166
Right how allows man?

1624
02:05:46,166 --> 02:05:47,133
Yes, absolutely.

1625
02:05:47,166 --> 02:05:49,833
Well, and and and then there's no leg to publication

1626
02:05:50,766 --> 02:05:57,300
Right and and it's an ever-growing platform and it's accessible to ten times as many people and it's just as permanent as a book now

1627
02:05:57,500 --> 02:05:59,066
You might say why ever write a book?

1628
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:01,466
That's actually a real question.

1629
02:06:01,466 --> 02:06:02,000
It's a question.

1630
02:06:02,033 --> 02:06:03,433
I've asked myself because

1631
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:07,700
Some of the themes that I'm exploring in my next book.

1632
02:06:07,700 --> 02:06:10,400
I've already talked about in YouTube videos.

1633
02:06:10,433 --> 02:06:12,633
Let's say and they've had quite a explosive

1634
02:06:13,666 --> 02:06:16,566
Reaction to some of the ideas.

1635
02:06:16,566 --> 02:06:18,533
I talked about the nature of the crucifixion and

1636
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:24,766
And the snake the relationship between the image of the crucifixion and the image of the snake

1637
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:27,466
I talked about that on Rogan and that was like two weeks ago

1638
02:06:27,666 --> 02:06:32,300
And I think probably 500,000 people have seen that clip like that's more than a best-selling book

1639
02:06:33,633 --> 02:06:41,433
Instantly, so why am I writing the book and answer is there's nothing that requires you to think more deeply than to write a book

1640
02:06:42,133 --> 02:06:48,166
And so there's still an intellectual advantage to that and a lot of the things that I'm able to say so quickly

1641
02:06:48,633 --> 02:06:53,233
Let's say like I did on Rogan, you know, it took 30 years to think because you've wrote those

1642
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:54,400
Exactly.

1643
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:57,433
Well, I find this my newsletter I do it once a week and

1644
02:06:59,566 --> 02:07:02,133
It synthesizes whatever I've learned over the last seven days, right?

1645
02:07:02,300 --> 02:07:06,233
It takes me, you know a couple of hours to write or whatever and it's less than a thousand words

1646
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:08,733
you can read it in three minutes three minute Monday, mm-hmm and

1647
02:07:09,866 --> 02:07:09,966
and

1648
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:15,766
So much of the stuff that I value now that I talk about with friends or on podcasts is something that imposter adaptation

1649
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:17,500
You know that was something I've been thinking about.

1650
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:19,333
I wonder if I can write this right in 500 words

1651
02:07:19,900 --> 02:07:24,733
I wonder if I can get it down in casual language, but there's it concrete eyes is what you do

1652
02:07:24,966 --> 02:07:27,666
This is why I say people that don't have an outlet where?

1653
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:30,766
Definitely if they don't have conversations

1654
02:07:30,866 --> 02:07:36,866
But also potentially if they don't have the right unity to write about what they think about what they think is that you just your thoughts

1655
02:07:37,100 --> 02:07:37,900
Just notions.

1656
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:42,866
They're just this it's like a they're low resolution ephemeral very difficult to grasp wishy-washy thing

1657
02:07:43,633 --> 02:07:48,233
Put it into words outside of your brain and put it into words say it to someone or write it to someone

1658
02:07:48,966 --> 02:07:51,333
See what happens then it concrete izes things.

1659
02:07:51,333 --> 02:07:53,733
Well, it also edits it because so when you're writing

1660
02:07:54,733 --> 02:07:57,166
part of it is revelatory you write down what you think but

1661
02:07:58,133 --> 02:08:00,766
You select what you think from the multitude of revelations

1662
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:06,000
You don't write down everything you think because you can't so you have to select right away and that's editing and then when you

1663
02:08:06,633 --> 02:08:12,666
Actually technically edit what you've written the same thing happens you shrink it you you organize it you make it coherent you get rid of

1664
02:08:12,733 --> 02:08:18,933
What's irrelevant and so that's tightens up your thinking and then if you're speaking with someone about what you're thinking

1665
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:22,100
It's the same thing because they'll object or they'll reward some of it

1666
02:08:22,333 --> 02:08:26,700
And so that's all that dialogue is some of it's the generation of new ideas

1667
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:34,033
But a tremendous amount of it is editing what what's already you've already revealed to yourself in this very vague sort of dreamlike way

1668
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,333
Anything you want to say before we finish up?

1669
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:45,000
I'd like to thank everybody who's watching and listening and to thank you and your crew for making this possible

it's a straightforward interview with no tricks and

1673
02:08:57,533 --> 02:09:02,333
So that's not an easy thing to manage and I appreciate the opportunity and that's about that

1674

Jordan Peterson博士 欢迎来到本节目

1687
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,233
嗨 Chris

1688
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:31,733
很高兴见到你

1689
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:32,966
巡演进行得怎么样

1690
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:34,900
进行得非常好

1691
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:43,266
观众穿着得体 态度极其积极

1692
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:45,033
他们有充分的理由这样做

1693
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:50,400
从最好的意义上来说 是非政治性的

1694
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:52,000
热情欢迎

1695
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,133
剧院座无虚席

1696
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,333
讲座进行得好极了 甚至非常好

1697
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:07,233
之后我花时间与人们见面 就像在参加婚礼庆典一样

1698
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,666
我会说那是我能想到的最贴切的比喻 你是什么意思 嗯 就像你去参加一个婚礼

1699
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,833
通常会遇到很多你不认识的人 而且能在那里的每个人都很高兴

1700
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:21,266
而且他们都穿得很好 因为他们特意为这个场合而打扮 这是一个积极的事件

1701
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:37,266
那就是我能想到的最贴近的类比来描述发生的事情 而且在场的人都是...

1702
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:40,966
他们试图把自己的生活整理好 而且他们确实在整理 它有效果

1703
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,000
所以 从根本上来说 关于它的一切都是尽可能地积极的

1704
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,633
是的 一切进展顺利 我看到你去了特斯拉工厂

1705
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:56,033
见到Elon Musk后你有什么想法 你有机会多和他交谈吗

1706
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,200
我认为没有谈很多 我们大概总共谈了20分钟 并不完全是私下的 因为还有其他人在场

1707
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,766
这仅仅只能让你对像马斯克这样的人略知一二

1708
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:13,833
因为他是一个了不起的人 而且只有上帝知道 考虑到一切 他的情况如何

1709
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:20,266
我们看了他的新卡车 他带人出去试驾 我没有出去试驾

1710
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,866
那卡车是一件了不起的工程设计作品

1711
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:25,133
工厂非常巨大

1712
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,666
你知道 对于一个人造出了功能性电动汽车然后将它发射到太空的人 你能说什么呢

1713
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,366
他是个独一无二的人 但我觉得一切都进行得很顺利

1714
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:37,800
那是一个非常有趣的晚上

1715
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:43,600
所以我很高兴能在那里 你知道 虽然在交谈刚开始的时候我们有些绕圈子

1716
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,033
但一切都很好

1717
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:48,366
你们在推特上互动多吗

1718
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,066
看起来是这样的

1719
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:49,266
是的

1720
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:50,800
你觉得这是为什么

1721
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,533
你们为什么会聚在一起

1722
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:55,100
我不知道

1723
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,066
我真的不知道

1724
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,200
我们都很知名 我想在某种程度上

1725
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,933
这增加了那种聚合的可能性

1726
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,233
但是

1727
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,133
也许他也在关注我

1728
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:11,266
在我看来

1729
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,700
他的目标确实是向上的

1730
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,800
他的目标确实是向上的

1731
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,900
是的 他是不是放了一个

1732
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:20,633
是不是在他发射到太空的汽车驾驶座上放了一个宇航员模型

1733
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:22,133
那当然是可能的

1734
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,800
他有戏剧性的一面

1735
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:29,933
毫无疑问 他还有很好的幽默感 因为用火箭将自己的汽车发射到太空中真的很有趣

1736
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:30,700
那完全是额外的

1737
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,666
那是个相当好的玩笑

1738
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,066
那是什么

1739
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,200
那是什么

1740
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:40,933
这就是为什么像埃隆这样的人已经达到了这个阶段 即 他能够表达出几乎所有其他CEO无法表达的观点（而不引起重大反弹）

1741
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,700
你知道 他是世界上最富有的人

1742
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,566
我不认为他是达到了那个阶段

1743
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,733
我认为他一直都是这样做的 所以现在他仍然知道怎么做

1744
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:49,833
我的意思是 你知道人们会想

1745
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:54,733
哦 当我受到保护和得到安全之后 我就将会说出我要说的话

1746
00:03:54,766 --> 00:04:00,266
首先 受保护和安全并不会给你勇气去说出你要说的话

1747
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,033
那完全是

1748
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,233
这个理论完全是本末倒置的

1749
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:10,866
你以为你会随着越来越受保护就变得越来越勇敢吗 你以为世界是这样运作的吗

1750
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:18,033
我的意思是 我看到大学教授们认为 某个时刻 随着他们的职业发展 他们会说出他们所想的

1751
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:24,066
但是当他们受保护和安全时 他们花了那么多时间不表达自己的想法 以至于他们甚至不再是原来的自己

1752
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:33,366
他们不知道自己在想什么 所以不 他说他想说的话是因为他一直都是这样做的 像他这样的人都是这样的

1753
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,300
所以

1754
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,700
我假设史蒂夫·乔布斯也是完全一样的

1755
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,066
我的意思是 我认识一些认识他的人

1756
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:44,233
他总是说出他的想法 并且非常直白

1757
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:49,733
这就是为什么苹果产品是科技精湛的奇迹

1758
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:53,833
他有一个难以置信的设计眼光

1759
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
他毫不犹豫地取消整个项目

1760
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,066
当它们不起作用时 他会毫不考虑地这么做

1761
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:04,700
他第二次回到苹果时就这么做了

1762
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,233
精炼整个产品线 取消了大量不同的东西 并说不 专注于此

1763
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:10,566
是的 对 对

1764
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,633
所以那是证明

1765
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:16,033
我的意思是 也许第一次是运气 但第二次回来并再次做到时（就不是运气了）

1766
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,800
第二次非常清楚地显示了这一点

1767
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,733
埃隆也是一样的 对吧

1768
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:25,266
他将自己所做的事情精简到几个非常非常紧密的参数

1769
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:31,400
现在他似乎虽然他组建的企业非常高效运作

1770
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:40,933
我的意思是 创造出一个实际上有竞争力的汽车子行业

1771
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:47,166
并且将太空探索的成本降低了10倍 并发明了可重复使用火箭

1772
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,733
并且开发了这种钻探技术 这是奇迹

1773
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,966
他可能是外星人 是的 可能是 还可能是爬行动物人

1774
00:05:57,133 --> 00:06:02,100
美国的汽车公司我认为没有破产的是福特和特斯拉

1775
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:07,500
而特斯拉几次都差点儿破产 嗯嗯 是的 这是惊人的成就

1776
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,000
所以对于我来说 加油埃隆 他是一个了不起的人

1777
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:23,966
如果我用表情符号的话 你会用什么颜色的皮肤表情符号 如果我用的话 那会是黑色的 为什么不呢

1778
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:32,200
这太荒谬了 所有这些 你知道

1779
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:41,133
发生在罗根身上的所有这种愚蠢 围绕种族的这一切强调 我们可以被简化为我们的种族、我们的民族、我们的性别身份

1780
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:47,200
这是如此令人震惊 如此具有破坏性

1781
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:56,966
我有很多原因表达我对加拿大强制言论法律的政治立场

1782
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,700
我有很多原因让人们知道我对此的看法

1783
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:18,933
其中一个原因是我的政府引入了一个法案 要求我以某种特定方式发言 这在西方民主国家的历史上是前所未有的行动

1784
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:22,833
美国人在1942年严格地认为这是违宪的

1785
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,766
所以这是部分原因

1786
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:38,066
部分原因是我知道这种自上而下的强制性信仰 围绕性别认同的混乱

1787
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:43,500
是一种积极的现象 提供那样的自由 比如说

1788
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:58,766
我知道 每救助一个人 就会有成千上万的人 主要是女孩 因为性别和性别认同的混乱而陷入某种心理传染

1789
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:00,833
我了解心理传染的文献

1790
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,233
它的细节相当清晰

1791
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:02,700
那是什么

1792
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,866
什么是心理传染

1793
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,666
你可以将它们视为心理流行病

1794
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:15,166
所以最后一个 任何实质大小的最后一个是1980年代的撒旦式日托惊恐

1795
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:21,633
你可能年纪不够大 不记得那件事

1796
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:33,266
但在美国刑事司法历史上判出的最长刑期通常是对那些被指控晚发性女性性侵儿童的妇女

1797
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:46,100
在日托中心 FBI发明了这个全新的犯罪者类别 因为晚发性女性儿童性侵犯者并不存在

1798
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:56,000
但是有妇女因被假定参与这些撒旦式日托虐待仪式

1799
00:08:56,733 --> 00:09:04,800
而获得了数百年的监禁刑期 这就像撒冷女巫审判一样席卷整个国家 但规模更大

1800
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:11,000
有一本叫《撒旦的沉默》的书 由一名律师和社会工作者编写 记录了这一切

1801
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:12,066
这简直难以置信

1802
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:24,133
有关于地下隧道的故事 孩子们被带到地下 遭受一切你能想到的事情 都是以撒旦仪式的名义发生的

1803
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:33,600
这是一种传染 这些事情发生了 它发生在自残行为上 发生在饮食失调上

1804
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,666
这几乎全都发生在女孩身上 因为她们是最容易受到这种影响的青少年女孩

1805
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,633
在弗洛伊德时代 他们称之为歇斯底里

1806
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:52,233
但有一本书 作者是亨利·艾伦伯格 名为《无意识的发现》 追溯了大约300年的心因性流行病 我知道这一点

1807
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:59,033
你知道 青春期的人 特别是某些性格类型的人

1808
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,733
难以适应稳定的身份

1809
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:10,633
由于各种原因 可能是高负面情绪 这与低自尊心有关

1810
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,033
这些或多或少是同一件事 也很可能是高特质开放性

1811
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,800
这是创造力的维度 高特质开放性的人

1812
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:25,466
他们更可能有绿色和红色的头发 很多穿孔和很多纹身

1813
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:31,466
以某种非标准的方式着装 可以说这都与创造性行为有关

1814
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:38,500
他们在形成一个单一身份上有困难 然后如果你加入了类别上的混乱--

1815
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:51,266
这正是你在宣称有无穷无尽的性别身份时所做的--那么那些容易身份解离和易受心理传染的人

1816
00:10:53,900 --> 00:11:03,100
你就会摧毁他们 阿比盖尔·施莱尔在她的书《不可逆损伤》中非常好地记录了这一点

1817
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:08,500
女孩远多于男孩 成千上万的她们

1818
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:18,900
所以你可能会想 也许有一些跨性别的人从这个新现实中受益 但对于每一个受益者 你知道

1819
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:24,966
我想看到数据 显示他们实际上受益了多少 而这将需要很长时间来积累

1820
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:28,166
有一千人被这摧毁了

1821
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:31,966
那么还有什么

1822
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,466
嗯 基本上就是政治前线上的情况 我可以看到这一切即将来临

1823
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:41,300
当他们制定立法时 我向加拿大参议院谈论了这个问题

1824
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,033
他们没有听

1825
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:44,266
他们只是认为种族主义、偏见、性别歧视

1826
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:46,300
就像是 随你们怎么想

1827
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:53,400
但是 你知道的 那些突然出现性别不安并且通过自我毁容、服用激素

1828
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:59,966
从而给自己、家庭乃至更广泛的文化造成混乱的女孩们 这又怎么办呢 

1829
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,500
那些如此觉醒和宽容的人 你认为他们会在乎这些后果吗

1830
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,000
他们正投身于其他一些高尚的事业

1831
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:11,366
所以

1832
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,666
谈谈你对现代约会市场的看法

1833
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:20,066
嗯 从某种意义上说 我太老了 没有什么看法 至少不是从个人角度

1834
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,100
我不是很了解细节 你知道的

1835
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:31,000
我确实知道在一些大学里可能发生的一些事情

1836
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:35,733
那里女生比男生 或者说女性比男性多

1837
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,500
这些机构里会发生什么

1838
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:41,933
看起来是这样的

1839
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:42,900
可能吧

1840
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:54,166
所以女性是择偶上移的 这意味着她们会在社会经济层级和心理层级中寻找伴侣 但实际上 能力层级是这一切的基础

1841
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:03,066
所以 当你设定一个女性远多于男性的场景时 比如说在可能发生择偶选择的地方

1842
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:08,933
大多数男性仍然表现不佳 因为他们大多数还是被女性拒绝

1843
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:15,100
但是少数男性表现非常好 如果你认为表现好意味着拥有无限的性接触的话

1844
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:23,333
所以在大学里发生的是 少数男性在某种意义上拥有性自由

1845
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:32,666
而大多数男性和大多数年轻男性一直处于的位置一样 即他们对女性来说并不特别有吸引力

1846
00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:38,733
然后女性当然感到非常沮丧 因为对于她们真正想要与之建立长期关系的那少数男性

1847
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:43,500
对那些男性来说 是卖方市场

1848
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:44,233
他们不会安定下来

1849
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:45,966
那是性比假说

1850
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:48,000
反过来也是一样 对吧

1851
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,633
你会看到 无论哪个性别更稀缺 就能决定游戏规则

1852
00:13:53,400 --> 00:14:00,133
所以 如果男性因为供不应求而需求量大 你就会得到更多短期配对

1853
00:14:00,266 --> 00:14:07,666
你会看到女性关系满意度的增加 当情况相反时

1854
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:14,266
你会得到更多约会后才发生性行为 你会得到更多长期配对

1855
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:20,066
你也会在男性过剩和女性稀缺的情况下 看到更多性暴力

1856
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,133
你也会得到更多不稳定的社会

1857
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:28,133
几年前 因为我的有关强制一夫一妻制的评论而遭到严厉批评

1858
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:33,133
因为它们被断章取义并以现在常见的方式被歪曲

1859
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:34,866
你的意思是什么

1860
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:47,133
我的意思是 一个人类普遍现象是构建社会来既强制又奖励一夫一妻制

1861
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,266
这背后有各种各样的原因

1862
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,233
因为从根本上来说 这是最佳的长期解决方案

1863
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:57,800
但其中一个原因是 当女性稀缺时 男性会变得暴力

1864
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:03,366
现在 你知道 这被解读为我认为这个社会应该把女性分配给不值得的男性

1865
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:14,466
这当然是绝对荒谬的 与我所说或所想或任何一个理智的人会想或说的东西完全无关 因为我不知道是否

1866
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:38,100
有任何政治人物曾经疯狂到认为国家应该这样将女性分配给男性 这是从未发生过的事情 所以被指控持有这种观点 然后这种观点被认为是我的观点之一 这些只是发生在我身上的众多荒唐事之一

1867
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:42,633
“强制一夫一妻制”确实是个不幸的名字 因为它来自人类学术语 对吗

1868
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:52,766
但你的意思是文化所赞扬的一夫一妻制 文化和规范在支持人们并将其提升为一种制度

1869
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:55,733
既有支持也有惩罚 但主要是支持

1870
00:15:56,166 --> 00:16:07,600
惩罚在于对某些行为施加道德反对 比如出轨、尤其是婚姻背叛

1871
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:11,766
特别是背着配偶偷偷摸摸的

1872
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:18,200
即使你处在一段长期稳定的关系中 这种状态也某种程度上是被强制的 

1873
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:22,866
这种强制不是靠穿重靴的警察实施的 但这并不是唯一形式的强制 

1874
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:32,333
这不是唯一形式的制裁、威胁、惩罚、剥夺、厌恶、轻视、羞耻、挫败感或失望 所有这些都涉及其中 

1875
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:41,900
所有这些因素加在一起 因为虽然一夫一妻制是一个理想的长期解决方案 但如果你有其他选项 从某种意义上来说 

1876
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:52,733
它又是一个问题多多的短期解决方案 因此 所有这些社会支持的因素 可以说 都需要到位 

1877
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:03,566
也就是说 据我通过查看人类学文献所能确定的 围绕一夫一妻制的规范是人类普遍存在的 

1878
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:09,900
有例外 但那些例外有非常具体的情境原因

1879
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,300
你看到几周前ONS发布的数据了吗 首次

1880
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:18,566
自从有记录以来 50.1%的女性到30岁时没有孩子

1881
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:24,466
30岁时没有孩子的女性比有孩子的女性多 这是第一次

1882
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:31,300
所以 这是有人剪辑了我一个播客的一部分

1883
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:38,166
我相信是我在讨论我们的社会对19岁或18岁的女性做了什么 19岁的女性

1884
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:47,233
我们一直在对她们撒谎 你知道 第一个谎言是没有什么比你的职业更重要 或多或少这是定义上的

1885
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,833
所以那是第一个谎言

1886
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:53,566
第二个谎言是 你的生活中 没有什么*将*会比你的职业更重要

1887
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,533
所以那是第二个谎言

1888
00:17:55,533 --> 00:18:02,266
接着第三个谎言是 你的生活中 没有什么*应该*比你的职业更重要 所以那是第三个谎言 然后

1889
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:15,400
这其中隐含的观点是 孩子是一种负担 而且认为女性应该生孩子是压迫性的父权制的一部分 应该被抵制 以及

1890
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:21,800
男性有什么权利告诉我我能对我的身体做什么 嘿 公平的说 等等

1891
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:29,133
现在我一生都在女性主导的职业领域工作

1892
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:34,166
例如 我曾经是一名日托工作者

1893
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:43,600
回到1980年左右 那时候没有男性做这个 但我真的很喜欢孩子 所以那很有趣

1894
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:48,966
我还在艾伯塔的社会服务部门工作 是儿童保育部门 然后

1895
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:51,800
之后我一直以心理学家的身份工作

1896
00:18:53,033 --> 00:19:02,566
无论是培训还是作为心理学家 从那时起一直到现在 那一直是一个女性主导的行业 随着时间的推移越来越多 但即使是我刚刚进入这个领域时也是

1897
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:03,866
所以我

1898
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:11,966
我坚定地处于女性进入职场的一代中 我从未经历过那个世界

1899
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:22,400
所以我观察了女性在职业生涯的每个阶段从最低到最高的进展 并观察了发生了什么

1900
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,266
相对而言 我会说是没有偏见的 因为我不知道

1901
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:40,466
我看到的是 随着女性接近三十岁的晚些时候 不 是二十多岁晚期 她们会有一种心理转变

1902
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,900
心理转变发生了 那就是她们对职业的重视减少了

1903
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,966
特别是对生孩子的重视大大增加

1904
00:19:53,700 --> 00:20:00,366
这通常在29或30岁左右达到危机点 对绝大多数女性来说 她们的态度发生了转变 我见过许多女性发生了非常戏剧性的转变

1905
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:11,933
我想最有力的证据就是

1906
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:17,600
我曾经与多伦多的高端律师合作过大约十年

1907
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,200
我是一个组织的一部分

1908
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:28,133
我们去到高端律师事务所 说 把你们能力最强的人员送来 我们会帮助他们解决他们生活中可能还存在的任何问题

1909
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:34,566
对他们的好处是生活会变得更顺利 对你们的好处是他们会更加高效

1910
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:44,733
有一个好的管理格言是要最多关注你能力最强的人员 因为他们超额地带来了你大部分的收入

1911
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:51,600
所以我与男性和女性合作 他们都处于职业生涯的巅峰 在一个非常困难的行业中

1912
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,566
这些女性通常非常有吸引力 身体状况良好

1913
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:05,400
心理相对稳定 极其尽责 非常非常聪明

1914
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:13,833
并且从初中一直到高中 大学 法学院

1915
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,266
再到顶级律师事务所 迅速晋升 到了29或30岁时就成为全职合伙人

1916
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,066
所有的律师事务所 全部的女性都退出了 全部

1917
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
律师事务所无法留住她们

1918
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:32,566
我真的很感兴趣 我和这些女性就这个话题进行了很多很多的交谈

1919
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:40,700
因为我知道律师事务所在竭尽全力 想尽各种办法试图留住这些女性--他们为什么不想呢

1920
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,266
仅仅出于贪婪的资本家足够了--

1921
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,366
我们不想失去这些高绩效的女性 因为她们在最高水平上表现出色

1922
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,366
但他们无法留住她们 这些女性想要朝九晚五的工作

1923
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:58,233
她们想要一个能让她们拥有生活的工作 尤其是当她们开始对生孩子感兴趣或者已经有孩子后

1924
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:04,500
她们真正意识到的是一个非常有趣的观点 所以

1925
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,533
因为她们是高度尽责的女性 她们做好了自己的本分

1926
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:13,800
努力工作 勤勉不懈 不抬头提问题

1927
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,633
她们在初中

1928
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,400
她们得到了最好的成绩

1929
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,366
她们在高中

1930
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,933
她们得到了最好的成绩 以此类推 一直到

1931
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,466
直到她们达到合伙人的地位 但那是一种顶峰 对吧 你成为一家大律师事务所的合伙人

1932
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,466
就像你在你的职业生涯中达到了顶点

1933
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,300
那么 接下来呢

1934
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:37,833
于是她们环顾四周 思考 嗯 我现在和所有这些愿意为了保持顶尖地位而每周工作80小时不停歇的超级有竞争力的男性在一起

1935
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:43,533
他们完全愿意做到这一点

1936
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,600
他们到底在做什么 因为那才是真正的问题

1937
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:49,100
是什么呢

1938
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:54,100
是什么特点定义了这小部分极具竞争力的男性

1939
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:54,366
这不是

1940
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,733
你可以假设那就是每个人都应该是的样子

1941
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,466
但首先 并不是每个人都是那样的 或者你可以反过来说 嗯

1942
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,066
只有少数人愿意这样做 每周工作满满八十小时

1943
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,533
我的意思是 他们当然是为此获得报酬的

1944
00:23:09,566 --> 00:23:11,000
我们不要对此有任何误解

1945
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,066
但生活的其他方面呢

1946
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:15,233
那就是女性提出的问题

1947
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,066
我为什么要这样做 这是个好问题

1948
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,800
嗯 对于男性来说 答案和对于女性不同

1949
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:26,666
这真的是个完全不同的答案 并不是说男性真的在思考这个问题

1950
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:30,100
这更多是男性动机的一个固有部分

1951
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:39,400
作为男性 你越成功 女性越喜欢你 但你现在面临的问题是

1952
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,966
随着女性获得更好的教育、更多的就业机会、更高的地位和声望

1953
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:49,166
她们使自己失去了找到有吸引力的伴侣的能力 因为女性在支配层次上升

1954
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,066
这是能力的更高层次

1955
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:52,166
抱歉

1956
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:54,933
谁会告诉女性

1957
00:23:56,166 --> 00:24:00,900
你最近刚刚获得的机会平等

1958
00:24:01,933 --> 00:24:05,600
实际上 这使你更难找到你根本上感到吸引的伴侣

1959
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,766
是的 它确实做了很多事情

1960
00:24:08,766 --> 00:24:15,333
我的意思是 它确实为女性在经济方面提供了更多的机会 

1961
00:24:16,566 --> 00:24:24,200
它确实减少了她们在经济安全和教育女性方面对伴侣的依赖 

1962
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:27,266
愿意教育女性的国家 

1963
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,933
那是他们未来经济成功的最佳预测指标

1964
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:37,500
所以如果你观察发展中国家 想要找出哪个因素最有可能预测他们的经济将继续繁荣

1965
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:41,500
那就是他们对女性教育的态度 但还有几点

1966
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:55,700
女性的教育水平预测了她们孩子的教育水平 但男性的教育水平却没有 所以这也是一个重要的跨代效应 我发布了一个视频

1967
00:24:55,733 --> 00:24:57,166
我本想总结那个故事

1968
00:24:57,166 --> 00:25:03,533
我发布了一个视频或者有人发布了一段我谈论我们刚刚讨论的一些事情的剪辑

1969
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:08,566
它在YouTube短视频上发布 一个月内获得了大约500万的观看次数

1970
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:16,533
评论区难以置信的充满恶意 每一条评论都充满了恶意 都是来自女性

1971
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:21,600
就像“这个老白人混蛋是谁 告诉我们我们应该怎么对待我们的身体” 你知道

1972
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:23,366
我并没有评判

1973
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,666
我只是说了我对你说的话 就是我观察了女性

1974
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,866
在我一生的整个过程中 我会说是以一种充满爱心的方式

1975
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,366
我爱我的妹妹 我爱我的妻子 我有一个女儿 我爱我的母亲

1976
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,666
总的来说 我对女性很满意

1977
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:41,466
对于“她们应该如何过她们的生活” 我没有任何意见

1978
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,300
我甚至不知道她们应该如何过她们的生活

1979
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:50,633
我看到了发生的事情 我也观察到了那些到了29或30岁然后不能怀孕的女性发生的事情

1980
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:59,733
那不是我希望任何人遇到的命运 这是可怕的 30%的夫妇遇到了这个问题 30%的夫妇有困难怀孕

1981
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:08,633
这是一个很大的比例 而且随着年龄增长 你遇到怀孕困难的概率会增加 所以 你知道 这就是生活

1982
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:18,633
但对我来说非常有趣的是看到这些评论有多么尖酸刻薄 以及这种情况有多么普遍 因为通常在我的YouTube频道上

1983
00:26:20,266 --> 00:26:24,300
95%的评论是积极的 而这完全相反

1984
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,433
所以你在一开始就提到了这个 你说现在50%的女性

1985
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:37,100
30岁时50.1%没有孩子 是的 这不好

1986
00:26:37,366 --> 00:26:45,800
这是整个文化在极其深层次上存在的某些严重问题的迹象 我不认为女性需要把这看作是

1987
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:56,466
我们试图告诉女性她们应该或不应该做什么 但我认为很公平地说 你需要是一个非常独特的女性 你到了50岁没有家庭

1988
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,266
回头看看 觉得是的 我做对了 这并不是说那些女性不存在

1989
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:06,266
她们绝对存在 我认识其中一些人 但我认为总的来说 这就像是

1990
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:20,866
对每个人来说都是一样 这又是一个例子 显示了我们的文化如何彻底失去了方向 那么生活是什么呢 你有一份工作或职业

1991
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:28,366
洗碗自己是有能力的 并为社区做出贡献 为自己和家人提供生活必需品 这是你生活的四分之一

1992
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:39,066
或三分之一之类的东西 你有亲密关系 你有家庭 那就是生活 如果你没有其中之一

1993
00:27:39,233 --> 00:27:42,366
那就是你生活中没有的三分之一 现在有些人可能在其他两个方面做得很好 他们可以应对没有那个 或者他们在一个方面做得如此之好

1994
00:27:42,433 --> 00:27:48,466
他们可以应对没有其他两个的补偿

1995
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,100
是的 可能

1996
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,966
这很难 因为如果你想要一个伟大的职业生涯 如果你独自一人没有家庭 那很难做到

1997
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:00,233
对

1998
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:04,333
我的意思是 从我所见 全方位考虑下来 生活状况最好的人--

1999
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:09,800
即使与他们的职业相关--也有一段相当稳固的一夫一妻制关系

2000
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:16,200
这种关系稳定了他们 然后他们有一个家庭也稳定了他们并拓宽了他们的生活

2001
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:24,866
你知道 非凡的人做非凡的事情 这很好 但他们是按定义来说的例外

2002
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,466
他们是极小的少数

2003
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:33,266
这总是保守派和自由派之间的争论 因为自由派有时更倾向于

2004
00:28:34,466 --> 00:28:35,233
你怎么说呢

2005
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:40,400
对于非凡之事的同情或赞赏

2006
00:28:40,433 --> 00:28:44,033
当然 非凡之事是必需的

2007
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,600
但平均来看

2008
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,266
大家通常做的就是应该做的事情

2009
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,533
所以你只需要看看 人们通常做什么

2010
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:59,033
如果他们有工作或职业 有亲密的关系 有一个家庭

2011
00:28:59,066 --> 00:28:59,766
如果你没有这些

2012
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,766
其中任何一样 那你就更难了

2013
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,700
这并不意味着你不能做到 甚至也不一定意味着你不应该尝试

2014
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:15,333
但作为一个默认假设 这完全是愚蠢的

2015
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:18,133
你还能用你的生活做什么呢

2016
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:19,566
好吧 也许你非常有创造力

2017
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:26,833
当然 你知道 那也极为罕见 同样受到幂律问题的影响

2018
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,200
即使你非常有创造力 你在经济上取得成功的概率也极其

2019
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:37,700
极其微小 几乎不存在

2020
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,433
这是如此困难

2021
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:43,700
当然 这确实会发生 如果你成功了 你可以获得惊人的成功

2022
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:51,466
但是 你昨晚是不是说 在最近出版的10万本书中 只有1000本销量超过了百万

2023
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,933
是的 差不多是那样

2024
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:54,233
它在各处都是幂律

2025
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:56,700
是的 到处都是幂律

2026
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:03,966
你知道的 少数人做了所有的工作 少数人获得了所有的好处 少数运动员进了所有的球

2027
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,600
少数男性得到了所有的女性 等等 少数恒星拥有了所有的质量

2028
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:15,866
少数河流拥有了所有的水 少数城市拥有了所有的人口 等等 等等

2029
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:22,700
到处都是 你知道的 我们的文化如此无知 以至于我们把这归咎于资本主义

2030
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:23,000
就像是

2031
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,433
这怎么能解释恒星的质量呢 人们

2032
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:32,166
或者你知道的 河流的体积 或者城市的人口密度 或者

2033
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,900
向前推进时间 你和埃隆·马斯克最近在推特上谈到了人口崩溃

2034
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:41,566
你认为会发生什么 哦 好吧 我至少十年来一直认为

2035
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,700
50年后最大的问题将是人太少了 我记得

2036
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:51,266
几年前听你说过你认为我们会在大约90亿左右达到顶峰 是的

2037
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:57,266
我们可能不会达到90亿 是的 我了解这些统计数据 因为想想看

2038
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:04,400
我们现在可能正生活在地球上 这个时候可能是将会存在的最多人数的时期

2039
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,133
是的 这是非常有可能的

2040
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:13,033
你知道 发达国家的人口崩溃是急剧的 对吧

2041
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,833
就像我们掉下了悬崖

2042
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:18,333
因为就像大家从疫情中知道的那样 基本传染数R0

2043
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,233
如果较少的人在繁殖 下一代 你就有更少的人去繁殖

2044
00:31:27,366 --> 00:31:40,533
好吧 我大约10年前参加了联合国的一个委员会 以帮助起草联合国秘书长关于可持续经济发展的报告

2045
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,966
所以我研究了各种各样的事情

2046
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,800
我非常好奇 例如 因为人们从1960年代开始就一直在敲打人口过剩的鼓

2047
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:53,933
你知道 因为那时有可怕的预言

2048
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:56,100
到了2000年 罗马俱乐部出来说

2049
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:03,433
会有骚乱、大规模饥荒、大规模移民潮和所有你听说过关于气候变化的事情

2050
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,266
因为地球上的人太多了 但这根本就没有发生

2051
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:10,900
那不仅仅是错误 它是完全相反的真相

2052
00:32:11,066 --> 00:32:12,366
它是完全错误的

2053
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:21,466
相反 每个人都变得更加富裕 而经济分配底层的人口被提升脱离了贫困

2054
00:32:21,866 --> 00:32:24,533
不平等依然存在 但那是幂律现象

2055
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:26,333
我们已经讨论过了 不是说这很琐碎

2056
00:32:26,566 --> 00:32:34,033
这只是难以置信地难以确定该怎么做 虽然有解决方案 但肯定取消资本主义不是解决方案

2057
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:39,733
所以我研究了人口趋势 首先发现

2058
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:50,933
这不是什么天才行为 但一旦你教育了女性 家庭规模就会急剧缩小 甚至低于更替水平

2059
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,766
这部分是因为女性有了其他选择 这是一个巨大的影响

2060
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,000
哦 是的

2061
00:32:56,366 --> 00:33:01,900
我的意思是 西方所有国家的生育率都远低于更替水平 韩国的生育率远低于更替水平

2062
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,900
日本的生育率远低于更替水平

2063
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:05,166
是的

2064
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:05,500
是的

2065
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:08,700
我认为地球上生育率最高的国家可能是

2066
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,866
乍得（非洲中部的一个国家）——就增长而言——平均每个家庭有八个孩子

2067
00:33:14,266 --> 00:33:17,433
是的 我认为到本世纪末 尼日利亚的人口将超过中国

2068
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:28,433
是的 马斯克是个有远见的人 所以他在看着未来可能出现的末日转角

2069
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,100
噢哦 我们的人口即将耗尽

2070
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:34,466
这当然意味着我们将缺少年轻人 对吧

2071
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:42,800
首先不是老年人消失 因为现在在这里的每个人在30年后都将老去30岁 我们将缺少年轻人

2072
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:53,500
缺少年轻人 当然年轻人是那些进行创新并将承担大部分重任等工作的人 因此将会严重缺少年轻人

2073
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:59,500
你可以从我发布的一些ONS数据看出来 50.1%的女性到30岁时没有孩子

2074
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,400
男性和女性都在回复那条推文说好极了 反正地球上的人太多了

2075
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:07,700
我知道

2076
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:19,066
我在想 这种NPC的愚蠢言论是如此危险 因为它让人们相信他们的言论有可靠的依据

2077
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:19,666
是的

2078
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:19,900
是的

2079
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,966
这个想法 即地球上的人太多了

2080
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,233
这是

2081
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:30,233
没有比这个声明更隐含的种族灭绝性的情绪了

2082
00:34:32,766 --> 00:34:34,100
所以 你说的“太多人”是什么意思

2083
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:36,066
确切地说

2084
00:34:36,066 --> 00:34:37,100
你说的“地球”是什么意思

2085
00:34:38,066 --> 00:34:41,700
你打算怎么解决这个问题 大规模堕胎吗

2086
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,566
那是你的答案 还是我们应该做些更戏剧性的事情

2087
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:48,633
也许我们只是让人们因为羞耻而不生孩子 我见过人们这么做

2088
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:49,133
确实如此

2089
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:50,933
我在一次TED活动中见过一位教授

2090
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,666
我认为是的

2091
00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:56,900
没关系

2092
00:34:57,266 --> 00:35:00,733
有几位教授在对几百名学生讲话

2093
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:05,166
其中一位是环保活动家型的教授

2094
00:35:05,266 --> 00:35:09,166
他上台对所有年轻人挥舞手指说

2095
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:12,700
他和他的妻子只决定要一个孩子 在我看来 对他来说多了一个

2096
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:21,233
并告诉所有在场的年轻人 如果他们有一点道德良知 他们就会严格限制自己的生育潜力

2097
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:29,466
我站起来说 我认为这是我听过的学术界对年轻人说过的最令人震惊的事情之一

2098
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:36,200
这真的很说明问题 因为他们说了很多令人震惊的事情 那是一个非常尴尬的时刻 他气呼呼地离开了舞台 但

2099
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:44,500
你知道 在一阵狂热中 谈论如何无法在道德上讨论这些事情而不被钉在耻辱柱上 是的 这是肯定的

2100
00:35:45,966 --> 00:35:52,666
你作为一个学术界的使者 你告诉年轻人人性是如此腐败 以至于他们应该认真考虑不繁衍后代

2101
00:35:53,133 --> 00:36:02,833
因为这违反了最深层的道德准则 你认为这是好事 认为这是你的权利 简直难以理解

2102
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:12,700
这难以理解 但它与深根植的存在性自我厌恶相关 我指的是那种

2103
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:19,233
人类就像是地球上的病毒 我们是癌症般的生长 除了斯坦称之为人类种族主义

2104
00:36:19,266 --> 00:36:19,400
嗯嗯

2105
00:36:20,266 --> 00:36:22,166
嗯嗯 对 对 对

2106
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:23,066
就是这样

2107
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,566
我们是地球上的癌症 你知道 不受控制的增长就像癌症

2108
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:29,300
就像我所说的 癌症

2109
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,033
没关系

2110
00:36:30,066 --> 00:36:37,466
我们知道你的心在哪里 因为这样的教义意味着什么 

2111
00:36:37,466 --> 00:36:38,233
你对癌症怎么办

2112
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:40,033
切除它

2113
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:44,533
是的 这是肯定的 毒死它或者 无论如何对癌症你不会什么都不做

2114
00:36:45,766 --> 00:36:47,466
所以如果你要使用这样的比喻

2115
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,733
地球上的人太多了

2116
00:36:48,866 --> 00:36:51,033
你可以用这样的比喻 你知道的

2117
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:56,533
然后你还会认为你在使用这个比喻时是有美德的 因为你站在了地球这边

2118
00:36:56,866 --> 00:36:57,966
不管那是什么意思

2119
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:06,966
所以 是的 这是难以置信的 而且很大一部分根源于这种存在性的羞耻以及

2120
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:13,033
对人类生存条件的恐惧 以及生命充满苦难 很多是不公正的

2121
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:21,000
你知道 这是一种墨菲斯特风格的立场 所以墨菲斯特在歌德的《浮士德》中被描绘

2122
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:27,333
那是一个人为了知识将灵魂卖给魔鬼的故事

2123
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:38,433
这是一个关于智力骄傲的故事 歌德之于德国文学的地位就像莎士比亚之于英国文学一样

2124
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:43,800
歌德的墨菲斯特在剧中直言不讳地说了两次

2125
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:51,366
一次在第一部 有两本书 在第一本书中和第二本书中都有歌德重申了两次

2126
00:37:51,366 --> 00:37:54,633
存在是如此肮脏 因为它充满痛苦 

2127
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,333
基本上 如果它被彻底消灭会更好

2128
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:02,200
这就是墨菲斯特风格的立场

2129
00:38:02,233 --> 00:38:04,433
这一切都应该停止

2130
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:05,800
看看人们有多腐败

2131
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:06,933
到处都是邪恶

2132
00:38:06,966 --> 00:38:08,533
这只是权力意志

2133
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:17,033
我们用我们的无节制野心在摧毁地球 这一切都根植于贪婪和马基雅维利主义以及争夺位置

2134
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:19,966
我们是如此可鄙 我们应该蜷缩、死去

2135
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,133
我们应该羞辱女性 使她们不生孩子 我们应该羞辱男性

2136
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:29,766
以便他们永远不会表现出任何毁灭地球的野心

2137
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,800
这是极其令人震惊的

2138
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,600
这一切都深入到了底层

2139
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:43,400
事物的最底层 这正是撕裂我们文化的东西 这场关于存在本质的争论在最基本层面上进行着

2140
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,366
所以 大学站错了边

2141
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:54,100
谈到个体 我看到阻碍人们前进的一个因素是舒适感

2142
00:38:54,700 --> 00:39:00,933
很容易让生活达到一个阶段 既不那么糟 也不那么好

2143
00:39:01,033 --> 00:39:04,866
至少当你彻底崩溃时 只有一个方向可以去 对吧

2144
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:11,566
你只能从那里向上走 但我认为在一个勉强及格的生活中徘徊多年是可能的 对吧

2145
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
被舒适感麻醉

2146
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,700
我自己也看到了这种诱惑 为了好的而放弃了伟大的

2147
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:20,166
你会对那些试图逃离平庸诅咒的人说什么

2148
00:39:23,633 --> 00:39:28,600
嗯 如果你在某种基本意义上对它感到满意 我的意思是 有一些值得说的

2149
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,466
我想 如果你能维持它 并为自己围绕一个私人空间

2150
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:39,566
在某种程度上从世界的烦恼中解脱出来 维持自己的小小私人花园

2151
00:39:40,366 --> 00:39:43,766
问题在于 外面的蛇往往会渗透进来 对吗

2152
00:39:43,766 --> 00:39:48,200
真正意义上把自己与世界的关切隔离开来是相当困难的

2153
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,700
所以我不清楚那是一个可行的解决方案

2154
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:56,400
这也意味着你可能会为自己缺乏公民参与而找借口

2155
00:39:56,533 --> 00:39:57,600
你知道 我不应该去教堂

2156
00:39:57,733 --> 00:40:01,033
我不应该参与政治过程 因为这一切都太腐败了

2157
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:08,166
我应该躲避媒体前线不断产生的所有烦人噪音

2158
00:40:08,233 --> 00:40:13,533
我对这种观点有一些同情 但我不相信这真的可能 因为

2159
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:24,033
你无法拥有一个独立于更广泛社会健康的独立园地 这是不可能的 也许你可以拥有它

2160
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:34,500
在很短的时间内 但如果你对你所拥有的感到满意 而且是真正的满意 那我认为可以

2161
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,200
但通常不是这样的 我认为大多数情况下 人们已经被安抚了

2162
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,033
你知道 他们忘记了自己的梦想 但他们忘记了...

2163
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:43,366
平克·弗洛伊德的《舒适地麻木》就是关于这个的 对吗

2164
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,400
他们变得舒适

2165
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:45,433
麻木

2166
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:49,500
我认为大多数人……我有这样一个朋友 这个故事真的打动了我

2167
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:59,966
所以在疫情期间经营播客 我能够拥有我认为自己擅长的东西 我的艺术追求和出口

2168
00:40:59,966 --> 00:41:01,366
这让我能够继续

2169
00:41:01,366 --> 00:41:04,233
实际上产量增加了 因为我没有其他事情要做

2170
00:41:04,233 --> 00:41:07,900
我有一个朋友是理发师 他在一家超市找到了一份工作

2171
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,133
理发店关闭了很长一段时间 他在一家超市找到了一份夜间上架的工作

2172
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:14,833
我问他 我说 伙计 你觉得新工作怎么样

2173
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:16,866
这是一个很大的变化

2174
00:41:16,866 --> 00:41:18,766
他说 你知道吗

2175
00:41:18,766 --> 00:41:19,733
我其实不介意工作

2176
00:41:19,766 --> 00:41:22,366
我不介意和我一起工作的人

2177
00:41:22,366 --> 00:41:24,566
但伙计 我想念擅长某件事的感觉

2178
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:25,700
对 对 对

2179
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:25,933
嗯 是的

2180
00:41:26,033 --> 00:41:29,666
伙计 这话深深触动了我

2181
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,300
我想念擅长某事的感觉

2182
00:41:31,866 --> 00:41:38,033
是的 人们需要有机会在某事上变得出色 那么你可能会问自己

2183
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,533
那么 生活的不适感最好的解药是什么 你可能会说是舒适

2184
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:51,233
我想那就是你给婴儿包裹时所做的

2185
00:41:52,533 --> 00:42:04,900
但更好的解药是像追求卓越之类的冒险 相比于单纯的“没有苦难” 这是更好的苦难解药

2186
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:10,166
不是说单纯的“没有苦难”不是... 你知道的

2187
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,833
但要从舒适的麻醉中脱身是困难的 特别是如果你已经习惯了它

2188
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:19,333
是的 那就是“成熟”的难题

2189
00:42:19,366 --> 00:42:23,800
你知道 弗洛伊德学派非常明智地说 好母亲必然会失败

2190
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,933
这是什么意思

2191
00:42:25,933 --> 00:42:31,100
这意味着她停止提供那种舒适 那种舒适是将人们与冒险的需求隔离开来的

2192
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:40,533
我听你最近说过 母亲让她的孩子走出去面对世界 （虽然）知道他们仍然脆弱 （但）现在一切取决于他们自己

2193
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:43,266
只有世界来照顾他们 这是她们能做的最勇敢的事情之一

2194
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:45,866
这是女性的十字架

2195
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:51,233
最佳的例证是 我所见过的最好的表现是

2196
00:42:51,566 --> 00:42:53,533
米开朗基罗的《怜悯》

2197
00:42:53,533 --> 00:43:00,566
这是一尊玛丽亚雕像 她怀里抱着成年的基督的尸体

2198
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:15,400
他被打破并摧毁了 你知道 她在展示这一点 这是母亲的勇敢 允许这种事情发生 不仅如此 还要促使它发生

2199
00:43:15,433 --> 00:43:17,433
所以去吧 孩子

2200
00:43:17,433 --> 00:43:27,333
去哪里呢 去吧 为什么外面那么危险 是的 不用说 外面更危险

2201
00:43:27,433 --> 00:43:34,366
但如果你和我在一起 危险会大很多 所以你可能会在外面世界失去你的身体

2202
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:41,400
但如果你留在这里 你会失去你的灵魂 如果没有母亲在那里推动你前进

2203
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:44,266
作为一个个体 让我们说

2204
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:51,800
你沿着怎样的路径 你知道 卡尔·荣格对恋母情结非常感兴趣

2205
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:58,200
基本上那是过度保护的母性

2206
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:06,133
他批评弗洛伊德的对于母亲行为的假设（过于简化地将某些心理问题归咎于母亲的行为）

2207
00:44:07,266 --> 00:44:09,233
他说这更多是（人际）关系性的

2208
00:44:09,266 --> 00:44:13,600
首先 如果周围有父亲的话 这将是父亲允许发生的事情

2209
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,833
所以 不要忘记允许这种情况发生的父亲的贡献

2210
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:25,700
因为在某种意义上 父亲的角色就是作为那种母性过度保护的对立面

2211
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:32,966
所以一个女人与她的婴儿在零到九个月之间极其紧密的联系 而婴儿完全无助 因此

2212
00:44:33,733 --> 00:44:39,433
完全的同情和提供舒适是唯一重要的工作 这确实是事实

2213
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,633
然后女人在某种程度上需要转变角色

2214
00:44:42,633 --> 00:44:48,800
当孩子开始变得更加活动时 母亲需要转变角色

2215
00:44:49,033 --> 00:44:55,200
基本上和更加独立时 她需要放手 这是一个真正的哀悼过程 并且

2216
00:44:56,266 --> 00:44:59,900
她需要开始促进这种向独立性的转变

2217
00:44:59,966 --> 00:45:07,366
但这是一个困难的转变 所以部分父亲的角色就是要成为孩子独立性的倡导者

2218
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:13,700
也要安慰母亲 让她知道那种安全提供已不再必要

2219
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,233
但也要作为孩子外向性的倡导者

2220
00:45:19,366 --> 00:45:23,933
外向的欲望 所以恋母情结不仅仅是母亲

2221
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:37,466
也包括比如说弱父亲 但还有孩子本身 你可以想象 因为你不相信这些谈判达成的协议是我们之间的关系

2222
00:45:37,466 --> 00:45:40,866
所以 你知道 你六岁 你在一年级

2223
00:45:42,633 --> 00:45:43,966
也许你感觉有点不舒服

2224
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:45,433
也许你没有

2225
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:53,266
也许你在假装有点不舒服的样子 也许你在夸大你有多不舒服 你妈妈下楼来说

2226
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,400
你知道 你今天在学校有个考试

2227
00:45:56,433 --> 00:45:58,133
也许你还没有完全准备好

2228
00:45:58,133 --> 00:46:03,266
也许你知道 你本应该准备好的 她说 但你知道你好像胃痛

2229
00:46:04,533 --> 00:46:08,200
也许你生病了 不能去学校 孩子想

2230
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:15,133
也许我可以就呆在家里 妈妈可以给我掖好被子 我就不用参加那个考试了 也不用面对世界 （所以）他说是的

2231
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,733
是的 我的胃真的很疼 于是我们就这样开始了 孩子做出了选择

2232
00:46:19,033 --> 00:46:26,066
你可能会想 这是一个灾难性的选择 你可能会想 孩子们不应该为那个年龄做出的选择负责

2233
00:46:26,933 --> 00:46:32,366
就像孩子很快就会成为一个需要做出非常相似决定的成年人一样

2234
00:46:41,433 --> 00:46:47,666
选择有后果 为此负责就是纯粹地认识到选择确实有后果 而且它是一个选择 现在 你知道

2235
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,266
你可以说 好吧 95%的责任应该归咎于母亲 也许这是过高的估计

2236
00:46:55,466 --> 00:46:57,000
我认为这很可能是这样的 但

2237
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,533
孩子可以说 妈妈

2238
00:47:00,533 --> 00:47:01,800
你不用担心我

2239
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,200
我会起床去做这个的 而且

2240
00:47:06,233 --> 00:47:06,900
那是选择 而且

2241
00:47:08,633 --> 00:47:13,833
那是正确的选择 所以这些问题显然总是先有鸡还是先有蛋的问题 但是

2242
00:47:15,066 --> 00:47:21,966
这揭示了情况的复杂性 你知道 如果你被引诱走向一条病态的道路

2243
00:47:23,366 --> 00:47:29,733
你可以接受或拒绝邀请 现在有些人在引诱方面更擅长 有些人则执行得更严厉 你知道

2244
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,333
在这样的情况下 有各种各样的个体变异 但是

2245
00:47:33,366 --> 00:47:39,333
但仅仅因为你被提供了诱饵 并不意味着你必须接受它

2246
00:47:41,533 --> 00:47:45,266
我不是一个决定论者 我确实相信人们有自由意志 不管那意味着什么

2247
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,133
这是一个模糊的主题 你越看它就越复杂 但无论如何

2248
00:47:51,566 --> 00:48:01,266
这仍然是一个很好的简化方式来描述我们似乎被诅咒承担自己命运的责任 至少在某种程度上

2249
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,300
你如何建议那些正在处理冒名顶替综合症的人

2250
00:48:06,566 --> 00:48:07,733
哦 每个人都会遇到这个问题

2251
00:48:08,466 --> 00:48:12,100
每当你的地位发生变化 当你向上移动时 当然你会有冒名顶替综合症

2252
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:18,400
因为当你首次转变到一个新角色时 你是一个冒名顶替者 因为你是一个初学者

2253
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:19,666
你不知道你在做什么

2254
00:48:20,466 --> 00:48:22,433
这并不意味着你是个骗子或者假货

2255
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:25,900
这也不意味着你应该伪装成你有更多的知识

2256
00:48:26,866 --> 00:48:30,233
这就是自然所说的 每个伟大的人都是他自己理想的演员

2257
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:37,266
这就是冒名顶替综合症的一种形式 如果你想进入下一个阶段

2258
00:48:37,766 --> 00:48:44,166
在某种程度上 你必须表现得就像你已经在那里了 尽管你刚刚开始 这并不是谎言

2259
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:49,100
你知道 这是意愿性的 它可以并且可能会退化成为谎言

2260
00:48:49,366 --> 00:48:54,366
特别是如果你将自己假装成比你所知道的更多 但如果你位置变化了 你知道

2261
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,333
比如说你从本科生转变成研究生

2262
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:04,933
那么 所有其他的研究生和教授都知道你只是一个刚开始的研究生

2263
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:10,233
他们不会像期待一个更有经验的研究生那样从你这里期待太多

2264
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:17,800
所以你有一些真正的回旋余地 但你确实是那个角色的低层占据者 当然

2265
00:49:17,866 --> 00:49:24,866
如果你有任何理智 你会感觉像是一个冒名顶替者 因为你刚刚到达 你刚刚做出了转变

2266
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,633
但这没关系 你知道 这不是问题

2267
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,300
首先 你必须理解 任何有一点理智且不是自恋的人都会这样感觉

2268
00:49:34,066 --> 00:49:39,233
实际上 这是你的心理健康和你的能力的一个标志 只要这种感觉不变得令人无法承受

2269
00:49:39,933 --> 00:49:40,966
它不应该击倒你

2270
00:49:41,066 --> 00:49:41,866
我真是个虚伪的人

2271
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,633
好吧 不要做一个骗子 这是第一件事

2272
00:49:45,133 --> 00:49:50,733
如果你在和有能力的人打交道 而且你承认你的无知

2273
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:55,200
有能力的人从不因此严厉地评判你 只要你一直在注意听

2274
00:49:56,033 --> 00:50:00,066
所以 比如在我的课堂上 人们常常害怕提问

2275
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:04,666
所以有时我会指着某些人问他们是否有问题 特别是那些比较安静的类型

2276
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,166
他们害怕提问是因为他们在暴露自己的无知

2277
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,366
并且他们会认为自己是房间里唯一那么无知的人 但事实并非如此

2278
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,233
因为如果他们一直在注意听并且有一个问题

2279
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:19,400
那么班上有一半的人也有那个问题的可能性非常高

2280
00:50:19,966 --> 00:50:21,633
如果你没有在注意听 那就不一样了

2281
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:24,233
所以你可以是无知的

2282
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:32,100
你可以是一个无知的新手 你甚至可以问那些在那种位置必须提出的问题 并在一定程度上暴露你的不足

2283
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:36,666
只要你正在和有能力的人打交道 而你一直在注意听

2284
00:50:36,966 --> 00:50:38,633
他们就会回答你的问题

2285
00:50:38,766 --> 00:50:40,400
然后你只需一次无知

2286
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,166
这就是提一个愚蠢问题的意义所在

2287
00:50:45,666 --> 00:50:46,733
你只需问一次

2288
00:50:47,066 --> 00:50:48,333
然后你就不再愚蠢了

2289
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:54,733
心态平和的人认为 智慧上的谦逊是让人喜爱的 对 真的很让人喜爱

2290
00:50:54,866 --> 00:50:58,533
我想要的一个结果就是 因为他们也总是在提问 他们也总是有冒名顶替综合症

2291
00:50:58,666 --> 00:51:04,866
如果他们有任何感觉 比如你更在乎你知道的还是你不知道的

2292
00:51:04,966 --> 00:51:09,400
嗯 如果你有能力 （那么）你会更多的了解到自己在哪些地方无知

2293
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:13,733
所以你总是在提问 你看到别人在提问 你会想 哦 你在提问

2294
00:51:14,033 --> 00:51:24,433
你可能有能力 所以 这就是一个人将来变得有能力或更有能力的轨迹 对吗 所以我希望

2295
00:51:24,633 --> 00:51:28,366
对于冒名顶替综合症 这是我首先在自己身上注意到的 但随后也在其他人身上看到的

2296
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:36,600
呃 我用一种非正统的方法找到了所谓的冒名顶替适应症 所谓的享乐适应

2297
00:51:36,733 --> 00:51:43,066
是指你的幸福水平在环境改变后倾向于重置的现象

2298
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:47,900
所以你买了一辆新车或得到一座新房子 或得到工作晋升 一开始感觉很好

2299
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,633
但随后它会重置

2300
00:51:49,066 --> 00:51:53,066
冒名顶替综合症意味着你永远不会完全觉得自己配得上生活中的任何成就

2301
00:51:53,266 --> 00:51:55,366
你不觉得自己配在那里

2302
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,700
冒名顶替适应是一种真实的恶性版本

2303
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:04,133
在这种情况下 无论你多少次证明自己的自我怀疑是错误的

2304
00:52:05,066 --> 00:52:07,366
它将继续在现实世界中持续存在

2305
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:12,966
这里有一个真理的核心 因为如果你是开拓者 如果你之前没做过这件事

2306
00:52:13,066 --> 00:52:17,800
但你也要想 我做过多少次类似的事情

2307
00:52:18,033 --> 00:52:21,566
我做过多少次有点像这个但不完全是这个的事情 嗯 人们

2308
00:52:21,766 --> 00:52:29,066
具有高神经质特质的人更有可能感觉到这种方式 因为

2309
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:37,133
神经质是负面情绪性格特质 它是对威胁和惩罚敏感性的一个指标

2310
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:45,633
所以想象一下 很难调整你应该根据每单位威胁展现出多少单位的生理准备状态

2311
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,366
嗯 对 因为威胁有多大 答案是你不知道

2312
00:52:51,466 --> 00:52:54,033
你早上醒来时感到一侧有疼痛

2313
00:52:55,666 --> 00:53:02,366
那是无事还是六个月后会致你死亡的癌症 后者的可能性相当低

2314
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:09,033
但可能性不为零 那为什么你不应该惊慌失措呢 答案是有些人会 而且

2315
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,866
有时候他们是对的

2316
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:18,466
所以尤其是当威胁与新奇性相关时 威胁的校准是一种优点 但也是几乎不可能的计算问题

2317
00:53:18,766 --> 00:53:24,400
我们有大约十种不同的机制尝试解决这个问题 其中一种机制是

2318
00:53:24,433 --> 00:53:30,500
反应存在着巨大的变异性 如果你神经质特质较高 你就会一直有你描述的问题

2319
00:53:30,766 --> 00:53:35,666
你会对你的能力和你位置的有效性感到怀疑 而且

2320
00:53:37,533 --> 00:53:42,866
我们真正知道的唯一治疗方法是自愿地让自己面对你害怕的事物 并且

2321
00:53:43,566 --> 00:53:48,133
通过这样做变得更勇敢 但有些人比其他人更需要与此共存

2322
00:53:49,566 --> 00:53:50,900
我意识到的事情是

2323
00:53:51,733 --> 00:53:55,300
过了一段时间 如果你继续在现实世界中证明你的冒名顶替综合症是错误的

2324
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,766
是的 你面临一个挑战

2325
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:01,666
你坚信你可能不会或可能不会或不应该克服它 然后你做到了

2326
00:54:02,733 --> 00:54:08,833
过了一段时间 你必须承认你的冒名顶替综合症与你的能力无关

2327
00:54:08,866 --> 00:54:11,333
而是与你对冒名顶替的上瘾有关

2328
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:15,133
是的 而且随着人们年龄的增长 这确实会改变

2329
00:54:16,066 --> 00:54:24,766
一般而言 他们变得更加宜人、更有责任心 负面情绪降低 其中一部分是你看到的适应

2330
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:30,866
你通过各种挑战生存下来 然后你可以向自己复审这些证据

2331
00:54:30,966 --> 00:54:35,666
但也是因为你周围的人支持你 因为他们对你有信心

2332
00:54:35,866 --> 00:54:39,866
所以他们的焦虑不会触发你的焦虑 他们会提醒你

2333
00:54:41,133 --> 00:54:45,766
你知道 你能做到 你做过很多次了 你知道 你做过很多次

2334
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:49,133
是的 而且是的 我认为这确实有帮助

2335
00:54:49,433 --> 00:54:54,600
我的意思是 这确实帮助人们随着年龄的增长和经验的积累变得更加自信

2336
00:54:55,033 --> 00:55:00,700
但它受到潜在特征变异性和对负面情绪的敏感性的影响

2337
00:55:00,733 --> 00:55:06,300
我的意思是 对自尊量表和神经质量表进行了良好的心理测量分析

2338
00:55:07,266 --> 00:55:12,000
它们几乎是同一回事 只是反向的

2339
00:55:14,533 --> 00:55:15,933
你对自己有信心吗

2340
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,500
自尊心不足 你缺乏自信

2341
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:24,800
所以对某些人来说确实更难 因为他们需要更多证据来减弱他们对威胁的反应

2342
00:55:25,366 --> 00:55:31,266
所以这部分是因为我们都在某种程度上适应了归纳失败

2343
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,433
对 仅仅因为某件事在过去发生过多次并不意味着

2344
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,600
它下次必然会发生 这是个重要观点

2345
00:55:39,633 --> 00:55:41,100
这是农夫和鸡的问题

2346
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:44,800
对 农夫总是喂鸡 鸡以为农夫是它最好的朋友

2347
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,433
过去有一个稳定的模式 你开始依赖它 但任何时候这一原则都可能被推翻

2348
00:55:49,466 --> 00:56:09,766
因此 我们的神经质特质存在变异性这一事实是归纳失败概率的结果

2349
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:14,700
这是一个非常难解决的问题 如何调节负面情绪 你知道 

2350
00:56:14,733 --> 00:56:25,233
但我想说的是 我们所知道的最好的方法就是不断地主动面对挑战 以适合你的速度集中注意力

2351
00:56:25,533 --> 00:56:32,533
发展你的能力 这实际上可以稳定你周围的环境 所以它实际上更难以预测 也更不具有威胁性 

2352
00:56:32,566 --> 00:56:36,566
再加上你积累了这些证据 并因此获得了社会支持

2353
00:56:36,633 --> 00:56:37,933
这是你前进的最佳路径

2354
00:56:39,366 --> 00:56:42,533
你说过 一个无害的人不是一个好人

2355
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:46,500
一个好人是一个非常危险的人 但他能自愿地将这种危险性控制

2356
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:47,833
人们应该如何变得更危险

2357
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:58,900
噢 变得更善于表达绝对是其中之一 我会说那是主要的武器库

2358
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:06,833
所以 我的意思是 体能素质是一回事 而且不是小事 随之而来的体能自信也是如此

2359
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:13,900
但同样的事情也出现在沟通和思考能力的层面上

2360
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:19,900
这是一个更广阔的战场和机遇

2361
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:24,633
所以这件事没有被很好的教导 尤其是对男孩子来说

2362
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:31,766
我会说 对男孩子来说 教这个更重要 因为他们对整体的教育事业更加持怀疑态度

2363
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:38,966
一般来说 部分原因是他们不那么听话 部分原因是他们不那么随和

2364
00:57:39,866 --> 00:57:41,833
对不随和的男孩子来说尤其如此

2365
00:57:42,833 --> 00:57:48,833
随和的男孩子因为更容易相处 所以不考虑他们的智商和学术成就 他们得到更高的成绩

2366
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,500
那么你对不随和的男孩子说什么呢

2367
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,200
没有什么能比口头表达能力和清晰表达自己更让你变得强大

2368
00:58:00,366 --> 00:58:03,133
能够思考 整理你的论点 对吗

2369
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:14,266
用一些战场隐喻 把一切整理好 让你的信息清晰 整合你的力量

2370
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:20,066
所以 我的意思是 这部分原因是说唱艺术家如此受欢迎

2371
00:58:20,133 --> 00:58:25,966
尤其是在失落的年轻黑人和白人男性中 因为他们难以置信地善于表达 就像

2372
00:58:26,533 --> 00:58:38,133
他们拥有这不可思议的口头才能 这非常有吸引力 你知道 而且它常常与真正的艺术和救赎活动相关

2373
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,933
积极关注某种程度上代表底层声音的东西

2374
00:58:42,933 --> 00:58:43,266
我们可以说

2375
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,566
但这是一个强有力的声音 对吗 而且很有趣的是看到有多少年轻白人男性认同这一点

2376
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,800
是阿道司·赫胥黎写的《感知的门》吗

2377
00:58:53,433 --> 00:58:53,633
是的

2378
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,933
所以这有点类似 对吗

2379
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,933
你有一种很多人都难以表达的经历

2380
00:59:02,466 --> 00:59:07,066
你吸收了我们中最优秀的 拥有最精确、最清晰、最博学的语言 

2381
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,966
你让他们加入进来 然后说 好吧 向我们展示你学到了什么

2382
00:59:11,933 --> 00:59:16,433
这是相似的 但针对的是不同的社区 一种可能的不同生活方式

2383
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:23,133
你可能无法描述住在曼彻斯特的社会住房或者

2384
00:59:23,633 --> 00:59:26,366
布鲁克林的某个街区或其他地方的感觉

2385
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,200
但这个人能做到 感觉就像是你的声音（说出了你的心声）

2386
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:30,366
是的

2387
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:36,133
如果你是一个年轻人 你仍然会感到自己被排斥在外 无法继承自己应得的王国 

2388
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,766
我的意思是 这对每个人来说都是一个存在的真理 特别是对每个年轻人

2389
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,366
因为在很多方面他都是一个局外人 他年轻且幼稚 并不被高度重视

2390
00:59:46,433 --> 00:59:54,100
然后在某种意义上因为当前国王的不足——当前文化的不足而受到伤害

2391
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:58,066
并且因为这一点很容易就会被煽动反对它

2392
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:02,433
这就是邪恶叔叔的阴谋 那是亚瑟王的故事

2393
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:06,800
那是荷鲁斯和奥西里斯的故事 这是一个古老的故事

2394
01:00:07,533 --> 01:00:09,066
那是索伦的故事

2395
01:00:11,766 --> 01:00:13,200
它一直存在

2396
01:00:14,233 --> 01:00:16,966
你在说唱音乐和嘻哈音乐中看到这一点

2397
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:27,333
所有那些疏离感被以一种艺术的方式赋予了清晰的声音 这是口头能力力量的一个好例子

2398
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:31,566
这是向年轻人推广教育的途径

2399
01:00:31,566 --> 01:00:35,966
就像你想要取得你在王国中合法的位置吗

2400
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,600
就像是整理你的言辞吧 伙计

2401
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:47,400
以最高的意义上控制它 我和Tammy去了纽约的喜剧地窖俱乐部

2402
01:00:47,433 --> 01:00:52,900
这是一个很棒的喜剧俱乐部 最后一个喜剧演员是一个英国人

2403
01:00:54,033 --> 01:00:59,900
他在外貌上并不特别吸引人 他开了很多关于这点的玩笑 相当有趣

2404
01:01:00,633 --> 01:01:07,266
然后他把观众分成五个部分 要求每个部分随机提一个话题

2405
01:01:07,966 --> 01:01:13,633
话题非常随机 比如肯尼迪暗杀和1890年之前的电灯

2406
01:01:13,666 --> 01:01:17,300
这是其中的两个话题 其他三个同样多样

2407
01:01:18,166 --> 01:01:26,566
然后他放了一些节拍 进行了大约八分钟的说唱 每一节都押韵

2408
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:27,766
并且

2409
01:01:28,366 --> 01:01:33,800
他在最后将整个表演串联起来 随着音乐结束自然结束

2410
01:01:34,633 --> 01:01:37,533
这简直令人难以置信 那就是逻各斯（Logos） 伙计

2411
01:01:37,533 --> 01:01:41,733
那就是逻各斯的救赎力量 就在那里 魔法词 神圣词

2412
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,266
它就这样在舞台上显现

2413
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:56,533
那有一种非常令人印象深刻的东西 也感觉很危险--不是我需要担心、应该被隔离和封锁的那种--而是你会觉得那个人有太多的能力

2414
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:01,366
它从他们身上流露出来 你几乎觉得自己仅仅通过与他们相处就变得有能力了

2415
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:08,666
你通过欣赏它肯定会感到有能力 因为它讲述了你那能够欣赏这些事物的一部分

2416
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:13,233
你会想 哇 这真是了不起 这是一场惊人的展示 看到这真是太棒了

2417
01:02:13,933 --> 01:02:14,366
惊人 对吗

2418
01:02:15,133 --> 01:02:16,666
“惊人”这个词非常有趣

2419
01:02:18,033 --> 01:02:20,700
你被那种魅力所困 被那种魅力所吸引

2420
01:02:21,366 --> 01:02:26,600
那种魅力 不是小事 它是某种救赎正在发生的信号

2421
01:02:27,266 --> 01:02:34,400
这几乎解释了嘻哈和说唱音乐的全部吸引力

2422
01:02:35,166 --> 01:02:42,333
它是挣扎但有价值的下层阶级的清晰的声音 我想这是一个很好的表达方式 

2423
01:02:43,133 --> 01:02:45,933
但那些被剥夺了他们合法位置的人

2424
01:02:47,066 --> 01:02:52,533
这种言辞才能是他们向光亮奋斗的方式之一

2425
01:02:53,700 --> 01:03:00,233
这是一个很好的例子 说明控制了那种危险 因为以很多方式来说 它是一个黑暗的流派 对吗

2426
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:07,900
有一股真正的暗流 一种暴力的气氛围绕着它及其文化

2427
01:03:08,533 --> 01:03:12,566
就像70年代末英国的朋克运动一样 同样的事情

2428
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:23,933
但以一种诗意的、引人入胜的方式表达这种能力 约翰尼·罗顿在这方面很擅长

2429
01:03:24,566 --> 01:03:25,466
他非常激烈

2430
01:03:26,566 --> 01:03:30,133
后来他在 PIL Public Image Limited 工作 

2431
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:30,566
是这样吗

2432
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,200
公共形象

2433
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:32,866
我认为是的

2434
01:03:33,233 --> 01:03:40,300
他有一首叫做《Rise》的歌 当我开始给来访者进行自信训练时 我总是给他们听这首歌

2435
01:03:40,433 --> 01:03:47,966
我会放约翰尼·罗顿的《Rise》 歌词中有一句是“愤怒是一种能量” 他有一双难以置信的激烈眼神

2436
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:48,866
愤怒是一种能量

2437
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:49,600
你打赌

2438
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:53,100
约翰·莱登 伙计 他能像几乎没人能做到的那样引导这种能量

2439
01:03:53,600 --> 01:04:00,666
他让那种愤怒在自己内部积累 然后完全控制住了 通过音乐表达出来 他绝对迷人

2440
01:04:01,866 --> 01:04:02,600
难以置信的魅力

2441
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:08,900
我真的很喜欢他的音乐 那种原始的愤怒在音乐中 但它是在音乐中 不是吗

2442
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:17,633
不是某种随机的暴动 你知道 他将那种转变成了某种东西

2443
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:27,033
你可以就朋克摇滚的诗歌价值争论 尽管我认为你不应该 我是说 西德·维休斯的《我做事我的方式》我的天哪

2444
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,766
那是天才之作 它是如此精彩的讽刺

2445
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:35,633
有人在做的是他们正在精炼它 将其蒸馏并引导它

2446
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,166
所以几年前我去了一场举重比赛

2447
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:47,800
那里有个人在举重 他在深蹲上保持着一堆纪录 他是一个来自纽卡斯尔郊区一个普通工人阶级城镇的普通工人阶级人士

2448
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:52,133
观看那个人热身真是别有一番风味

2449
01:04:52,433 --> 01:04:54,400
他有一份神圣的播放列表

2450
01:04:54,866 --> 01:04:58,766
他从不在举重台上准备时之外听这些歌曲

2451
01:04:59,633 --> 01:05:03,133
他戴着耳机 来回走动 就像你会看到一头准备好了的公牛

2452
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:08,166
即将准备冲出去追逐某物一样 然后他走上舞台

2453
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:12,966
你看着他 你的脖子后面的毛发都会竖起来

2454
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:19,233
这个人在引导愤怒和狂怒 那是战神 是玛尔斯 是的

2455
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:23,900
他与之连接 嗯 难以置信 而且 伙计 你用言语去战斗

2456
01:05:25,066 --> 01:05:32,733
你会认为这就是年轻人应该被教导的 我们继续 但愤怒 嗯 我想谈谈你的康复

2457
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:40,666
你能解释一下最初几天 当你意识到这可能结束了 云层正在散去时 你的感受吗

2458
01:05:41,366 --> 01:05:44,866
你知道 这发生得非常缓慢 持续了几个月

2459
01:05:46,266 --> 01:05:50,300
嗯 早上的情况稍微不那么灾难性

2460
01:05:50,333 --> 01:05:59,800
我需要三个半小时才能站起来 只需要大约三小时

2461
01:06:01,566 --> 01:06:04,566
所以这看起来像是可能有所改善

2462
01:06:04,566 --> 01:06:05,900
这个过程非常缓慢

2463
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:07,966
就像是关于你何时变老的问题

2464
01:06:08,566 --> 01:06:09,833
是的 没错

2465
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:10,566
一天一天来

2466
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,800
确实如此

2467
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:15,466
所以 你知道 我仍然有很多痛苦

2468
01:06:15,466 --> 01:06:17,333
我大多时候感觉像是一直在患严重的流感 但那比以前要好多了

2469
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:20,566
所以

2470
01:06:24,133 --> 01:06:25,733
那边有什么改变了呢

2471
01:06:25,766 --> 01:06:29,933
你是否以不同的方式看待你应该如何存在于这个世界上

2472
01:06:29,933 --> 01:06:32,800
在长期生病之后 你是否感觉自己有了新的目标

2473
01:06:39,366 --> 01:06:47,700
希望的是 我更感激没有灾难

2474
01:06:49,233 --> 01:06:56,033
我猜 也许更高兴的是出去做巡回演讲 我很高兴在2018年做得这一点

2475
01:06:56,066 --> 01:07:03,133
我已经非常开心了 开心不是恰当的词 是被压倒了 感激

2476
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:10,533
人们处于持续的不敢相信的状态 对人们的积极反应感到兴奋

2477
01:07:10,633 --> 01:07:17,866
对这有像宗教维度那样的事实感到惊奇

2478
01:07:18,033 --> 01:07:23,033
对看到人们来告诉我 他们已经让自己的生活变得更好 并对此感到非常高兴的事实而感到欣喜

2479
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,700
我已经有了这一切 也许我现在感觉更强烈了

2480
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:39,566
现在 我不会说我已经学到了那么多 以至于所有的痛苦都是值得的

2481
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:48,433
但这 我想 在某种意义上 这是以一种太过俗套的方式来给某事放上了一个快乐的结局

2482
01:07:48,633 --> 01:07:57,600
就像 大多数时间我宁愿死掉 出于各种各样的原因

2483
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:01,066
所以现在我非常高兴我没有

2484
01:08:02,866 --> 01:08:10,066
我没忘记那是什么感觉 有很多人很高兴你没有

2485
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,333
是的 嗯 那真的很好

2486
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:13,633
真的很好

2487
01:08:13,666 --> 01:08:14,266
那真的很好

2488
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:22,100
你知道 我为能够不让我的家人感到恐惧而感到兴奋 比如说

2489
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:25,700
我真的很高兴能再次回到公众视野

2490
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,733
做我们正在做的事

2491
01:08:28,166 --> 01:08:33,700
你知道 与我的女儿、我的妻子一起 得到我的家人的支持

2492
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:34,000
这很棒

2493
01:08:34,966 --> 01:08:36,266
我喜欢这次巡演

2494
01:08:36,266 --> 01:08:39,233
遇见这么多如此积极的人真好

2495
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:44,433
这是难以置信的积极 在一个如此多负面和荒谬负面的世界里

2496
01:08:46,566 --> 01:08:53,666
这是一件可爱的事情 看到这些 我将在美国见到十五万人 你知道 从...

2497
01:08:54,733 --> 01:08:59,400
巡演大约两周前开始的 我认为是四月底

2498
01:09:00,533 --> 01:09:05,433
在我们前往加拿大、然后到英国、欧洲、澳大利亚和新西兰、东南亚和俄罗斯之前

2499
01:09:05,866 --> 01:09:08,400
所有这些都在计划中

2500
01:09:09,566 --> 01:09:17,400
见到15万愿意尝试让他们的生活变得更好而来听讲座的人

2501
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:26,400
尽管它们本质上是哲学论文 或至少是我一个小时内能做到的最好的

2502
01:09:27,566 --> 01:09:30,366
看到人们对此的投入并听到他们的故事

2503
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:30,966
这是

2504
01:09:33,533 --> 01:09:38,800
你无法想象还有什么能比这更积极 所以如果有东西可以回归

2505
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:44,266
在拥有这一切之后 你几乎找不到更好的世界了

2506
01:09:44,966 --> 01:09:50,600
不 我的意思是 这其中的负面情况是 这样的需求如此之大

2507
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:56,233
你知道 因为我认为我能提供的一部分可能是鼓励 因为

2508
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:00,000
我不认为地球上的人更少会更好

2509
01:10:00,766 --> 01:10:07,866
我也不认为年轻人的雄心壮志只不过是腐败权力意志的体现等等

2510
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:17,266
事实上 很多人在一定程度上因为这样的指控而感到虚无主义地消沉 因为他们被自己的良心击倒

2511
01:10:17,433 --> 01:10:21,366
我认为这绝对令人震惊

2512
01:10:22,533 --> 01:10:24,066
看到人们对我所做的事情的积极态度 背后有这样的阴影

2513
01:10:24,233 --> 01:10:31,200
那就是 这种需求是不是太可怕了

2514
01:10:31,433 --> 01:10:34,933
但根据所有迹象 这是必要的 至少对于似乎在听我的人来说是这样

2515
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:42,300
所以这就是生活 你知道 我确实相信 我认为我的家人坚定地支持我这一信念

2516
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:49,566
你知道这个想法 地球上有太多人了 这是一种集体想法

2517
01:10:50,866 --> 01:10:51,266
你知道这个

2518
01:10:54,966 --> 01:10:58,733
认为有太多人就像是认为人群太大了

2519
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:04,400
人太多了

2520
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,366
人群太庞大了 但我不把人们视为一个整体

2521
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,133
我把人看作个体

2522
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:16,366
所以不存在一个庞大的人群

2523
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:22,633
这是错误的分析层面 就我而言 正确的分析层面是每个个体

2524
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:27,533
我认为这是

2525
01:11:30,066 --> 01:11:34,733
西方文明的核心信条 至少在西方真正文明的程度上

2526
01:11:35,266 --> 01:11:39,333
可以说 越是文明 就越强调个体

2527
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:40,300
而且

2528
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:49,233
个体是主权者的观念是西方文明的核心公理 也是民主本身

2529
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:54,966
我相信这个陈述像我们共同形成的任何陈述一样真实

2530
01:11:55,033 --> 01:11:58,600
所以如果它是真的

2531
01:11:58,733 --> 01:12:04,633
那么真正的战斗发生在个体层面 甚至是个体内部

2532
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:06,633
对我来说这很好

2533
01:12:06,733 --> 01:12:15,300
所以我主要是试图与个体建立联系 即使我在对成千上万的人讲话

2534
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,766
我从不把他们当作一个群体讲话

2535
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,100
我从不把他们看作一个群体

2536
01:12:20,133 --> 01:12:26,500
当我在对我的观众讲话时 我从不看向人群 我总是看着某一个人 你知道

2537
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:29,100
不总是同一个人 因为这会让他们感到不舒服

2538
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:33,666
他们很高兴被单独点出来一两秒 但如果是一分钟就会变得奇怪

2539
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:39,500
是的 所以我总是看着某个人 但我总是在和一个人讲话

2540
01:12:39,533 --> 01:12:42,533
我部分从克尔凯郭尔那里学到了这一点 你知道

2541
01:12:43,933 --> 01:12:48,066
克尔凯郭尔坚信 一旦真理被群体所体现

2542
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,233
它就不再是真理

2543
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:53,933
真理本质上总是在个体层面显现

2544
01:12:54,633 --> 01:12:59,533
人们注意到他们在自己的生活中知道这一点 你拥有自己的智慧 进入一个群体你就会妥协这种智慧

2545
01:12:59,766 --> 01:13:03,733
出于某种原因 比如社会规范或你处理过去创伤的方式或是

2546
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:08,233
你认为人们想从你这里听到的东西 你知道 这是责任的分散

2547
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:19,066
是的 因为当你被埋在暴徒中时 你可以做、说一些暴民在世界上会替你隐瞒的事情

2548
01:13:19,433 --> 01:13:24,500
而如果你只是靠自己行动 你的行为后果会很快显现

2549
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:30,200
无处可藏 所以我们必须知道 每个人群都不是暴民

2550
01:13:30,233 --> 01:13:41,200
我的意思是 有的人群是去中心化的、高度功能的集合 由个体组成的层级 这在每个分析层面都在起作用

2551
01:13:41,966 --> 01:13:43,633
这是一个正常运作的社会

2552
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:45,800
那个时候就不是暴民了

2553
01:13:46,433 --> 01:13:54,533
整个层级中存在一种动态 使得个体

2554
01:13:54,600 --> 01:14:01,166
比如说在层级底部的人 与层级顶部的少数人完全保持联系

2555
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:11,966
一个运作良好的民主政治国家就有这种特性 就是上下有恒常的沟通 就像大脑的组织方式一样

2556
01:14:12,033 --> 01:14:19,066
大脑是一个层级结构 但信息不仅仅是从底部向上或从顶部向下传播 甚至是你的视觉系统

2557
01:14:19,266 --> 01:14:24,833
例如 当信息首次从你的眼睛进入你的大脑时 在黄斑水平上

2558
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:33,766
每个黄斑 即你视野中心的高分辨率部分 每个细胞在视觉处理的第一层由10,000个细胞代表

2559
01:14:34,633 --> 01:14:37,900
因此 从你的眼睛到你的大脑有大量的输入 从下到上

2560
01:14:38,633 --> 01:14:43,100
但即使在视觉感知的最底层 也有更多来自你大脑的自上而下的连接

2561
01:14:44,066 --> 01:14:50,300
所以视觉系统是层级化的 但层级中的每一层都沿着层级通信

2562
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,866
一个好的政治系统也是这样构建的

2563
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,633
所以你可以有一个不是暴民的人群

2564
01:14:57,133 --> 01:15:03,600
这是一种不同的组织 一个民主政体不是暴民 至少如果它正常运作的话不是

2565
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:07,300
你知道 这是我去英格兰时真正体会到的

2566
01:15:07,433 --> 01:15:13,933
我走进了国会大厦的大厅 那是一个巨大的穹顶建筑 大致位于议会十字架的中心

2567
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:22,766
那是大不列颠的公民可以来与他们的代表见面讨论的地方

2568
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,166
所以那是人民的声音遇见代表的声音的地方

2569
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,466
从某种意义上说 这就是它应该如何工作的

2570
01:15:29,466 --> 01:15:37,266
在层级的底部 以一种难以言表的方式激动着的情绪和担忧

2571
01:15:38,566 --> 01:15:44,366
问题首先在哪里显现 因为它们总是首先在层级的底部显现

2572
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:50,033
这些问题不一定容易表达 所以人们带着他们的担忧跌跌撞撞地前进

2573
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:56,266
他们的代表的工作是将这些蹒跚的担忧汇集起来

2574
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:04,333
并赋予它们声音 将它们传达给权力结构 将法律转变为新的法律体系

2575
01:16:04,733 --> 01:16:13,133
这就是我们所实践的 以协调底层与顶层 这必须不断发生 因为这就像一个活生生的有机体

2576
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,866
嗯 从某种意义上说 它确实是

2577
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:19,466
它是一个活生生的有机体 因为它是由活生生的有机体组成的超级有机体

2578
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,533
所以 出于所有的目的和意图 它是活着的

2579
01:16:22,566 --> 01:16:26,266
我在大厅里 这一点真的很打动我

2580
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:29,766
顺便说一下 这就是“游说”这个词的来源 所以它就发生在那里

2581
01:16:29,766 --> 01:16:29,966
嗯嗯

2582
01:16:30,233 --> 01:16:33,466
嗯嗯 人们对游说持有怀疑态度 但是

2583
01:16:35,233 --> 01:16:37,966
人们对很多事情都持有怀疑态度 这并没有太大帮助

2584
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,666
是否有可能承担过多的责任 为自己承担过多的责任

2585
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,866
我一直在思考的一点是

2586
01:16:46,866 --> 01:16:53,766
受害者心态 你相信自己对生活中的结果没有任何控制权

2587
01:16:53,866 --> 01:17:02,433
我想知道是否存在相反的情况 你相信自己对它们拥有无限的控制权 并且你对自己的天赋能力失去了信心 只是让自己随波逐流

2588
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:13,833
我一直在思考放开舵柄的事情 这是杰德·麦肯纳的一句话 他谈到最好的驾驶船只穿越风暴的方式实际上是

2589
01:17:13,966 --> 01:17:18,600
放开舵柄 这样船只可以最好地在波涛中航行

2590
01:17:19,233 --> 01:17:30,166
我认为很多时候 回到我们之前讨论的冒名顶替综合征 随着你开始积累越来越多的能力

2591
01:17:30,233 --> 01:17:38,100
更高层次的过度思考 更高层次的神经质 更多对细节的关注 这些让你从0到50 不一定能让你从50到100

2592
01:17:39,633 --> 01:17:41,900
你必须渡过一条河 那是困难和艰苦的

2593
01:17:42,466 --> 01:17:45,466
你不需要把那艘船背过陆地再用它渡过下一条河

2594
01:17:46,233 --> 01:17:55,900
我想知道是否存在受害者心态的反面 你为生活中发生的事情承担责任 我想知道你是否可以超越这个

2595
01:17:56,033 --> 01:17:56,666
你当然可以

2596
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:57,866
是的 绝对可以

2597
01:17:58,633 --> 01:18:03,900
我的意思是 你知道 陀思妥耶夫斯基说每个人都对他做的每件事负责

2598
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:16,566
以及对其他每个人做的每件事负责 这在某种意义上是一种疯狂的声明 但也在某种程度上是真实的

2599
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,833
你确实拥有无限的责任 你确实有无限的能力承担那责任

2600
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:24,066
但这并不意味着它不会压垮你

2601
01:18:24,066 --> 01:18:31,766
然后我会说 对此的解药是 你并不是孤身一人

2602
01:18:31,766 --> 01:18:39,266
随着你的责任增加 你的机会增多 你必须要委派越来越多的任务

2603
01:18:40,366 --> 01:18:46,800
每个人都有足够的工作要做 重要的是你尽你所能 但每个人都有工作要做

2604
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,200
所以你可能会说

2605
01:18:50,133 --> 01:18:56,666
英雄之路是通往普遍救赎的道路 这是真的 你可能会说 这都是你的责任 从某种意义上说 是的 但是

2606
01:18:57,766 --> 01:19:00,766
你刚刚描述的问题就是承担了太多的负担

2607
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:05,666
它可以压垮你 可能是不可持续的 你会因为做得不够好而折磨自己

2608
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:08,866
这确实是你的责任 但不仅仅是你一个人的责任

2609
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:10,966
不仅仅是你一个人的责任

2610
01:19:12,433 --> 01:19:16,766
所以你需要委派任务 你需要帮助你周围的人成长

2611
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:20,666
这样他们都朝着同一个方向努力

2612
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:21,133
这是一种努力

2613
01:19:21,433 --> 01:19:27,400
这是一种努力的倍增器 无论如何 你确保他们得到认可

2614
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:31,133
他们得到的认可就足够好了

2615
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:32,300
这并不完全正确

2616
01:19:33,533 --> 01:19:40,466
奖励应该与他们的努力相符 你可以分配这一点 你知道的

2617
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,233
因为伴随而来的还可能有自恋 那就是

2618
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:49,500
一切都取决于我 即使你以非常有能力的方式工作 也可能会这样感觉

2619
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:55,033
但是有足够的工作要做 也有足够的地方应该给予认可

2620
01:19:55,233 --> 01:20:02,100
所以当你获得更多责任和机会时 你就会分配更多的任务 并且持续这样做

2621
01:20:02,133 --> 01:20:08,133
我的意思是 一名优秀管理者的角色之一就是让自己变得无关紧要 变得过时

2622
01:20:08,133 --> 01:20:08,633
是的 对

2623
01:20:08,666 --> 01:20:12,133
所以如果你不是一个好的经理 如果你的公司会因为你的缺位而崩溃

2624
01:20:13,833 --> 01:20:16,766
那你应该全部被委派出去 这不是因为你在放弃责任

2625
01:20:17,533 --> 01:20:22,566
因为如果你能将某事规范化并分配给其他人

2626
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:27,100
所以这里有一个小王国给你 它不一定要小 它是可以成长的

2627
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,733
但这里有一个王国给你

2628
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:33,966
那么你就可以去做下一件你需要做的非常重要的事情

2629
01:20:34,466 --> 01:20:37,833
你知道 你可能会认为有一个王国 然后它被分成小王国

2630
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:43,433
所以你在层级中越低 你得到的王国就越小 但这只有在你认为世界是零和游戏的情况下才成立

2631
01:20:43,533 --> 01:20:51,366
因为你也可以把它想象成一个不定的地方 一个有不定数量的最大的地方

2632
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:57,733
我认为为什么我们认为 在某种意义上我们正在做的事情会枯竭

2633
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:02,666
它看起来不会枯竭 这就是成长心态的极限 就像

2634
01:21:03,633 --> 01:21:07,100
经济学家不相信那个 因为他们认为我们可以变得更加高效

2635
01:21:07,233 --> 01:21:11,466
我们确实变得比以前更高效了 并且

2636
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:16,766
那些效率提升 当它们没有被干扰时 以超过算术比例的速度增加

2637
01:21:16,866 --> 01:21:26,766
为什么你认为人们倾向于零和心态 当我发现自己这样想的时候

2638
01:21:26,833 --> 01:21:31,533
这是我首先自我检查的事情之一 我认为这是癌症

2639
01:21:33,066 --> 01:21:37,033
是的 我的意思是 生活中确实有一些元素具有零和属性

2640
01:21:37,133 --> 01:21:41,333
我的意思是 如果你和另一个男人竞争 比如为了和一个特定的女人结婚

2641
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:47,666
那是一个零和游戏 如果你只把游戏想象为包括你们两个和那个女人

2642
01:21:48,233 --> 01:21:51,433
所以你可以设定零和的情况

2643
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:55,466
但我认为这种情况不适用于不是零和的情形 是的

2644
01:21:55,700 --> 01:22:02,100
然后 但如果拿零和游戏的隐喻来说 哪里必须有赢家和输家 因为资源数量有限

2645
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:08,100
这就假设了那游戏的规则适用于所有游戏

2646
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:10,466
这其实不是真的

2647
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:17,200
游戏是无限可扩展的 我的意思是你可以发明新的游戏 人们一直在这么做 《卡坦岛》的发明者

2648
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:23,000
这是一个我非常喜欢玩的游戏 是一个非常受欢迎的桌面游戏 直到他发明它之前它都不存在

2649
01:22:23,433 --> 01:22:26,633
你知道 成千上万的人玩它 他因此赚了一大笔钱

2650
01:22:26,666 --> 01:22:28,066
那个游戏之前从未存在过

2651
01:22:28,066 --> 01:22:36,933
所以我们似乎没有发明游戏数量的限制 这是一个复杂的问题 因为

2652
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:44,933
我们生活在一个单一的星球上 有些资源比其他资源更倾向于零和

2653
01:22:44,966 --> 01:22:54,433
但我们实际上还没有真正遇到任何实际的零和限制 就我们在这个星球上过上富足生活的可能性而言

2654
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:58,266
我们对某些资源的管理非常愚蠢

2655
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:03,700
比如 我们在管理海洋产出方面做得非常糟糕

2656
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:13,966
虽然鱼类养殖在生产方面在一定程度上缓解了这个问题 但这是一个我们可以并且应该解决的公地悲剧问题 就我而言

2657
01:23:13,966 --> 01:23:14,900
就我而言

2658
01:23:14,966 --> 01:23:19,600
我认为特鲁多政府做的一件好事 公平地说

2659
01:23:19,833 --> 01:23:25,866
就是将加拿大的很多海岸划入海洋保护区

2660
01:23:26,466 --> 01:23:27,033
这很明智

2661
01:23:27,633 --> 01:23:30,466
我们必须明智地利用我们的资源 但这并不意味着是零和的

2662
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,233
当然也不意味着世界是一个零和游戏

2663
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:40,966
这是一个马尔萨斯主义的想法 你知道 人口会增长直到消耗所有可用资源然后骤然崩溃

2664
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,800
然后为什么我们会有末日思维呢

2665
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,833
因为事物确实会突然结束

2666
01:23:46,733 --> 01:23:53,800
人们会死亡 人们会得到致命疾病 就像你仔细构建的世界随时都可能因为一个随机事件而被摧毁

2667
01:23:54,633 --> 01:24:01,600
比如基因突变导致的癌症将你夺命 生命本质上有一个末日般的方面

2668
01:24:02,666 --> 01:24:11,400
我们确实理解这一点 因为我们有自我意识 然后将这种末日推理应用于事物本身是非常困难的

2669
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,100
世界将会燃烧殆尽 气候变得过热

2670
01:24:15,566 --> 01:24:19,333
关于失控的正反馈循环怎么办 因为这就是气候学家所担心的

2671
01:24:19,366 --> 01:24:20,700
就像嘿 它们确实会发生

2672
01:24:21,833 --> 01:24:23,833
我们如何限制我们的末日思维

2673
01:24:25,033 --> 01:24:26,666
这是个好问题 伙计

2674
01:24:28,033 --> 01:24:29,233
这是个好问题

2675
01:24:29,233 --> 01:24:30,733
我们通过真理做到这一点

2676
01:24:30,766 --> 01:24:31,600
我们通过真理做到这一点

2677
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:38,800
我们通过对话、调查、探索、纪律等方式做到这一点

2678
01:24:38,833 --> 01:24:41,633
逻各斯是对抗末日的解药

2679
01:24:41,633 --> 01:24:45,100
当然 这是基督教教义的核心 不是吗

2680
01:24:45,133 --> 01:24:49,700
逻各斯是对抗末日的解药

2681
01:24:49,733 --> 01:24:51,600
我很欣赏这个观点

2682
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,000
那这意味着什么

2683
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,466
爱和真理是对抗末日的解药

2684
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:58,466
不是地球上的人太多了

2685
01:25:01,433 --> 01:25:07,200
你几个月前我们一起出去吃饭时对我说 我问你我应该怎么做我的生活 你说你现在正在做的 我觉得相当不错 然后你说

2686
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:14,433
用真理服务于爱

2687
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,166
真理服务于爱

2688
01:25:18,166 --> 01:25:19,066
嗯嗯

2689
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:20,100
这是什么意思

2690
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:20,600
他又提到了这个

2691
01:25:24,366 --> 01:25:26,466
这是一种美德的层次

2692
01:25:26,466 --> 01:25:31,200
我会说 你知道 有一个古老的观念认为上帝是所有善的总和

2693
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:35,266
我不认为“总和”是完全正确的隐喻

2694
01:25:36,233 --> 01:25:37,600
这更像是想象一下

2695
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,666
有永恒的真理 美 正义 爱

2696
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:49,733
爱 勇气 坚韧 同情 将所有这些东西视为美德

2697
01:25:51,233 --> 01:25:53,533
所以美德就是所有美德的共性

2698
01:25:53,966 --> 01:25:55,633
美德是所有美德的共性

2699
01:25:56,666 --> 01:25:58,466
这就是上帝与善的关系

2700
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,666
上帝是善的本质

2701
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:05,266
所以让我暂时把这个放在一边

2702
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:09,766
你可能会想 这将如何在你的生活中体现呢

2703
01:26:09,833 --> 01:26:15,033
这可能意味着追求善 这是一种将所有相近的善统一起来的追求

2704
01:26:18,766 --> 01:26:21,833
那究竟是什么呢 它类似于

2705
01:26:23,566 --> 01:26:28,300
相信让所有事物都尽可能地茁壮成长是最好的

2706
01:26:29,166 --> 01:26:34,833
当我还是临床医生时 我认为这是我内在的善服务于我的客户中最好的部分

2707
01:26:36,166 --> 01:26:38,300
我认为希望这种事情发生的愿望

2708
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:38,666
那就是爱

2709
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:58,566
所以那是一种愿望 你想说 拿一个人来说 弯曲的、破碎的、痛苦的、恶毒的、受伤的、腐败的、软弱的、可悲的、可鄙的、令人沮丧的、令人失望的 所有这些我们可以因为我们的不足而强加给自己的东西

2710
01:26:58,733 --> 01:27:04,900
很容易忽视这一点 而这种忽视部分上驱动了这种观念

2711
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:09,533
认为地球上的人太多 我们是地球表面的癌症

2712
01:27:10,933 --> 01:27:15,266
去爱这种状态并不容易 但你想要什么

2713
01:27:15,666 --> 01:27:27,566
你想要破碎的人从他们的破碎中站起来 而不是因此而鄙视他们 然后你将自己定位于此 试图从人们和你自己身上挖掘出这一点

2714
01:27:30,233 --> 01:27:31,500
你必须有那样的框架

2715
01:27:32,566 --> 01:27:36,266
首先那是你的目标 也许那会是地狱的反面

2716
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:40,066
这是一点 尽管我们在细节上有所不同 但我认为这将萨姆·哈里斯和我联结起来

2717
01:27:40,966 --> 01:27:47,166
在某种意义上的信念层面 萨姆非常清楚地意识到恶意和地狱的现实

2718
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,533
他可能不会用形而上学或宗教的方式来构建这个观点 但这并不真正重要

2719
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:59,100
他正在尽最大努力尽可能远离那个方向 直到我上次和他交谈时 我才意识到

2720
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:07,533
萨姆将宗教传统、教条式的宗教传统与产生暴行的极权主义相提并论

2721
01:28:07,666 --> 01:28:18,133
我认为这是一种错误的认同 就像马克思主义者将不平等归咎于资本主义一样 不平等确实是一个问题 但这并非资本主义的过错

2722
01:28:18,633 --> 01:28:24,300
极权主义的暴行确实是一个问题 但将其与宗教条件反射地等同起来

2723
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:33,700
甚至与宗教教条等同起来 那是一个错误 教条 可能吧 但即便如此也是棘手的 因为教条与知识之间的区别是什么

2724
01:28:34,533 --> 01:28:40,600
你知道 今天的知识是明天的教条 区分这两者极其困难

2725
01:28:40,633 --> 01:28:43,766
你不能仅仅放弃你认为的一切 即使它是任意的

2726
01:28:45,833 --> 01:28:56,700
你需要它来指引你 它可以转变为极权教条 并在其不再有效的维护中促成暴行

2727
01:28:57,566 --> 01:28:59,933
但这是一个非常复杂的问题

2728
01:29:01,233 --> 01:29:05,966
所以 如果那是爱 用真理服务于爱

2729
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:10,733
首先是真理

2730
01:29:11,833 --> 01:29:13,166
好吧

2731
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,233
我们可以稍微拆解一下

2732
01:29:17,833 --> 01:29:20,300
你谈到了让船的舵自由的问题

2733
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:22,800
好的

2734
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:25,033
想象你是这样对待

2735
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,100
所以我们正在进行这次对话

2736
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:33,933
比方说 我希望这次对话能以尽可能最好的方式进行

2737
01:29:35,133 --> 01:29:35,433
好的

2738
01:29:35,433 --> 01:29:39,033
嗯 我不知道那是什么方式 但我首先要有这个愿望

2739
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:41,466
所以我来参与对话

2740
01:29:41,466 --> 01:29:50,766
我想我会尽力进行最吸引人的对话 在对话过程中我会说出我认为的情况

2741
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:57,700
我想从你那里得到一些东西 除了希望我们能在那次活动中见面 并试图得到糟糕的结果

2742
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:05,200
我不知道我们要讨论什么 你知道 我们讨论了一些可能的广泛主题 尽管我认为我们没有触及我们实际讨论的任何事情

2743
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:10,633
这并不意味着我们不需要做准备 你知道 然后你会想 

2744
01:30:10,666 --> 01:30:21,966
好吧 无论我们在真正的对话过程中取得什么成就 都是最好的 那就是放弃耕耘者的束缚 

2745
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:28,833
事实确实如此 因为你无法创造结果 所以你通过进行诚实的对话所做的是

2746
01:30:29,866 --> 01:30:35,200
让风吹去它该去的地方 如果你在某个基本层面做出了决定 你就可以这么做

2747
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:46,700
即使你不知道你已经做出了决定 真理将使你自由 而真理归根结底就是救赎 我们倾向于认为真理...

2748
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:50,066
我们倾向于认为真理存在于一组准确的事实中

2749
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:52,133
这实际上是弱点

2750
01:30:52,166 --> 01:30:57,133
我会说这是物质主义无神论立场的弱点 那就是

2751
01:30:59,133 --> 01:31:02,233
关于真理本质的公理性假设 但真理是一个过程

2752
01:31:03,433 --> 01:31:06,566
它是一个过程 通常是一个对话过程

2753
01:31:07,466 --> 01:31:11,233
所以真理是在寻求真理的过程中浮现的东西

2754
01:31:11,233 --> 01:31:11,933
它有点像那样

2755
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:16,033
真正的真理在寻求真理的过程中被发现

2756
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,800
这是一个不断使事物复兴的过程

2757
01:31:20,733 --> 01:31:24,166
那么 如果你的取向是向善的 

2758
01:31:26,333 --> 01:31:28,466
那么你的取向是向善的 

2759
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,733
并且你相信善能够获胜 

2760
01:31:31,933 --> 01:31:35,233
这就是一个信仰 对吗 

2761
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:36,366
善能够获胜

2762
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:37,966
那你的证据是什么呢

2763
01:31:39,933 --> 01:31:44,200
对于你想持有的任何立场 都有证据（去证明那个立场） 所以这是一个决定

2764
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:50,400
你放手 真理将带领你前行 你认为它会走向它应该去的地方

2765
01:31:51,166 --> 01:31:53,233
你致力于这个想法

2766
01:31:54,233 --> 01:31:55,266
然后那就是你的冒险

2767
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,233
这就是其中之一的酷事

2768
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,066
你需要这种冒险来支撑你去对抗悲剧

2769
01:32:02,333 --> 01:32:03,966
没有什么比真理更具冒险性的了

2770
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:07,366
实际上 这是唯一的真正冒险 显然

2771
01:32:08,233 --> 01:32:15,566
你只需仔细思考这个问题20分钟

2772
01:32:16,366 --> 01:32:18,333
如果它不是真的 怎么可能是真正的冒险呢

2773
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:21,833
然后 如果它是真的 为什么它是一次冒险呢

2774
01:32:22,333 --> 01:32:23,633
因为结果不是由你制造出来的

2775
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:26,466
那这意味着什么呢

2776
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:29,066
这意味着你已经决定真理将使你自由

2777
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,733
这在某种意义上独立于证据之外

2778
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:35,633
我家人已经学到的一件事 这需要很多学习 就是

2779
01:32:37,266 --> 01:32:43,466
至少在过去五年里 我会说有50次我们认为

2780
01:32:43,733 --> 01:32:48,200
我们会被我们周围发生的事情所击败 有时那些是大事 大概有10件像

2781
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:55,533
它们是公开且知名的 然后还有大约40件事情虽然不那么大 但仍然相当大

2782
01:32:55,666 --> 01:33:04,566
情况总是一样的 那就是热得像地狱几周 但最终会好转

2783
01:33:06,233 --> 01:33:11,533
总是 总是如此 但这并不意味着经历那段不好转的时期是愉快的

2784
01:33:12,233 --> 01:33:12,833
那是可怕的

2785
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:24,033
但到目前为止 我们已经能够放手舵柄 让波浪将我们带向它们将要带我们去的地方 而不是翻船

2786
01:33:25,933 --> 01:33:30,333
你认为拥有一个令你有动力的敌手有用吗

2787
01:33:30,466 --> 01:33:34,500
谈到你经历的一些情况 不是特别指那些情况

2788
01:33:34,633 --> 01:33:40,066
但我尽量避免把人或团体或想法之类的当作敌人

2789
01:33:40,066 --> 01:33:42,633
是的 不要制造不必要的敌人 但是

2790
01:33:43,733 --> 01:33:49,000
当你与某人对抗时 确实有额外的激情被点燃 我有时会想念它

2791
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:51,566
有时和平需要付出代价

2792
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:56,433
嗯 那么你就得更加努力地审视自己 找到你的敌手

2793
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,300
因为它一直都在那里

2794
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:07,800
我的意思是 你总是有自己可以克服的部分 所以这本质上就是威廉·詹姆斯提到的道德战争的替代品

2795
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:13,166
如果你需要某些东西来抗争 而你可能确实需要 你可以找到 你只需

2796
01:34:13,233 --> 01:34:16,833
向内看 你会找到一些东西来抗争 比如不足

2797
01:34:17,033 --> 01:34:22,500
弱点、诱惑的易感性、自恋、骄傲、嫉妒、复仇

2798
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:28,033
怨恨、挫折、缺乏信念 所有这些都将让你忙碌

2799
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:31,866
如果你真的与之抗争 是的 我的意思是这是一个古老的神学问题

2800
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,633
你知道 魔鬼是怎么回事

2801
01:34:34,666 --> 01:34:35,633
为什么会这样

2802
01:34:35,633 --> 01:34:37,300
为什么存在邪恶的可能性

2803
01:34:37,466 --> 01:34:43,800
为什么会有一个永恒的对手 看看创世记故事开头的该隐和亚伯 不就是反映了这一点吗

2804
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:54,433
本质上 前两个人在对抗对手方面表现出色 这就是打开历史的原因 你认为这个故事很好 为什么上帝要建造这样一个现实

2805
01:34:54,566 --> 01:35:00,100
为什么上帝要构造一个存在对手的现实 或许是因为

2806
01:35:00,233 --> 01:35:03,200
综合考虑下 一个有对手的世界是一个更好的世界

2807
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,866
就像一个园中有蛇的花园是一个更好的花园

2808
01:35:06,633 --> 01:35:08,100
这些事情不容易理解

2809
01:35:09,633 --> 01:35:12,966
没有蛇 就没有与蛇斗争的必要

2810
01:35:14,066 --> 01:35:15,766
那为什么要保持清醒呢

2811
01:35:16,633 --> 01:35:18,400
没有对手 就没有挑战

2812
01:35:19,066 --> 01:35:19,833
为什么要接受挑战

2813
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,966
因为或许你因挑战而变得更好

2814
01:35:24,233 --> 01:35:29,933
也许挑战在于看你是否能因挑战而变得更好 但那应该是内在的

2815
01:35:29,966 --> 01:35:30,033
嗯

2816
01:35:30,333 --> 01:35:36,133
如果不是内在的 你会在外部找到它 因为你会妖魔化某人 将他们变成撒旦 这样你就能找到一个对手 然后

2817
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:39,133
这对你和他们来说都很不幸

2818
01:35:39,133 --> 01:35:40,766
那就不算一场大战

2819
01:35:40,933 --> 01:35:44,600
就像你在与一个恶意的外部人作战

2820
01:35:44,733 --> 01:35:49,100
假设或者你认为他们是 通常你大部分都搞错了 但不总是

2821
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,066
但如果战斗在内部 那就是它应该在的地方

2822
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:55,233
但最根本的是

2823
01:35:57,533 --> 01:36:00,800
那么 那就是终极挑战 那就是无尽的游戏

2824
01:36:02,333 --> 01:36:06,400
外部的战斗是善与恶在混沌和秩序的战场上的战斗

2825
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:11,333
这是永恒的游戏 你知道 你可以在外部世界中演绎这一切

2826
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:16,600
但宗教企业的一部分意义在于

2827
01:36:17,233 --> 01:36:24,100
基督徒确实对此做出了贡献 那就是这场神圣战斗根本上是精神的

2828
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:30,900
也就是说从某种意义上说根本上是心理的 它是在灵魂的战场上进行的

2829
01:36:32,233 --> 01:36:34,800
在内部 这是一个主观问题

2830
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:35,666
你如何战胜恶

2831
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,133
你是在自己心中战胜恶

2832
01:36:39,833 --> 01:36:41,733
那就是你如何做到的

2833
01:36:43,033 --> 01:36:46,000
所以 如果这一切都在你的世界中为你所演绎

2834
01:36:46,033 --> 01:36:48,200
嗯 你就把撒旦放错了地方

2835
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:49,866
这是一个很好的思考方式

2836
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:51,600
这是另一个弱点

2837
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,433
我认为这是无神论立场的弱点 因为

2838
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:55,500
你可以 这相当困难

2839
01:36:55,733 --> 01:36:59,733
在某种意义上可以轻易地放弃对最高善的信仰

2840
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:02,700
但放弃对恶的信仰就没那么容易

2841
01:37:03,533 --> 01:37:04,966
所以这是一个大问题

2842
01:37:04,966 --> 01:37:10,233
那么你在哪里定位它 你当然可以在各处找到它的证据 特别是在机构中

2843
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:11,366
我的意思是 这就是全部

2844
01:37:11,933 --> 01:37:19,000
系统性种族主义 腐败的父权制叙述是 撒旦在我们的机构核心被发现 某种程度上

2845
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:24,466
这是真的 因为我们所做的一切在某种程度上都是腐败的

2846
01:37:24,466 --> 01:37:26,533
那么你从社会学角度来对抗它吗 

2847
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:31,400
你是好人 而机构是撒旦

2848
01:37:32,366 --> 01:37:33,600
所以你很好

2849
01:37:33,633 --> 01:37:33,833
是吗

2850
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:38,766
你这么确定你已经把一切都理顺了 或者你并没有吗

2851
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:45,933
你可能会说 在社会学前线对抗恶之前 你必须把一切都理顺吗

2852
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:50,000
答案是不 因为你永远不可能把一切都理顺 但

2853
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,166
你仍然不应该本末倒置

2854
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,266
这真的是一场精神战斗 人们花了

2855
01:37:58,933 --> 01:38:01,800
成千上万年才弄明白这一点

2856
01:38:01,833 --> 01:38:02,900
首先 是那条蛇

2857
01:38:04,133 --> 01:38:05,133
什么是邪恶的

2858
01:38:05,166 --> 01:38:08,533
什么是恶意的 是那种捕食性的爬行动物 公平说吧 人

2859
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:14,366
我的意思是 作为哺乳动物 我们与捕食性爬行动物战斗了6000万年 6000万年

2860
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:16,733
所以这是一个很好的初步模拟

2861
01:38:18,066 --> 01:38:21,933
就是那条蛇 那条有毒的蛇 外部的敌人 那个捕食者

2862
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,033
但其他人中的捕食者怎么样

2863
01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:27,933
是的 那更糟 伙计

2864
01:38:27,966 --> 01:38:33,066
就像信贷捕食者是一回事 但捕食性的人 其他部落的人 伙计

2865
01:38:33,733 --> 01:38:34,700
他们残忍

2866
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:35,200
他们残忍

2867
01:38:36,333 --> 01:38:36,433
哦

2868
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,066
那你那个捕食性的朋友呢

2869
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:45,633
那也很糟糕 背后捅你一刀的朋友 背叛你的人 犹大 上帝

2870
01:38:45,633 --> 01:38:47,166
也许那是最终的蛇

2871
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:49,833
就像 那你背叛自己怎么样

2872
01:38:51,933 --> 01:38:52,233
是的

2873
01:38:53,733 --> 01:38:55,133
你想看看这是什么

2874
01:38:55,500 --> 01:39:01,033
有一种非常奇怪的联系 在基督教思想的发展中 将伊甸园中的蛇与撒旦联系起来

2875
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:06,633
在原始故事中没有任何迹象表明蛇与万恶之源有任何关系

2876
01:39:07,833 --> 01:39:10,866
这是一个非常奇怪的 得出的结论

2877
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:16,400
这几乎是额外的圣经内容 因为圣经中几乎根本没有提到撒旦

2878
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:21,466
更不用说蛇和撒旦之间有任何直接联系了

2879
01:39:21,466 --> 01:39:23,233
这是一个非常非常奇怪的想法

2880
01:39:23,833 --> 01:39:26,966
但这是邪恶心理化的一部分

2881
01:39:26,966 --> 01:39:29,000
什么是终极捕食者

2882
01:39:29,033 --> 01:39:30,466
什么是终极捕食者

2883
01:39:31,333 --> 01:39:34,400
你心中怀有的、憎恨你的敌人是什么

2884
01:39:35,533 --> 01:39:36,566
那就是终极捕食者

2885
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,733
你知道 当有这些玛丽亚的形象

2886
01:39:43,033 --> 01:39:47,500
头顶星辰 怀抱婴儿 脚踩蛇的时候 就像 嗯

2887
01:39:48,833 --> 01:39:56,066
那是永恒的女性 头顶星辰 因为她面向最高的善 并且她保护她的婴儿免受捕食者的伤害

2888
01:39:56,833 --> 01:40:06,933
那可能是一个真实的捕食者 这不仅仅是人类历史 而是哺乳动物历史中的常态 也可能是其他作为捕食者的人

2889
01:40:08,133 --> 01:40:09,600
可能是作为捕食者的男性

2890
01:40:10,433 --> 01:40:11,033
可能是她

2891
01:40:12,633 --> 01:40:13,400
谁是捕食者

2892
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:15,366
是吞噬型的母亲

2893
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:21,666
就像 嗯 什么是真正邪恶的终极所在地

2894
01:40:22,533 --> 01:40:25,266
最高的宗教答案是 那在你内部

2895
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:27,966
那是战斗的正确地方

2896
01:40:28,933 --> 01:40:32,200
我认为那是真的

2897
01:40:32,233 --> 01:40:32,933
我认为那是真实的

2898
01:40:33,266 --> 01:40:34,833
那是字面上和比喻上都真实的

2899
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:51,600
我部分因为索尔仁尼琴的著作而被说服 因为索尔仁尼琴将极权国家与那个国家的臣民--同时也是施行者--愿意生活在谎言中相提并论

2900
01:40:53,533 --> 01:40:57,266
没有 没有法律 没有极权国家 如果人们不撒谎

2901
01:40:58,766 --> 01:41:04,433
每次你为支持极权国家而撒谎 那么你就是施行者 那是一个心理问题

2902
01:41:04,566 --> 01:41:06,200
就像 你是为了相处而撒谎还是不撒谎

2903
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,500
说 那又怎么样

2904
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:10,333
我会顺从它

2905
01:41:10,366 --> 01:41:11,200
没关系

2906
01:41:12,566 --> 01:41:18,700
我们会看到这有什么关系 因为这很重要 就我而言 这全是一场心理剧

2907
01:41:20,033 --> 01:41:22,033
从根本上说 当它被正确放置时

2908
01:41:23,633 --> 01:41:26,166
你自己前面有足够的问题要处理

2909
01:41:26,233 --> 01:41:29,633
那就是你应该集中精力的地方

2910
01:41:31,966 --> 01:41:36,700
我意识到的一件事是 那些自省的人 那些

2911
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:43,400
依靠脑力的人 那些注意的人 那些以详细方式思考的人 你的思考越是细腻

2912
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:48,733
像你一样的人就越少 这使你感到更孤独

2913
01:41:49,566 --> 01:41:50,733
你认为人们如何克服这一点

2914
01:41:55,466 --> 01:42:02,766
嗯 我要说 这并不完全是我的经历 因为当我开始公开我的想法

2915
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:07,566
它们似乎吸引了越来越多的人

2916
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:12,666
所以我不知道这是否是一个阈值现象 因为也许是 你知道的

2917
01:42:13,866 --> 01:42:19,066
当你开始作为一名科学家变得专业化 在某种意义上 你的视野变得越来越窄

2918
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:24,366
虽然在你操作的层面上分辨率变得更高 但你有点..

2919
01:42:24,433 --> 01:42:31,500
就像穿过针眼 可以说 从另一边出来时 你研究的东西开始再次变成一切

2920
01:42:32,466 --> 01:42:35,933
所以也许这就是那种发展进程

2921
01:42:36,466 --> 01:42:37,100
进一步来说

2922
01:42:37,466 --> 01:42:38,866
是的 专业化然后……

2923
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:40,333
再次泛化

2924
01:42:41,233 --> 01:42:43,900
是的 我认为你在这里可能是对的 更深入破裂的事情

2925
01:42:44,300 --> 01:42:47,833
我去曼彻斯特看你2017年或18年的演讲时 有人问

2926
01:42:49,666 --> 01:42:57,600
关于我的意识深度导致我受苦的问题 你说你会服用更多毒害你的东西 直到你将它转变成环绕你的世界的补药

2927
01:42:57,700 --> 01:43:05,666
你认为这也是你在这里看到的 当你开始以不同的方式思考 当你开始考虑你以一种

2928
01:43:06,466 --> 01:43:13,700
更详细、更高分辨率、更独特、更细腻的方式生活你的生活时 你可能会得到反馈

2929
01:43:13,866 --> 01:43:18,200
特别是从个人经验来说 在一个普通的工人阶级城镇

2930
01:43:18,366 --> 01:43:24,433
人们在这些地方出生、生活、死亡 它是与世隔绝的 没有巨大的文化 

2931
01:43:26,133 --> 01:43:29,700
尤其是在英国 高罂粟综合症是一个大问题

2932
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:36,900
实际上注意到的最大差异 是美国人和英国人之间 美国孩子被告知他们可以成为任何他们想成为的

2933
01:43:37,033 --> 01:43:41,000
他们想要的 他们被告知他们有蓝天愿景

2934
01:43:41,066 --> 01:43:45,066
他们可以实现他们想要的任何东西 这给了他们很多信心 当我们

2935
01:43:45,633 --> 01:43:48,966
英国人 古板的英国人在电视上看美国人时

2936
01:43:49,233 --> 01:43:53,900
听起来就像每个人都接受了媒体训练 因为每个人都对任何事情都如此热情

2937
01:43:54,100 --> 01:44:00,533
即使是18车连环相撞 而在英国的相应情况是

2938
01:44:01,833 --> 01:44:06,600
偏离常规很快就会被嘲笑

2939
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:06,833
嗯嗯 而且

2940
01:44:07,966 --> 01:44:10,266
在加拿大也有很多这样的情况 高个子罂粟综合症

2941
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:11,700
现在这是一个大问题

2942
01:44:11,733 --> 01:44:20,700
日本人也有这样的说法 只不过是凸出的钉子最先被锤子敲下

2943
01:44:22,066 --> 01:44:28,266
确实有一些真理在其中 有一些是真的 但“一些”和“全部”是非常不同的词

2944
01:44:29,366 --> 01:44:34,233
当你将时间向前推进 最终你得到的是那些

2945
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:39,200
成为成年人的美国孩子 他们环顾四周 说 等等 这不是我被承诺的

2946
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,933
我被告知我可以成为我想成为的任何人

2947
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,900
我被告知我可以拥有我想要的任何东西

2948
01:44:44,933 --> 01:44:50,733
你可以赚到所有可赚的东西和你应得所有东西之间有差异

2949
01:44:52,366 --> 01:44:58,033
所以那信息可能变成你说的 它可以在自恋的方式中被误解

2950
01:44:58,633 --> 01:45:02,500
我认为这在某种程度上确实发生了 特别是当人们越来越少有孩子的时候

2951
01:45:04,733 --> 01:45:09,200
你知道 Jonathan Haidt 和 Luke Enough 谈到了对美国心灵的溺爱

2952
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:15,033
他们认为这在很大程度上是一次意识形态转变的后果 并且

2953
01:45:16,066 --> 01:45:22,200
有些是真的 但也有用的是去观察更基本的现象

2954
01:45:23,966 --> 01:45:25,433
人们在年纪大得多的时候才生孩子

2955
01:45:26,566 --> 01:45:28,600
他们的孩子数量远少于以前

2956
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:31,300
当他们有孩子的时候 平均来说 他们拥有更多的资源

2957
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,133
你知道 如果你是八个孩子中的一个

2958
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:39,266
你基本上是在为了非常有限的父母注意力而战斗 与很多激烈的竞争

2959
01:45:39,466 --> 01:45:48,800
你变得有权和自恋的可能性非常低 因为你的兄弟姐妹绝对会为此惩罚你

2960
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:54,500
但如果你是唯一的孩子 尤其是年龄较大的父母的孩子 他们也因为年龄而更保守 并且

2961
01:45:55,033 --> 01:46:00,700
也不愿意因为你只有一个而冒险 那么你就有了大量的资源可供使用

2962
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:02,500
嗯 那就完全不同了

2963
01:46:02,533 --> 01:46:08,233
那是一个完全不同的成长环境 我们不知道这会有什么后果

2964
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:15,766
但是这样一种观点 即在这种情况下的孩子更有可能被过度保护、依赖和受限制

2965
01:46:15,833 --> 01:46:17,166
就像 嗯 是的

2966
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:24,766
无疑的 你知道 这甚至可以在某种意义上说是父母美德的过剩 对吗

2967
01:46:25,533 --> 01:46:27,866
嗯 我们只是不停地关注我们的孩子

2968
01:46:29,266 --> 01:46:32,666
好吧 但这太多了

2969
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:34,000
你期望什么

2970
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,066
这很奇怪 因为我是独生子 对吧 所有的什么

2971
01:46:38,066 --> 01:46:44,066
嗯 也许我的朋友会有不同的说法 但很多关于独生子女的普遍假设

2972
01:46:44,133 --> 01:46:49,466
我只是 我有几个朋友也是

2973
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:53,800
我不知道这是否是因为我们来自英国东北部 那里非常朴实无华

2974
01:46:54,033 --> 01:47:02,466
那里是朴实的人民 你知道 拉紧你的靴带和靴子 开始拉扯 我就没看到那样的情况

2975
01:47:03,233 --> 01:47:06,466
通过你的临床实践是怎样的

2976
01:47:06,966 --> 01:47:12,500
这可能不仅仅是一个工人阶级现象 你知道 被溺爱的心态现象

2977
01:47:12,766 --> 01:47:15,366
那完全可能是一个中产阶级 上层阶级的现象

2978
01:47:16,066 --> 01:47:23,900
有没有一些共同的趋势 或者你从阅读中发现独生子女倾向于某种方式

2979
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:27,500
所以你也发现了他们之间巨大的差异

2980
01:47:28,066 --> 01:47:31,900
我不知道个体心理数据层面的答案

2981
01:47:32,066 --> 01:47:33,700
可能有文献 我不知道

2982
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:37,200
对我来说 这更多是对海德关于被溺爱的心态的书的回应

2983
01:47:37,266 --> 01:47:40,233
我想 好吧 公平说 美国心灵的溺爱

2984
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:41,433
是什么驱动了这一切

2985
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:43,200
不仅仅是想法

2986
01:47:43,333 --> 01:47:44,700
这是一个巨大的人口转变

2987
01:47:44,866 --> 01:47:47,033
这是我们抚养孩子方式的巨大转变

2988
01:47:47,533 --> 01:47:49,200
我们现在生孩子时平均年龄大了10岁

2989
01:47:49,633 --> 01:47:50,400
那年纪大很多

2990
01:47:50,933 --> 01:47:52,866
你知道 当你18岁有了孩子 你自己还是个孩子

2991
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:56,266
那样可能有一些不太好的狂野之处

2992
01:47:56,433 --> 01:48:00,966
但也许还有更高的倾向去过自己的生活

2993
01:48:02,166 --> 01:48:07,066
然后 你知道 孩子们应该多大程度上独处 

2994
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:09,766
答案是尽可能多地留给他们

2995
01:48:11,366 --> 01:48:12,133
那会是多少呢

2996
01:48:12,733 --> 01:48:21,466
好吧 你会在每个孩子身上找到答案 但肯定有可能没有充分剥夺你的孩子的权利 

2997
01:48:23,233 --> 01:48:31,300
所以我意识到 当你发现一件你要全力以赴的事情时 那是很可怕的

2998
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:35,433
尤其是如果你追求的是卓越

2999
01:48:35,933 --> 01:48:38,333
因为你的不足再也没有地方可以隐藏了

3000
01:48:39,266 --> 01:48:44,633
你不能在事情变得艰难时决定改变方向做别的事情了

3001
01:48:44,633 --> 01:48:45,933
没有更多的逃生舱 对吧

3002
01:48:46,333 --> 01:48:47,133
我已经承诺了这件事

3003
01:48:47,133 --> 01:48:47,766
这是我的事情

3004
01:48:47,766 --> 01:48:49,800
这是你的一条规则 你知道 承诺某事就是

3005
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:53,733
是的 尽可能努力地承诺至少一件事 看看会发生什么

3006
01:48:53,833 --> 01:49:00,566
是的 精确地将自己定位于一个方向 我和我的来访者有一个规则 因为你知道 你可能会说

3007
01:49:00,733 --> 01:49:02,900
我已经走了这条路的一半 然后发现这是错误的

3008
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,266
那么 你如何区分这和放弃有什么不同

3009
01:49:06,266 --> 01:49:07,966
嗯 这是一个非常困难的问题 对吧

3010
01:49:07,966 --> 01:49:08,800
这是一个道德风险

3011
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:13,733
因为继续沿着你现在意识到是错误的方向前进是不恰当的

3012
01:49:14,433 --> 01:49:18,366
但放弃并以此为借口也是不适当的

3013
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:23,333
尤其是考虑到我们对自己不是完全透明的情况下 你如何区分

3014
01:49:23,333 --> 01:49:23,900
嗯 确实如此

3015
01:49:24,433 --> 01:49:26,000
所以这确实是一个道德风险

3016
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:35,300
所以我在治疗讨论中试图遵循的原则之一是 你可以改变方向 只要你接下来做的事情难度相等或更大

3017
01:49:36,433 --> 01:49:38,866
因为这是防止仅仅是放弃的一种检验

3018
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:40,433
所以

3019
01:49:41,833 --> 01:49:45,733
你要约束自己 让自己有条不紊 这样你就可以朝着一个特定的方向前进

3020
01:49:46,333 --> 01:49:47,800
这样当你找到正确的方向时

3021
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:51,666
你可以真正朝那个方向前进 这确实需要一种学徒期

3022
01:49:52,433 --> 01:49:58,200
在某种意义上 学徒期的具体形式可能并不重要 只要它是严格的

3023
01:50:00,233 --> 01:50:04,466
对 所以这是道德相对主义和道德绝对主义之间的一种桥梁

3024
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:07,566
有很多游戏你可以玩

3025
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:11,800
哪个游戏是最好的在事先并不明显

3026
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:14,400
所以这是一种道德相对的立场

3027
01:50:14,433 --> 01:50:17,933
有多个可以玩的游戏

3028
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:21,633
但绝对的是 是的 但你必须玩其中一个

3029
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:25,833
你必须学会玩其中一个 并至少在其中一个领域成为专家

3030
01:50:26,566 --> 01:50:32,066
然后 这不是一个相对的主张 我相信这是真的

3031
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:35,200
在我看来 情况确实如此 所以你想承诺某事并且

3032
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:50,066
当你承诺某事时 你要求自己将所有不同的组成部分统一朝着一个方向前进

3033
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:55,466
所以这是一个统一的行为 一旦统一

3034
01:50:56,633 --> 01:51:02,366
那么 你就可以将这种统一用于多种不同的任务 但首先你必须将其聚集在一起

3035
01:51:03,666 --> 01:51:14,033
所以 从发展角度来看 这是有意义的 你看孩子们开始作为一团各自为战的动机和情感的混合体

3036
01:51:14,900 --> 01:51:18,166
然后他们可以将其整合成他们可以自我玩耍的单一游戏

3037
01:51:19,233 --> 01:51:22,066
然后他们开始与其他人玩耍时也将其整合

3038
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,866
所有这些都是整合

3039
01:51:24,866 --> 01:51:27,133
这不是征服 不是压抑

3040
01:51:27,533 --> 01:51:30,066
如果是好游戏 那就是整合

3041
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:35,166
你想要整合 因为那样你有所有拉动你战车的马匹

3042
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:37,000
朝着同一个方向拉

3043
01:51:37,700 --> 01:51:39,866
那样你就更有可能到达你想去的地方

3044
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:42,666
也更有可能指定一个好的去处

3045
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:51,033
所以这是保守派必须教给年轻人的另一件事 即 让自己有纪律

3046
01:51:52,233 --> 01:51:53,733
为什么

3047
01:51:53,766 --> 01:52:00,133
不是为了让你成为奴隶 而是为了让你能成为主人 用你不再应该使用的术语来说

3048
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:05,033
但是 你知道 这是与自己的关系 而不是与他人

3049
01:52:06,566 --> 01:52:13,800
所以 是的 开始时 你必须接受一个外部的导师

3050
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:17,400
因为你就是没有智慧、能力或机会来为自己做这件事

3051
01:52:20,466 --> 01:52:25,366
每个人都知道这一点 你知道 当他们决定

3052
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:29,833
要让自己保持良好的状态并去健身房 而这样的尝试仅持续了三次 是的

3053
01:52:31,366 --> 01:52:36,400
然后他们中没有人对他们退出感到高兴 他们会因此而自责

3054
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:41,933
我们知道我们需要经历一个纪律过程 我们需要将自己纳入一个纪律过程

3055
01:52:42,433 --> 01:52:47,066
这是对持续抱怨你知道的 压迫性父权的问题之一

3056
01:52:48,466 --> 01:52:49,800
你需要一个纪律过程

3057
01:52:51,266 --> 01:52:51,400
所以

3058
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:54,766
那就是压迫和奴役

3059
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,000
就像不 它不是

3060
01:52:57,533 --> 01:52:58,533
不比一个游戏更多

3061
01:52:59,666 --> 01:53:02,333
不是一个好游戏 好游戏不是压迫和奴役

3062
01:53:02,666 --> 01:53:08,533
我们看到 准时被归咎于某种压迫性至上

3063
01:53:08,566 --> 01:53:09,200
是的 显然

3064
01:53:11,066 --> 01:53:15,900
是的 它完全是愚蠢的 我是说即使在科学层面

3065
01:53:15,966 --> 01:53:21,466
那是特质之一 准时是一部分的条理性和责任感

3066
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:26,366
勤奋 没有任何证据表明这因种族或人种而异

3067
01:53:26,466 --> 01:53:33,966
至上主义 是的 或至上主义 有证据表明 如果你是这样的人 你更可能是至上的

3068
01:53:34,033 --> 01:53:35,533
嗯 你更有可能成功

3069
01:53:35,566 --> 01:53:39,700
它是最决定性的 它是最...

3070
01:53:41,066 --> 01:53:47,566
在算法领域、管理、行政领域中成功的最强大个性预测器

3071
01:53:48,733 --> 01:53:57,166
所以努力工作是有效的 实际上 努力工作的有效程度实际上是衡量一个社会健康的唯一指标

3072
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:03,000
比如 勤奋和结果之间的相关性越高 社会就越健康

3073
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,833
嗯 显然 为什么呢 嗯

3074
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:10,266
你希望大部分的赞誉归于最有生产力的人

3075
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:10,433
我的意思是

3076
01:54:11,233 --> 01:54:14,033
不是因为他们应得的 即使在某种意义上不是因为他们应得的

3077
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:17,233
因为“应得”的确切含义是什么

3078
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:19,533
这是因为他们应得的 但是

3079
01:54:20,266 --> 01:54:21,966
那个词是一个黑盒

3080
01:54:21,966 --> 01:54:25,133
这是因为如果你希望他们继续创造东西

3081
01:54:25,433 --> 01:54:31,300
你必须这样做 你希望他们这样做 因为 或者说 你不想要食物吗

3082
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:32,133
你不想要住所吗

3083
01:54:33,766 --> 01:54:36,966
为什么你不对提供它们的人提供特殊奖励呢

3084
01:54:38,466 --> 01:54:43,400
即使是出于你自己狭隘的自我利益 也需要这样做

3085
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:44,733
所以

3086
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:52,733
承诺一件事以及（随之而来的）不可避免的痛苦 因为它们不再是一件容易的事

3087
01:54:52,933 --> 01:54:54,500
我已经决定这是我的事

3088
01:54:54,533 --> 01:54:55,833
我正在追求它

3089
01:54:55,833 --> 01:55:00,433
是的 将一个时间参数或一个成就参数附加上去是有用的

3090
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:01,666
这就是为什么

3091
01:55:03,166 --> 01:55:03,833
六个月

3092
01:55:03,866 --> 01:55:04,666
是的

3093
01:55:04,666 --> 01:55:05,000
是的

3094
01:55:05,033 --> 01:55:07,500
嗯 无论如何我都要拿到这个学位

3095
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:09,533
嗯 这是一个时间限制

3096
01:55:09,533 --> 01:55:13,700
它不是你的一生 但你承诺了那个 然后你确实将自己限制住了

3097
01:55:13,966 --> 01:55:15,333
就像 嗯 我在这个盒子里

3098
01:55:15,366 --> 01:55:16,366
我必须尽力而为

3099
01:55:16,366 --> 01:55:16,800
没错

3100
01:55:17,866 --> 01:55:20,000
你在这个盒子里 你必须尽力而为

3101
01:55:20,266 --> 01:55:22,000
所以 你可能会说 嗯 我不想在盒子里

3102
01:55:22,366 --> 01:55:26,233
像 你确定你不想在盒子里吗 盒子是一座堡垒

3103
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:29,466
墙壁能把龙挡在外面 你想要在一个盒子里

3104
01:55:30,333 --> 01:55:32,100
天堂是一个有墙的花园

3105
01:55:33,333 --> 01:55:35,500
它不是没有墙的花园

3106
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:37,933
它有墙 对吗 你有一个房子

3107
01:55:37,933 --> 01:55:39,933
它有墙 你有一个房间 它有墙

3108
01:55:41,966 --> 01:55:46,533
你不想在盒子外面 选择你的该死的盒子 然后弄清楚如何将它变成一个花园

3109
01:55:47,666 --> 01:55:49,500
嗯 我想要一个没有墙的盒子

3110
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:51,900
不 你不想 那里只有蛇

3111
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:57,000
是的 你昨晚在谈论关于关系时提到了这一点

3112
01:55:57,033 --> 01:55:57,333
嗯

3113
01:55:57,333 --> 01:56:04,333
你说当你向某人承诺时 就有了不可避免的痛苦

3114
01:56:04,566 --> 01:56:08,933
任何未来的灾难都需要在你和你承诺的那个人之间以一种困难的方式解决

3115
01:56:09,366 --> 01:56:11,033
而不是你能够离开

3116
01:56:11,066 --> 01:56:11,900
哦 好吧 酷

3117
01:56:11,933 --> 01:56:12,533
我要离开了

3118
01:56:12,533 --> 01:56:14,800
无论如何 Tinder上的备胎总是暖着的

3119
01:56:14,966 --> 01:56:15,500
我走了

3120
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:16,866
是的 对 对 对

3121
01:56:16,866 --> 01:56:19,300
嗯 这是我从阅读卡尔·荣格中真正学到的东西

3122
01:56:19,333 --> 01:56:20,933
他将婚姻视为

3123
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:23,633
他用炼金术的象征性来描述

3124
01:56:28,266 --> 01:56:28,766
净化

3125
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:30,533
需要热量

3126
01:56:32,433 --> 01:56:33,033
热量和压力

3127
01:56:34,566 --> 01:56:36,633
所以你有一个容器 它变热了

3128
01:56:37,866 --> 01:56:44,200
那就是你想离开的时候 那就是变化可以发生的时候 有时这些变化必须是激进的 以维持关系

3129
01:56:45,866 --> 01:56:48,933
非常激进 但希望这些激进的变化是积极的

3130
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:54,433
但是你怎么知道如果在你身下没有火在烤着你 你会做出这些变化呢 其中一个火就是我无法逃离

3131
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:55,900
从这里离开你

3132
01:56:55,933 --> 01:56:57,866
我们就在这里 锁定在这场战斗中

3133
01:56:57,866 --> 01:57:00,066
我们处于这种对抗关系 这是有益的

3134
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:02,233
是的 确切地说是有益的对手

3135
01:57:02,366 --> 01:57:07,000
是的 除了穿越外没有其他出路 而且没有证据表明穿越会奏效

3136
01:57:08,566 --> 01:57:08,766
但是

3137
01:57:10,533 --> 01:57:13,433
所以誓言的部分用途就是提高温度

3138
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:17,866
你知道你可能会说 嗯 我会逃跑 但问题是

3139
01:57:19,433 --> 01:57:20,133
逃到哪里

3140
01:57:21,166 --> 01:57:26,633
你不会有另一段关系 如果你将灾难带到了前一段关系

3141
01:57:26,766 --> 01:57:29,933
这至少有50-50的可能性 对吗

3142
01:57:31,166 --> 01:57:32,966
你怎么知道你不会将它带到下一段关系

3143
01:57:32,966 --> 01:57:34,966
你是你所有经历的共同分母

3144
01:57:35,033 --> 01:57:37,766
对 我有很多糟糕的关系

3145
01:57:37,766 --> 01:57:38,733
真的吗

3146
01:57:40,466 --> 01:57:41,966
我从未遇到过我可以信任的人

3147
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:42,900
好的

3148
01:57:42,933 --> 01:57:43,066
啊

3149
01:57:46,333 --> 01:57:47,866
每个人都是出于权力的动机

3150
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:51,833
这里的共同分母是什么

3151
01:57:51,833 --> 01:57:52,533
确切地

3152
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:56,166
所以 你知道 这很棘手 因为我

3153
01:57:56,733 --> 01:57:59,500
我的意思是 我家里很多人都离过婚

3154
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:04,166
离婚 这几乎是每个家庭的情况 我不觉得我有资格指责人们

3155
01:58:04,366 --> 01:58:09,666
告诉他们你知道你失败了 如果你更努力你本可以成功

3156
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:25,466
这不由我来决定 许多人已经在第二次尝试时拥有了更成功的关系 但这并不否定最初的观点

3157
01:58:25,633 --> 01:58:36,000
而且 即使是经历了离婚的人也想要再次结婚 他们仍然看到誓言和承诺的价值

3158
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:40,866
所以 你知道 你不能把这些事情变成不可侵犯的绝对

3159
01:58:40,866 --> 01:58:45,266
零离婚 零毒品 零气候变化

3160
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:48,700
不 世界不是这样运作的

3161
01:58:48,733 --> 01:58:51,300
部分原因是因为花园里总会有蛇 对吧

3162
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:53,566
没有零

3163
01:58:53,566 --> 01:59:00,666
不是没有施加越来越多的极权主义力量 必须有一些回旋余地

3164
01:59:00,733 --> 01:59:05,366
但你不会仅仅为了提供一些回旋余地就破坏整个系统 这是很难协商的

3165
01:59:06,766 --> 01:59:13,933
你知道 我有来访者 他们的伴侣真的无法协商 整个协商的概念

3166
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:23,066
都是不可协商的 我看不出他们除了维持这个沉重的负担并沉沦或离开之外还有什么选择

3167
01:59:24,466 --> 01:59:29,166
这是一个可怕的选择 但这并不意味着婚姻是一个任何人都不应进入的监狱

3168
01:59:30,900 --> 01:59:32,433
这只是意味着事情很复杂

3169
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:38,966
追求绝对值总是以 卡尔·纽波特关于电子邮件的说法 非常有趣的见解而告终

3170
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:43,400
他说 你在任何事情上遇到的问题之一是 当你将成本

3171
01:59:43,633 --> 01:59:50,366
降低到字面上的零 你会遇到很多你没想到的奇怪外部效应

3172
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:53,566
他提出了一个观点 每封电子邮件应该花费5便士

3173
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:54,366
对 对

3174
01:59:54,366 --> 01:59:56,633
如果每封电子邮件花费5便士 你收到的邮件会减少90%

3175
01:59:57,400 --> 01:59:58,333
对 对 对

3176
01:59:58,333 --> 01:59:58,933
是的 是的

3177
01:59:58,966 --> 02:00:07,700
正确的 我们在构建这些程序以帮助人们时经常遇到这个问题

3178
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:13,600
所以和我的同事们一起 他们都是心理学家 一个是临床心理学家 另一个是研究心理学家

3179
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:17,566
我们构建了性格测试来帮助人们理解他们的性格

3180
02:00:18,233 --> 02:00:24,366
这也产生了夫妻报告 以便你可以理解你和你的伴侣在性格层面上的差异

3181
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:33,766
我们生产了一系列的写作程序 帮助人们写自传和分析他们的美德和缺点以及为未来制定计划

3182
02:00:34,366 --> 02:00:37,400
而且 你知道 一个问题是 为什么不免费提供

3183
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:41,833
答案是因为零不是正确的成本

3184
02:00:42,900 --> 02:00:43,866
现在什么是正确的成本

3185
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,233
这真的很棘手

3186
02:00:45,333 --> 02:00:49,333
这就是为什么你有市场 它是为了确定什么是正确的成本

3187
02:00:50,066 --> 02:00:53,566
就像我们卖出去的这些比我们本来想免费赠送的要多得多

3188
02:00:54,233 --> 02:00:58,600
部分原因是人们认为如果它不花钱就一文不值 而且

3189
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:03,633
部分原因是它并不是免费的 因为我们实际上努力了

3190
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:10,366
嗯 我的一个合作伙伴几乎全职工作了15年在这个项目上

3191
02:01:11,133 --> 02:01:16,500
以远低于平均工资 大概是他在私营领域可能赚的十分之一

3192
02:01:16,966 --> 02:01:20,466
如果他出去按照市场化来售卖他的技能的话 因为他是一个才华横溢的程序员

3193
02:01:20,466 --> 02:01:24,500
他拥有心理学博士学位 受过极好的教育 成就非凡

3194
02:01:25,133 --> 02:01:31,433
他完全可以在其他私营领域赚取一大笔财富

3195
02:01:31,666 --> 02:01:36,300
他以远低于平均工资工作了15年 直到我们在这一领域取得一点点成功

3196
02:01:37,133 --> 02:01:40,200
所以这绝对不是免费的

3197
02:01:41,533 --> 02:01:45,100
这对我们来说代价极大 所以然后

3198
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:51,633
然后说因为某人可能会说 如果你真的关心人类的福祉

3199
02:01:51,733 --> 02:01:54,600
你就不会从你的救赎努力中赚钱

3200
02:01:54,633 --> 02:01:54,900
就像

3201
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:57,400
你对此了解多少

3202
02:01:58,566 --> 02:01:59,100
确切地

3203
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:01,000
你尝试过构建并市场化某物吗

3204
02:02:01,033 --> 02:02:02,766
你知道这需要什么吗

3205
02:02:02,833 --> 02:02:10,833
是的 首先 你是否构建了一些有效且可扩展的东西 帮助你证明了它的有效性

3206
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:11,900
你已经做到了这些

3207
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:18,466
这就像你只完成了百分之五的路程 伙计 因为你认为现在你有了一个好东西 人们会排队来使用它

3208
02:02:19,533 --> 02:02:22,166
九十五百分的问题在于市场营销和沟通

3209
02:02:22,166 --> 02:02:25,066
你尝试过宣传你构建的产品吗

3210
02:02:25,900 --> 02:02:31,133
没有 你告诉我 因为我试图从这个中赚取足够的钱

3211
02:02:31,166 --> 02:02:37,233
来证明它的存在 确保我以一种人们真正需要的方式设计它

3212
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:44,533
你可以从他们愿意为它支付的价格中看出 以一种能够维持并允许它成长的方式 同时尝试奖励那些开发它的人

3213
02:02:45,266 --> 02:02:46,133
这全都是错误的吗

3214
02:02:47,033 --> 02:02:47,733
你知道的

3215
02:02:49,433 --> 02:02:56,433
所以不 我有一套关于不平等的空洞公理 我在道德上评判你

3216
02:02:56,533 --> 02:03:01,000
这些被不明智的使用 因为那比思考更容易

3217
02:03:02,733 --> 02:03:03,766
这就是这个论点的走向

3218
02:03:04,466 --> 02:03:05,066
这只是不合理的

3219
02:03:05,700 --> 02:03:08,233
价格是质量的指标 也是一种承诺工具

3220
02:03:08,633 --> 02:03:11,766
这是一个粗略的指标 但它比我们拥有的任何其他指标都要好

3221
02:03:12,433 --> 02:03:15,366
你知道 通常 如果你想买一套西装 更贵的西装更好

3222
02:03:16,233 --> 02:03:16,800
但不总是这样

3223
02:03:17,333 --> 02:03:18,200
人们会操纵这一点 对吧

3224
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:19,200
是的 没错

3225
02:03:19,233 --> 02:03:23,600
在在线空间 他们决定提高某物的价格 而那本应是十分之一或百分之一

3226
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:29,933
我在想詹姆斯·克利尔的《原子习惯》 这是去年2021年世界上最畅销的非小说书籍 它很棒

3227
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:36,433
他以某种价格销售这本书 Kindle版8英镑 平装版12英镑

3228
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:46,300
如果他决定发布一个关于《原子习惯》的在线课程 60天成就新的自我或

3229
02:03:46,433 --> 02:03:47,366
类似的东西 那就是500英镑或1000英镑

3230
02:03:50,833 --> 02:04:00,766
所以现在出现了这种奇怪的紧张关系 那些有能力改善他人生活的人 我知道很多作者是从在线课程空间转向写作领域

3231
02:04:00,833 --> 02:04:05,366
他们开始考虑 好吧 我已经赚到了钱

3232
02:04:06,100 --> 02:04:13,733
因为人们愿意为在线课程支付的费用是如此不成比例

3233
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:19,433
我认为这种情况的原因是 人们在寻找很多个人发展书籍的结果 他们觉得通过做课程 因为它会更加便于应用

3234
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:25,100
会更接近结果

3235
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:34,800
而且 事实也是 几乎没有人读书 听和看对人们来说更容易得多 大约多十倍 而且

3236
02:04:35,866 --> 02:04:40,300
这实际上已经开始 它已经在影响作者市场了

3237
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:43,066
我会说 我的意思是 我之前和萨姆·哈里斯讨论过这个问题

3238
02:04:43,333 --> 02:04:52,100
不管他是否在写作 他告诉我 我希望我说的是对的 肯定不是在批评萨姆 无论如何 机会成本太高了

3239
02:04:53,033 --> 02:04:57,900
我的意思是 看看我们现在制作的视频 可能会有一百万人观看

3240
02:04:58,533 --> 02:05:07,133
如果我想写另一本书 让一百万人阅读 那将花费我两年的写作时间 然后是一年的市场营销时间

3241
02:05:07,233 --> 02:05:13,800
即使我已经是一名成功的作者 这种可能性仍然非常低 而我们可以在两个小时内做到这一点 触达一百万人

3242
02:05:14,233 --> 02:05:19,900
萨姆说他总是不断地发现更紧急的事情要做 对 就是这样 对吧

3243
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:26,300
对 对 我是说 线上通信的速度和频率简直疯狂

3244
02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:26,733
想想你的

3245
02:05:27,966 --> 02:05:32,700
你那个是谁 那个让你在纳什维尔做讲座系列的

3246
02:05:32,966 --> 02:05:34,933
是皮亚杰 皮亚杰

3247
02:05:34,966 --> 02:05:35,900
是的 对

3248
02:05:35,900 --> 02:05:37,733
那花了多长时间 两个半天

3249
02:05:39,033 --> 02:05:43,100
加上准备 大概三个半天加上一周的准备 对吗 是的 对吗

3250
02:05:44,366 --> 02:05:46,166
对 这有多疯狂啊

3251
02:05:46,166 --> 02:05:47,133
是的 绝对的

3252
02:05:47,166 --> 02:05:49,833
嗯 然后没有出版的延迟

3253
02:05:50,766 --> 02:05:57,300
对 而且它是一个不断增长的平台 可触及的人数是书本的十倍 现在它和书本一样永久了

3254
02:05:57,500 --> 02:05:59,066
你可能会问 为什么还要写书

3255
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:01,466
这实际上是一个真正的问题

3256
02:06:01,466 --> 02:06:02,000
这是一个问题

3257
02:06:02,033 --> 02:06:03,433
我问过自己 因为

3258
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:07,700
我下一本书中探索的一些主题

3259
02:06:07,700 --> 02:06:10,400
我已经在YouTube视频中谈论过了

3260
02:06:10,433 --> 02:06:12,633
比方说 它们引起了相当爆炸性的

3261
02:06:13,666 --> 02:06:16,566
对某些想法的反应

3262
02:06:16,566 --> 02:06:18,533
我谈论了十字架的本质和

3263
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:24,766
以及十字架的形象与蛇的形象之间的关系

3264
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:27,466
我在罗根的节目上谈论了这个 那是大约两周前

3265
02:06:27,666 --> 02:06:32,300
我认为大概有50万人看过那个片段 那比畅销书还要多

3266
02:06:33,633 --> 02:06:41,433
立即就能达到 那我为什么还要写这本书 答案是 没有什么比写书更需要你深入思考了

3267
02:06:42,133 --> 02:06:48,166
所以在这方面还是有智力上的优势 很多我能够如此迅速地说出来的东西

3268
02:06:48,633 --> 02:06:53,233
比如我在罗根节目上所做的 你知道 需要30年来思考 因为你写过那些

3269
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:54,400
是的

3270
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:57,433
嗯 我发现我的时事通讯 我每周做一次

3271
02:06:59,566 --> 02:07:02,133
它综合了我过去七天学到的东西 对吧

3272
02:07:02,300 --> 02:07:06,233
我需要 你知道 几个小时来写或者类似的东西 它不到一千字

3273
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:08,733
你可以在三分钟内读完 三分钟 周一 嗯嗯 而且

3274
02:07:09,866 --> 02:07:09,966
而且

3275
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:15,766
我现在所珍视的很多东西 我与朋友或在播客上谈论的 是一些冒牌者适应

3276
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:17,500
你知道 那是我一直在思考的东西

3277
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:19,333
我想知道我能不能用500字写下来

3278
02:07:19,900 --> 02:07:24,733
我想知道我能否用日常语言简练地表达 但这实际上是让你所做的具体化

3279
02:07:24,966 --> 02:07:27,666
这就是为什么我说那些没有出口的人

3280
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:30,766
如果他们没有对话的机会

3281
02:07:30,866 --> 02:07:36,866
但也可能是如果他们没有机会写下他们所思考的 他们的思考只是概念

3282
02:07:37,100 --> 02:07:37,900
只是概念

3283
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:42,866
它们只是这样 就像是一种低分辨率、短暂、难以把握、含糊不清的东西

3284
02:07:43,633 --> 02:07:48,233
将其从你的大脑中用文字表达出来 对某人说或写给某人

3285
02:07:48,966 --> 02:07:51,333
看看会发生什么 那么它就具体化了

3286
02:07:51,333 --> 02:07:53,733
嗯 它也编辑了 因为当你写作时

3287
02:07:54,733 --> 02:07:57,166
部分是启示性的 你写下你的想法 但是

3288
02:07:58,133 --> 02:08:00,766
你从无数的启示中选择你的想法

3289
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:06,000
你不会写下你所有的想法 因为你做不到 所以你必须立即选择 那就是编辑

3290
02:08:06,633 --> 02:08:12,666
然后当你实际技术性地编辑你所写的内容时 同样的事情发生了 你缩小它 你组织它 你使其连贯

3291
02:08:12,733 --> 02:08:18,933
你去除无关的内容 所以这会让你的思考更紧凑 然后如果你在和某人讨论你的想法时

3292
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:22,100
同样的事情发生了 因为他们会反对或他们会奖励其中的一些

3293
02:08:22,333 --> 02:08:26,700
所以那就是所有的对话 有些是新想法的生成

3294
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:34,033
但大量的是编辑 你已经以一种非常模糊、类似梦境的方式向自己揭示的东西

3295
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,333
在我们结束之前你还有什么想说的吗

3296
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:45,000
我想感谢所有观看和聆听的人们 也感谢你和你的团队让这成为可能

3297
02:08:45,133 --> 02:08:46,366
我是说 你们知道

3298
02:08:46,533 --> 02:08:51,866
你们付出了很多努力 从英国带着你的团队过来 你们专业地设置了这一切 而且

3299
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,333
这是一个直接的采访 没有任何技巧 而且

3300
02:08:57,533 --> 02:09:02,333
所以这不是一件容易的事情 我很感激这个机会 就这些了

3301
