1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,739
Listen, I'm dreaming of having sex with you.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,218
You don't have to argue, you shouldn't torture people.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,618
The faith realizes itself through knowing it and avoiding it.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,279
I don't believe in going deep into your inner self.

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,879
You should always ask yourself what other options failed so that this could have happened.

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,199
Freedom has to be grounded in a complex set of unwritten rules.

7
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,138
I don't make a compromise here.

8
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,002
I want this passionate love.

9
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:19,639
The paradox which applies to us today, I think, unfortunately, is that what if we are dealing with a fate, destiny or determinism, which realizes itself only through being known.

10
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:21,178
I'm a pessimist.

11
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,457
I think this is happening today in a perverted way.

12
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:35,434
We hear all the time about, you know, global warming, threat, and it's all a perverted game that the more we know about it the more we are entering it.

13
00:01:35,434 --> 00:01:44,539
You know which story I and at the end I have in my mind you know that wonderful old story about appointment in Samara you find it in

14
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:54,633
Somerset Maugham some other writers it's a wonderful story a servant on an errand in the busy market in Baghdad meets death,

15
00:01:54,657 --> 00:02:08,657
he is terrified by death's gaze and runs to his master and says give me a horse, I will ride day and night to reach Samarra in the north of Iraq where death will not find me.

16
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,895
The good master provides to servant a horse and goes himself to the market, finds death and shouts at death.

17
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,036
How could you do this to my faithful servant?

18
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,917
You know what the death answers?

19
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,651
You must know.

20
00:02:22,462 --> 00:02:25,537
No, my gaze was not a threat.

21
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,196
My gaze was a look at surprise.

22
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,515
What is the guy doing here when tomorrow I have an appointment with him in Samara?

23
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,738
But don't you know that it's the same with Oedipus' story, our founding myth.

24
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:48,559
Oedipus, you remember, Oedipus realized itself only through prediction.

25
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:59,069
What would have been the wise thing of Oedipus' parents where they were told your son will screw you mother and before that kill you.

26
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:05,106
It will say fuck off we don't take it seriously and everything would have been happy.

27
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:10,239
The faith realized itself through knowing it and avoiding it.

28
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,047
That's our predicament today.

29
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:30,643
It's a very tragic one that knowing it not only doesn't help but precisely through knowing what awaits us and the wrong way to react to it we fall even more deeply into it.

30
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:36,139
Certain things are accepted in a good sense dogmatically

31
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:50,277
like I would like to live in a society like this where you don't have to argue you shouldn't torture people women shouldn't be raped, if you need to argue for it, it's already,

32
00:03:50,301 --> 00:03:53,078
you are already losing something.

33
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,537
This is why what horrified me is that,

34
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,976
although, who did this, Dick Cheney or who and then Trump,

35
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,358
you remember how some 10, 15 years ago when, all of a sudden, torture became a topic of debate.

36
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,857
Maybe if we do it in the soft way, water, blah, blah, blah,

37
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,938
And even if the majority was opposed to it,

38
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,618
this was even more horrible.

39
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,796
It became a topic of debate.

40
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,574
Not to mention rape, who was, I always forget his name, she's not my best friend.

41
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,877
Some American senator who claimed there is no rape.

42
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,377
The moment we debate for it, we are lost.

43
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,120
Just the last thing, when we talk about objective research,

44
00:04:39,806 --> 00:04:49,497
objective research, I still think that here, this is philosophical problematic maybe to you and to you.

45
00:04:50,080 --> 00:05:11,258
We should, what horrifies me most is examples when factual truth about just what is really out there serves as clearly an instrument of something we don't agree with, like racism and so on.

46
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,560
Like an example, if I were to be a pro neo-Nazi German,

47
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:26,659
I guarantee you that I could write a book full of facts, only facts, where I say, wait a minute, it's not so simple.

48
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:34,693
Look at the statistic, 60% of journalists in early 30s were Jews and so on and so on.

49
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:44,719
So the true question here when we fight antisemitism is not the question of objectivity.

50
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,417
Are facts really like that?

51
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,057
The way antisemite describes them.

52
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:57,639
My point is the moment you accept this as a topic of a debate, you sold your soul to the devil

53
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:05,436
because the question is not are Jews or Palestinians today, whoever, are really like that?

54
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:16,838
The true question is why do the Nazis need the image of the Jew, the antisemitic image of the Jew to sustain their world view?

55
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,260
So there is some, that is for me the tragedy.

56
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:29,658
The most dangerous propaganda for something which is obviously ethically reprehensible

57
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,437
is the propaganda which at the level of facts

58
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,035
can be can be mostly truthful.

59
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:46,300
We effectively are in an era of cynicism as a form of ideology.

60
00:06:47,503 --> 00:07:01,595
It not only doesn't matter if you take your official ideology seriously or not, that's the beautiful paradox that I learned from my communist past, I mean, living in communist Yugoslavia.

61
00:07:02,525 --> 00:07:04,218
it was a beautiful paradox.

62
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:08,716
You know, we had an official ideology, self-management, socialism, and so on and so on.

63
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:20,980
But if you took the official ideology too seriously, you were in danger of being treated as a dissident and you were perceived as a danger to those in power.

64
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:29,519
So an ideology functioned in such a way that you were expected not to take it seriously.

65
00:07:30,002 --> 00:07:34,236
It wasn't only that it didn't matter if you take it seriously.

66
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,619
You had to not take it seriously.

67
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:39,077
It's a beautiful example.

68
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,434
And this is how it is today with Trump and so on, all of them.

69
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:53,100
And this is, again, the most dangerous moment when ideology appears as just neutral common sense.

70
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,059
You know, like forget big ideologies, go to actual problems and so on.

71
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:00,776
oh, ideology begins here.

72
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,319
What do we perceive as an actual problem?

73
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,500
Ideology is already in the definition of problems.

74
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:22,079
That's why for me, the first task in critique of ideology is not to claim, okay, we have problems, we must approach them in this or that way,

75
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,818
but is this really a problem?

76
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:26,557
An example of this ideology.

77
00:08:27,022 --> 00:08:32,775
Did you notice how in the last decade or two, racism, sexism, especially racism,

78
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:38,939
are usually formulated in the terms of tolerance.

79
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:46,418
You know, we should tolerate, but this is for me already an ideological move, a proof.

80
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:53,036
Go, I did it through the speeches, texts, whatever he wrote of Martin Luther King.

81
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,478
He never uses practically the word tolerance.

82
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,100
His complaint is not, wives don't tolerate us, we should tolerate each other more.

83
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:08,456
No, his point is different legal system, social rights, economic justice, and so on and so on.

84
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:19,460
The whole notion of tolerance as a main problem changes the entire field so that it becomes a cultural problem.

85
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,339
You know, this is what those in power like.

86
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:24,699
Even a false form of psychoanalysis enters here.

87
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:31,179
Like if I'm intolerant towards you, then this means I have psychic problems.

88
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:35,797
I should analyze myself, what is wrong and so on and so on.

89
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:41,598
No wonder that you remember when Mel Gibson made an antisemitic outburst,

90
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,616
you know what was his excuse?

91
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:46,336
I will search a hell of a psychiatrist.

92
00:09:47,081 --> 00:09:50,199
No, sorry, antisemitism is not a psychic problem.

93
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,897
It's a material social force.

94
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:59,018
it involves a certain way to deal with the Jews and with others and so on and so on.

95
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:11,136
So again, here I follow Louis Altisser only at this point that never forget that ideology is a material force

96
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:20,600
in the sense that even if it's factually wrong like antisemitism or anti-Palestinian racism and so on,

97
00:10:21,161 --> 00:10:33,600
The point is not are they right or wrong, of course they are wrong, but the point is how they structure our political social reality, how they are enacted.

98
00:10:34,544 --> 00:10:37,696
And that's really difficult to change.

99
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:54,540
Evil, we humans are masters in justifying horrible acts by constructing a narrative which makes them acceptable.

100
00:10:55,324 --> 00:10:58,158
Stalinists were masters indeed and others.

101
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,057
Here I would like to return to Hannah Arendt whom is you.

102
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:12,974
In a crucial text, early one I think, she draws a wonderful difference between SA, the early Nazi tax and SS.

103
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:23,309
She said SA, those who were purged in 1934, were vulgar brutal evil, raping, beating and so on.

104
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,198
With SS you get something much more horrifying.

105
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,438
You get this cold impersonal bureaucratic evil.

106
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,738
They don't have this type of passions and so on and so on.

107
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:50,219
In this sense I claim that I would nonetheless be ready to talk with all reservations about – just two points to finish – about first social forms of evil.

108
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,197
Let me take an extreme example.

109
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,018
It's really depressing, even if you check it just on Wikipedia.

110
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,286
The Opium War, 1842-4, against China.

111
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:09,657
I'm very close to say this was evil, because you cannot imagine what it did to China.

112
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:21,978
1820, China had a functioning system against hunger and drought, its economy was not per capita but absolutely three times stronger than British and so on.

113
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,638
Then they did it on behalf of the notion of good and civilization.

114
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:37,260
They prohibited import of opium and the Western justification was that free trade is the condition of civilization.

115
00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:43,659
It's our duty, not only right, to invade China, to force it to be civilized.

116
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:54,358
When I'm in Mexico or in the United States I said, why don't you do this and Mexican and Columbia cartels declare war on the United States because they are prohibited.

117
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,038
But you see, what I'm saying, you cannot simply say they were bad.

118
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:05,218
This was the dark side of the liberal market system itself then.

119
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,819
Don't talk about liberal capital.

120
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:16,116
And you have here across the sea, even almost the worst problem, you know that Ireland, the potato famine.

121
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,656
You know, Ireland was all that time even exporting wheat and so on.

122
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,239
They believed that to...

123
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,416
Okay, so you got my point.

124
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,031
The last point, very last.

125
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,159
You know, when we are talking about ignoring evil and so on,

126
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,460
aren't we today approaching something much more horrifying?

127
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:48,856
We learned how to say, describe correctly things but in a way that doesn't engage us.

128
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,860
Like my example, it was disgusting.

129
00:13:52,022 --> 00:13:53,557
I would plant a bomb very stable.

130
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,458
Remember two years ago, the Glasgow Conference on Global Warming?

131
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,378
It was all very ethical, even basically correct insights.

132
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,619
But the very forum precluded us to do something.

133
00:14:07,503 --> 00:14:11,037
Sorry, just one sentence, literally, with a couple of commas and so on.

134
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:14,119
That is, for me, the problem.

135
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:16,257
Give me the last example, I already mentioned it.

136
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:20,259
I shaped all those big biennales, Venice Castle.

137
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,118
Their justification is pure anti-capitalism.

138
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:27,518
We are all exploited by capital, colonialist, blah, blah.

139
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:34,934
And they declare this, and nonetheless, these biennales work in a perfect way as part of capitalist.

140
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,139
So, you know, the tragedy today is you can say the truth,

141
00:14:40,642 --> 00:14:42,439
But it doesn't awaken us.

142
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:53,399
There is, for me, a strange psychological fact that often you cannot say something in reality,

143
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,616
but if it's put in the terms of a game, even theater play, you can do it.

144
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,772
For example, the great classic Jane Austen's Mansfield Park.

145
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,915
A young couple is in love, they are too constrained to say this openly.

146
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:18,980
But they select Shakespeare piece, I think, where they in the game, but they can say it.

147
00:15:19,781 --> 00:15:21,479
So this is what Jacques Lacombe meant.

148
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:27,418
I think when he says this, that the truth has the structure of a fiction.

149
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:34,296
And I deeply believe that in this sense, masks are never just masks.

150
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,577
When we adopt a mask to play a game,

151
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:46,800
We can bring out there something that we are not ready to confront in our so-called, in our so-called real life.

152
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,119
In this sense also, let me give you another example.

153
00:15:53,260 --> 00:16:02,255
I'm ashamed to mention it, it's so stupid, but you saw for weddings and the funeral that moment when Hugh Grant declares love.

154
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:12,977
You see, he does it in the sense of, you know, he's stuttering, repeating himself,

155
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:20,255
but precisely through this apparent breakdown of the game, he gets his message through.

156
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:26,796
Sometimes the failed game is the only way to get the message through.

157
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,479
That's why, incidentally, I hate male chauvinists

158
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:37,878
When a woman reports to be raped, they say, but you see, she contradicted herself and so on.

159
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:46,819
Sorry, but I would be very distrustful if a woman were to give totally perfect cold report on.

160
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,099
Okay, I wouldn't discard it, but you know what I think?

161
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:59,257
Sometimes the truth can only articulate it through failures and so on and so on.

162
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,038
So the last thing, I want to emphasize this.

163
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,320
I don't believe in going deep into your inner self.

164
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:17,074
Sorry to be brutal, if you go deep into it, you find deep shit there, I claim.

165
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,975
Monsterous fantasies and so on.

166
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:30,439
I believe that the only way to overcome yourself to overcome yourself is to identify with your mask.

167
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,777
Just to conclude, and I don't drag on,

168
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,320
my favorite movie here, Rossellini, you should see it.

169
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,575
You can get it on YouTube.

170
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:47,538
From 1960, I think, with Toria De Sica, with Toria, General Della Rovere.

171
00:17:49,661 --> 00:17:53,079
De Sica plays a poor guy who is caught,

172
00:17:53,360 --> 00:18:04,139
it's still occupied Italy, caught by the Nazis, and since he looks exactly like General della Rovere, a big name of resistance, they tell him,

173
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:13,177
we killed della Rovere, but resistance that we have in prison don't know this, so go there, pretend that you are General della Rovere,

174
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,238
and people will confide in you and you will tell us that.

175
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,057
You can guess what is the ending.

176
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,399
He identifies so much to his role that he is ready to die.

177
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:31,317
He doesn't say anything that he's shot publicly as General Della Rovere.

178
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,798
In this sense, I am for good alienation.

179
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,058
Who cares about his real self, a poor beggar, and so on.

180
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:45,817
In this complete identification with another, you can find freedom, but also horror.

181
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,558
Did you see with Jim Carrey, his best film, I think,

182
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,272
Did you see the mask?

183
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,158
Where he's completely free, but nightmare comes out.

184
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:03,859
This complete freedom to do what you want, he experiences it as a nightmare.

185
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,538
So in this more precise sense,

186
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:14,458
I think that first there is something liberating in games and cliches.

187
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:28,218
Can you imagine how horrible life would have been if you were to tell just the truth sincerely without hypocrisy, there is no life without hypocrisy.

188
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,396
Here, I would warn also against, I wonder if you would agree, another extremism.

189
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,298
Extremism of so-called deep ecology.

190
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,077
Let's avoid misunderstanding.

191
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:50,058
Not in this keep sense, they go too far, we cannot abandon everything and so on.

192
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:59,218
But I found hidden in their line of argumentation an extreme anthropocentrism.

193
00:19:59,600 --> 00:19:59,887
Where?

194
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,874
You know how they argue.

195
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,654
They argue like this.

196
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,337
Not only humans have rights.

197
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,558
We live on Earth, we are just one among the species.

198
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,548
Who said this, sorry?

199
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,277
So-called deep ecologists.

200
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,755
Deep ecologist, okay, sorry, yes.

201
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,680
The idea is this one that we have to learn modesty.

202
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,555
We have to learn that we are just one among the living species.

203
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:36,859
So we have to take care also of the well-being, they get here ambiguous, of all other parts of nature,

204
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:46,536
not only animals, not only plants, but even they speak about the rights of rivers, of beautiful mountains and so on and so on.

205
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,477
But now, back to what Yuval said, and I agree with him,

206
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:57,279
but they, animals, okay, animals at least make sounds which signal their suffering.

207
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,079
But rivers, mountains, whatever, they don't know

208
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,198
they have rights because in some sense they don't know anything.

209
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:24,158
So what deep ecology means is that beneath this false modesty, we are just among the species, that we are really the universal beings,

210
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,978
the one who should be responsible for everything.

211
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:38,580
Here, it's hidden another potential of how we humans should really control the Earth.

212
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:50,938
And then you get to all those plans which are often masked as progressively ecological, like to put more carbon monoxide in the air to prevent.

213
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:58,158
But I would agree with Yuval, nature is so unpredictable here.

214
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,718
We never know what can the secondary non-intended consequences be.

215
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:09,917
So yes, we should be radical ecologists, but always be aware of this,

216
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,759
that the long-term consequences can run against.

217
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,879
That's why, immediately I give him the word, that's why I am a Hegelian today.

218
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,177
I think the formula today should be back from Marx to Hegel.

219
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,317
Marx still had a plan.

220
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,198
If we do this, this, this, there will be at least a substantially better society.

221
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,976
Hegel is not doing this.

222
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:42,839
You know what Hegel says in his most quoted, but people don't take it seriously, introduction to Recht's philosophy, to philosophy of right.

223
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:51,417
He said, thought, philosophy, can only grasp the present order when it begins to disintegrate.

224
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,319
And future, we cannot say anything.

225
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:59,699
We have to be extremely careful about the future.

226
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,318
What this practical means, it's not pacifism,

227
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:06,578
let's do whatever we want, we don't know what will happen.

228
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,956
No, it's just that, you know where is Hegel at his best?

229
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,617
In the spirit of what Yuval said.

230
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:24,740
When she takes an extreme idea and demonstrates how unexpectedly in actuality it turns into its opposite.

231
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,997
For Hegel, the classical example, I think even he exaggerates there.

232
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:34,340
But French Revolution, freedom, uh-uh, you get terror.

233
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,996
The second half of 20th of 19th century, it was in Europe, not elsewhere,

234
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:48,098
relative period of half a century of column, progress, women's rights, you get World War One.

235
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:56,419
Soviet Union, October Revolution, whatever you think, an attempt at emancipation, you get Stalinism.

236
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:04,878
The last example, Fukuyama happy 90s, end of history, and so on, ha ha, we are now where we are.

237
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:21,039
So, my basic approach would be, beware that, as a rule, when you are making big plans, things will always, in some sense, go wrong, and try to take this into account.

238
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,805
Do we really want what we think that we want?

239
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:41,434
Quite often what appears as an obstacle to getting what we want is really what sustains our desire.

240
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:48,539
For example, I read years ago, I remember this, a biography of TS Eliot.

241
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,298
You know, while his wife was, it's not clear, did she put her there?

242
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,858
Was it really in a psychiatric hospital?

243
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,656
She had a distant affair, it's only letters, it seems, with another lady.

244
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,219
And all the letters were, their letters were,

245
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:14,198
oh, let's just wait for the moment when my wife will die, then we will be able to be together.

246
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,192
You know what happened?

247
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,098
When the wife died, they split also.

248
00:25:19,823 --> 00:25:23,980
And I think this is a general structure of our desire.

249
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,839
Did you see maybe the Francois Truffaut film?

250
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,055
It's old, you are too young to see it.

251
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,636
Day for Night, La Nuit American.

252
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,497
There is a wonderful marginal scene there that I love.

253
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:42,716
A guy, one of the cast, wants to seduce another script girl, whatever, I don't know.

254
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,374
So their car breaks down.

255
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,056
They go to a lake close to the road.

256
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,578
And then the guy tells her, listen,

257
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:56,358
I'm dreaming of having sex with you for days all the time here.

258
00:25:56,701 --> 00:25:57,597
Now we are alone.

259
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,517
Nobody knows that we are here.

260
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,594
Why don't we quickly do it?

261
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,894
You know what the woman does?

262
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,239
She said, okay, why not?

263
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,659
And started to pull his trousers down, her trousers down.

264
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,698
And she is totally shocked.

265
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,290
What do you mean?

266
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,716
Just like that or whatever and so on.

267
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,280
So I think that this logic of detour and so on

268
00:26:23,406 --> 00:26:26,338
is part of our sexual games.

269
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,997
You cannot go directly for it.

270
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,337
It's very difficult.

271
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,839
That's why Lacan characterizes the ethical position in psychoanalysis as do not betray your desire.

272
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:45,277
Usually we do betray it.

273
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,496
For example, it happened to me, a dirty detail, not problematic, don't be afraid.

274
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,676
When I was young, I was in love with a girl.

275
00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:02,877
The link was that the girl had a father who was a philosopher and the ritual was to arrive at her apartment,

276
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:09,516
first have a talk with her father, and then let's go out to her.

277
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,795
But at a certain point she dropped me because she said, I got it.

278
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,319
What you really want is the surplus enjoyment.

279
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,338
I really, it was the other way around from what it looked.

280
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,953
It was not, father is just the detour.

281
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,639
She told me, I was a detour for you.

282
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,556
What you really enjoy is this.

283
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,956
Let's call it intellectual foreplay, talking with her father.

284
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:43,657
He has a wonderful, he, sorry, Darian leader, your great Lacanian, who also writes good books.

285
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,557
has a wonderful example in one of his early books,

286
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:53,018
where he mentions a case that allegedly happened to him.

287
00:27:53,700 --> 00:28:07,277
A patient came to him and said, yesterday I invited the lady out, and I wanted to, of course, we went to a hotel with a good restaurant.

288
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:13,357
The idea was we have a nice meal, and then I take her up to a room.

289
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,237
But he said he made a terrifying slip of tongue.

290
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:24,558
When entering the restaurant, he said to the waiter, a bed for two please, instead of a table for two.

291
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,278
And Darien leader does something wonderful.

292
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,299
He said, how to read this slip, slip of tongue.

293
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:38,399
It's not as you would have thought, he was already thinking about sex later.

294
00:28:38,761 --> 00:28:40,377
It's quite the opposite.

295
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,058
He was afraid that he will enjoy eating there too much,

296
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:50,199
and he will lose the will to even go upstairs later.

297
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,515
So it was a reminder to himself, don't enjoy this too much.

298
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:04,338
So again, what I am saying here is that the lesson of all these reversals and so on

299
00:29:04,881 --> 00:29:06,476
is a very simple one.

300
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,610
It's that we enjoy. There is no enjoyment in directly attaining the goal.

301
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,237
There is no enjoyment in directly attaining the goal.

302
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,297
It's like falling in love, again, I'm sorry.

303
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:24,597
You walk on the street, sorry for the tasteless example, but not vulgar, you sleep on a banana peel,

304
00:29:25,421 --> 00:29:30,957
a lady helps you to get up, maybe you discover it's the love of your life.

305
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,937
So although you know well it was a pure contingency,

306
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:46,537
but the way you experience it, all your life, if you are a romantic like I am, you are waiting for that moment. We have to live with this contradiction.

308
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,175
So philosophy is like falling in love?

309
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:51,820
Absolutely, absolutely.

310
00:29:51,880 --> 00:30:02,098
I think philosophy is falling in love in the sense that it's, you know what Harari, I would have many things to debate with him,

311
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:14,813
but there I sincerely agreed with him, where he said, freedom is never a conclusive state, now I am free.

312
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:20,656
Freedom is the very eternal doubt, am I free or not, and so on.

313
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,937
And I think it's the same with love.

314
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:32,115
The moment you don't doubt your love, the moment you think you know why you are in love, it's finished.

315
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,030
So they both have this retro activity.

316
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,978
And what I find it so sad today, I hate it.

317
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,477
My French friend Alain, but you pointed this out.

318
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:55,277
In English and in French and in some other languages, not in all, the verb, a very correct one, which he uses to fall in love.

319
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,580
And one should give to the verb fall all this radicality.

320
00:31:01,082 --> 00:31:03,917
You go, all of a sudden, boom, you fall.

321
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:13,777
What I hate so much, I don't believe it, I'm here all metaphysician with this idea, but I have different needs.

322
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:19,036
Maybe polyamory works, you are good for this, you are good for that.

323
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:21,077
No, sorry, this is not love.

324
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,177
This is your different needs and so on.

325
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:26,497
Love is something else.

326
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:29,438
It's much more non-conditional.

327
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:46,758
And what I fear is that, you know, when I was young, there was a more conservative erotic pedagogy to be, to have multiple partners was considered pathological.

328
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:54,436
Even psychoanalysts were usually, what are you, why are you running, if you are a man, sorry for the male chauvinist, and heterosexual,

330
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,976
why are you running from one woman to another?

331
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,197
What are you escaping from, your mother or what?

332
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:06,256
Now in Argentina, maybe the most psychoanalyzed country in the world, when I was there,

333
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:11,074
they told me, and I find this sad, the cadets, that it's the opposite.

334
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:17,997
If you jump from one woman to the other, for women also, if you change partners,

335
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:20,096
it's considered normal.

336
00:32:20,581 --> 00:32:26,119
If you are faithful to your partner, they say, oh my god, this is pathological fixation,

337
00:32:26,421 --> 00:32:28,417
We have to analyze it and so on.

338
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:32,258
I think beneath this, it's not just liberation.

339
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,418
No, it's a sad redefinition of love in the term of your needs.

340
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:44,177
Maybe you need more of this, more of that, and then maybe only different people can do it.

341
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:45,734
This is not love.

342
00:32:46,301 --> 00:32:48,757
I don't make a compromise here.

343
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:51,658
I want this passionate love,

344
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,556
But you know where I'm not romanticist?

345
00:32:57,745 --> 00:33:01,380
I understand Orpheus and Eurydice.

346
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:08,558
You may or may not know it, but the German cultural critic, he is now old, 30 years ago, Klaus Tabelite,

347
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:19,976
provided a wonderful interpretation of why does bringing her up from underworld, why does Orpheus look back?

348
00:33:20,661 --> 00:33:25,037
It's not that because he was worried, you read this and made some sounds, he was worried.

349
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,937
The idea is that while she was following him and he was prohibited to look at her back,

350
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,137
when she was following him up by divine grace,

351
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,617
she started to ask serious question like, okay, she's my ideal, but wait a minute,

352
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:46,697
to live with this woman who will wash the dishes, all that stuff, what if I get disappointed?

353
00:33:47,160 --> 00:34:00,438
Isn't it better to get rid of her and I retain her as an ideal, I write poems, but I can do what I want with other women, so she looked back, bye bye,

354
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:04,556
I will celebrate you all my life, but I will be rid of you.

355
00:34:05,141 --> 00:34:06,737
That's not true love.

356
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:13,597
True love is that, true love, Lacan says this somewhere, doesn't idealize the partner.

357
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,675
True love is not idealization.

358
00:34:16,381 --> 00:34:24,519
you expect all the small imperfections and you love the person even more because of this.

359
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,457
Yes, of course, I agree that,

360
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,895
and this is for me the great tragedy of the 20th century,

361
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,414
that not only the fascist right, but the radical left also,

362
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:49,235
when it came to power, enacted new forms even of terror of unfreedom and so on and so on.

363
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:55,638
And I consider totally legitimate the question of how this was possible.

364
00:34:56,161 --> 00:35:03,956
I don't buy the stories, everything was okay in the Soviet Union then unfortunately Stalin took over and everything went wrong.

365
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:11,796
But so in what sense I do remain a leftist who advocates freedom.

366
00:35:12,521 --> 00:35:24,060
My basic point, and even some conservatives, who I got would agree, I hope, with me, is that freedom has to have a material base.

367
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:34,358
I don't mean this vulgar Marxist way of this, but simply, okay, you are free, but to exercise that freedom,

368
00:35:34,881 --> 00:35:39,860
you always, that's the paradox of freedom, have to obey certain rules.

369
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,866
most metaphilic example.

370
00:35:41,866 --> 00:35:46,240
We are free in our thoughts, but to freely think, articulate what

371
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:52,575
we want, we have to perfectly master the rules of language.

372
00:35:52,575 --> 00:35:58,652
I don't want to live in a situation where I have to learn or invent the rules again and again.

373
00:35:58,652 --> 00:36:05,009
Obeying the rules of language is the basis of freedom to think.

374
00:36:05,009 --> 00:36:09,440
Then also, of course, we have to extend this on the social level.

375
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:21,258
In order for us to feel or enact freely, there are so many things at the level of what German calls ziten, customs.

376
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:30,335
Like you walk along the street, you should be relatively sure that others will also obey the same rules of politeness and so on and so on.

377
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:34,878
Then I can move further, of course, to the social economic domain,

378
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,917
how state agencies function and so on and so on.

379
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:43,340
And here, I agree with the point made by the last speaker

380
00:36:45,800 --> 00:37:01,300
that we shouldn't get too focused on what I would have called the explicit ideological stances, freedom and so on and so on look at the material practice.

381
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:08,858
The examples mentioned of actual unfreedom are for me precisely examples of,

382
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:16,698
and this is for me crucial in debates today, what Hegel called zitum, mos, castums,

383
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:25,817
which are not just explicit rules, but the implicit rules which tell us how to act in a certain situation.

384
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:31,739
We can have formal freedom, but you in the UK have MI6, other mechanisms

385
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:38,775
which the fact of underprivileged or exclude or exclude other people.

386
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:46,517
This is what for me, the reality of ideology of ideological exclusions and so on and so on.

387
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:55,919
Freedom has to be grounded in a complex set of unwritten rules which are acceptable.

388
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:01,598
Look, the first thing about video games is that their universe is incomplete.

389
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:12,476
You're in a game, stupid game, where you are shooting, fighting on the main street of a small town, let us say, and in the back you see forest with trees.

390
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:20,316
But it's not part of the game that you can approach those trees and see them in detail.

391
00:38:21,262 --> 00:38:27,379
It's part of the game that you cannot go there, so the programmer say, why lose time on that programming?

392
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,814
Let's leave it open.

393
00:38:29,421 --> 00:38:35,955
And the way, I got this from a popular introduction to philosophy, sorry, forgot the name, but very intelligently, I think, written.

394
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,017
The guy says, is not quantum physics, does it not have the same lesson?

395
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:48,938
When God was programming the universe, he said people are too stupid to reach beyond the atom.

396
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,579
So why should I bother their programming?

397
00:38:51,841 --> 00:38:53,377
He lived it undetermined.

398
00:38:53,741 --> 00:39:01,257
And we were a little bit too bright for God, and we, as you say in English, caught God with his pants down, as it were.

399
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,086
You know?

400
00:39:02,761 --> 00:39:06,659
Do you then believe, then, or are you positing in terms of that argument?

401
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:13,540
So are you saying, or maybe it's not possible, within quantum physics this question, is reality discrete or continuous?

402
00:39:13,661 --> 00:39:17,317
So is reality like Minecraft, where you kind of zoom in further and further and further,

403
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:23,699
and then you get, as you say, down further, further to these tiny little, you know, to the leptons, and further and further down.

404
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,820
Is that not your sympathetic view?

405
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,417
spontaneously, but I don't have any empirical ground for this.

406
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:32,818
I am for discrete nature in mod sense.

407
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:38,876
And I think this is almost maybe the lesson of quantum physics, but I'm very much speculating now.

408
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,460
I think that it's not this endless divisibility.

409
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,096
You can further split that.

410
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:52,916
At a certain point, you can come to the, I can split this in half, this and that, this and that.

411
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:59,735
But I believe when you approach the zero point, the division is between something and nothing.

412
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,418
You see, you get something, its counterpoint is void, is nothing.

413
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:12,956
And so I'm not saying this is bad metaphysical reading of what, that in this freedom is grounded.

414
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:16,118
No, freedom is not contingency.

415
00:40:18,141 --> 00:40:24,858
It's not my free act if I, but even this is not, of course, it's deterministic, but let's say for me it's a contingency.

416
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:30,119
If to make a decision I throw a coin up and said hat tail or whatever.

417
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,658
No, that's contingency from my view, really it's not.

418
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,239
But freedom is a necessity of its own.

419
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:40,597
Freedom is a positive decision that you do.

420
00:40:41,381 --> 00:40:44,596
Is this only, as they say, user's illusion?

421
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:47,378
I think not.

422
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,658
I think we have to, it's more important than ever,

423
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:56,736
We have to accept this ontological openness of nature already, of history.

424
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,579
For example, we are now in an open situation.

425
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,899
And retroactively, it will become necessary.

426
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:10,216
If there will be a world war, if there will be people who will survive it,

427
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:15,511
they will tell the story of how it was all pointed towards this war.

428
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:17,874
We were doomed.

429
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:23,538
If there will not be a war, they will say, oh, it was like Cold War, false alarms, and so on.

430
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,939
What I'm claiming is that these are not simply illusions.

431
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,279
The situation is genuinely open.

432
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:45,071
And another lesson, which I know it's not legitimate, I applied too quickly from quantum physics to humanities nonetheless, is that to understand something, a historical event, you should read it

433
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,957
in a superposition with other possible events.

434
00:41:51,620 --> 00:42:02,797
When something happens, you should always ask yourself what other options failed so that this could have happened.

435
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:09,598
First, as you, Rupert, nicely deployed, yes, I would go even a step further.

436
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,339
The usual idea of materialism is small.

437
00:42:14,661 --> 00:42:24,457
Somewhere in empty space, there are just small bits of matter and they somehow chaotically mix and everything comes out of that.

438
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:27,536
My type of materialism would have been,

439
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,397
I called it that.

440
00:42:29,721 --> 00:42:37,095
Materialism without matter, I take the lesson of, as far as I'm able to understand them, of quantum physics and so on.

441
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:49,756
And I claim we should not get fixed on a certain figure of matter, this mechanistic idea, you know, like little billiard balls, whatever, encountering each other.

442
00:42:51,601 --> 00:42:53,698
Reality can be totally abstract.

443
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,839
It can be immaterial waves, whatever we call it.

444
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:13,539
What makes it eight days for me, and this is the crucial point, is that it's not run by an overreaching intelligence or whatever, that it's basically blind, a blind process.

445
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,685
not mechanist.

446
00:43:15,685 --> 00:43:21,240
It's a blind process, but for me, so-called reality, we can debate what it is,

447
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:27,194
is as I often develop, open ontologically non constituted.

448
00:43:27,194 --> 00:43:34,698
That's why I totally oppose those readings of quantum physics, which see a kind of hidden idealism in it.

450
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:41,560
You know, ah the role of observation, this means that reality is somehow constituted through our

451
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:49,538
No, Niels Bohr, Richard was to the end, not a religious guy, but again, this idea of,

452
00:43:50,601 --> 00:44:00,639
I think changes enough This idea of reality as ontologically incomplete that we get even in itself, incomplete universe.

454
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:15,179
And at the same time, very important, the growing exploding gap between what science presents us as reality and our ordinary everyday experience of reality.

455
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,136
Look at classic Greek thought, Aristotle.

456
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:26,099
He basically constructs an ontology out of our ordinary daily experience of reality.

458
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,615
You know, heavy objects fall down, up, the sky and so on.

459
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:38,499
But already with Galileo, this image becomes counterintuitive, then Einstein, then quantum physics.

460
00:44:40,021 --> 00:44:40,693
Yes, it is.

461
00:44:41,121 --> 00:44:42,017
I mean, wrap up.

462
00:44:42,261 --> 00:44:43,678
So that's the first thing.

463
00:44:44,001 --> 00:45:02,136
So this is the problem that I shared even with some people like Hawking whose thesis is that the time of philosophy is over, science took, science is now replacing it.

464
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,379
not only religion, but even philosophy.

465
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,137
Science is taking it over.

466
00:45:09,502 --> 00:45:09,994
It's true.

467
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,853
It's very interesting observation

468
00:45:12,801 --> 00:45:14,429
that in the last decade,

469
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:24,200
we were trained to even look for the solution of one's metaphysical question in science.

470
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:27,938
If you are today interested, is our world finite or infinite?

471
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,559
We look into quantum cosmology, not to metaphysics.

472
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,877
If you want to know we have a free will or not,

473
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,156
you ask cognitive scientists and so on and so on.

474
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,558
But I think, okay, I will explain it later to wrap up.

475
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:50,179
I think that there is a dimension of reflexive thinking, which remains a domain of philosophy.

476
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,737
I'm more of a philosopher here.

477
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:57,217
And which for structural reasons cannot be covered up by science.

478
00:45:57,681 --> 00:46:06,899
And point two on this, would especially like to insist we should be very careful about what do we mean by beliefs.

479
00:46:06,899 --> 00:46:21,120
Today we have not only beliefs which we publicly profess but secretly don't take seriously, we also have things that we publicly mock but we act as if we believe in them.

480
00:46:21,941 --> 00:46:28,160
To conclude one line, literally don't be mad at me, with my favorite, you must know it most of you,

481
00:46:28,783 --> 00:46:31,959
The joke idea attributed to me is Bohr.

482
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:41,979
You know, a friend of him saw at the entrance to his house a horse shoe, a superstitious item preventing evil spirits from entering the house.

483
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:42,936
And the friend asked him,

484
00:46:43,402 --> 00:46:45,160
OK, but you are an 8-day scientist.

485
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,160
Why do you hope that about the entrance to your house?

486
00:46:48,402 --> 00:46:51,160
Bohr answered, I know I don't believe in it.

487
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:56,060
I'm a scientist, but I was told it works even if you don't believe in it.

488
00:46:56,466 --> 00:46:57,140
That's our attitude.
