1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,366
If you want to know something about yourself, sit on your bed one night and say,

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,366
如果你想了解自己的一些事情 那就在某个晚上 坐在你自己的床上 跟自己说

3
00:00:03,633 --> 00:00:10,700
what's one thing I'm doing wrong, that I know I'm doing wrong, that I could fix, that I would fix.

4
00:00:03,633 --> 00:00:10,700
我正在做错的那件事是什么 我知道我在做错什么 我能改正 我想改正

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,466
You meditate on that, you'll get an answer.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,466
你对此进行沉思 你会得到一个答案

7
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:16,966
And it won't be one you want, but it'll be the necessary one.

8
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:16,966
这个答案可能不是你想要的那个 但它是必要的那个

9
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:20,233
When you're trapped, some of it's your own inadequacy.

10
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:20,233
当你陷入困境 一部分原因是因为你自己的不足

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:29,133
What you can do to begin with is every bloody thing you possibly can do to put yourself in the most virtuous and powerful negotiating position possible.

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:29,133
首先你能做的是尽你所能做的一切 让自己处于最有德性（最有利）和最有力的谈判位置

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
Wherever I go in the world, people come up to me and they often have a pretty rough story to relate.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
无论我走到世界哪里 人们都会向我走来 他们经常有一些相当艰难的故事要讲

15
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:41,700
It's an awful thing because you see, even in the revelation of their triumph, the initial depth of their despair.

16
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:41,700
这是一件可怕的事情 因为即使在他们胜利的喜悦中 你也能看到他们最初的绝望之深

17
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:47,366
So I wouldn't change that.

18
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:47,366
所以我无法改变那一点

19
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,500
But it's not nothing.

20
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,533
但这并非无关紧要（虚无）

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,200
它肯定不仅仅是幸福

22
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,266
It's certainly not just happiness.

23
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:56,100
It's better than happiness. But it's almost unbearable.

24
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,233
它比幸福更好 但它几乎难以承受

25
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,000
Quick one.

26
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:08,466

00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:09,233
如果你在听这个并且点击了订阅按钮 无论你在哪里听这个播客 非常感谢你

28
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:09,233
Thank you so much.

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,600
（这是）你们一直在等待的对话

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,600
The conversation you guys have been waiting for.

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,900
我这么说是因为自从我宣布乔丹·彼得森来到这里

32
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,900
I say that because of the thousands and thousands of messages I've had since I announced that Jordan Peterson, the man himself,

33
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:27,400
这个人从加拿大远道而来 坐在我的“厨房”里与我交谈 我收到了成千上万的消息

34
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:27,400
all the way from Canada came here to sit in my kitchen and have a conversation with me.

35
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:29,466
And what a conversation it was.

36
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:30,333
这真是一次了不起的对话

37
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:35,833
One of the most moving moments in the history of this podcast takes place in this conversation.

38
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:35,900
这个播客历史上最感人的时刻之一就发生在这次对话中

39
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:44,133
And I think the thing that people love about Jordan Peterson is his unrelenting desire to just say what he believes to be true,

40
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:46,700
我认为人们喜欢乔丹·彼得森的原因是他毫不动摇的只说出他认为是真实的东西 不是他认为是正确的东西

41
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:46,733
not what he believes to be correct,

42
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,266
不是人们想听的东西

43
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,266
not what people want to hear,

44
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,900
不是人们乐于听到的东西

45
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,900
not what people will be happy to hear.

46
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:53,700
And it's because of that,

47
00:01:52,833 --> 00:02:01,733
正因为如此 正因为他追求真理 他已经改变了数以百万计的人的生活

48
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:01,733
it's because of his pursuit of truth that he's managed to change millions and millions and millions of people's lives.

49
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,433
这绝对不是夸张

50
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,433
That is absolutely no understatement.

51
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,266
所以不用再说了 我是斯蒂芬·巴特利特 这是《CEO日记》

52
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,300
So without further ado, I'm Stephen Bartlett, and this is the diary of a CEO.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,966
我希望没人在听

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,900
I hope nobody's listening, but if you are, then please keep this to yourself.

55
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,766
但如果你在听的话 请保守这个秘密

56
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:29,133
首先 我觉得我应该感激你，我想说谢谢你对我的生活产生的影响

57
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:32,200
First, I feel like I owe you a debt of gratitude and I want to say thank you for the impact you've had on my life and I'll point at the specific impact you've had on my life.

58
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:32,166
我会指出你对我的生活产生的具体影响

59
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:36,466
And you asked me before we started recording why this podcast had been successful.

60
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:36,533
录音开始前你问我为什么这个播客会成功

61
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:46,300
其中一个原因实际上是我从读你的书和听你的讲话中获得的 那就是这种真正的承诺 努力做真实的自己 努力表达真实

62
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:46,233
One of the reasons is actually something I've gained from reading and listening to your work and that's this real commitment to trying to be your true self and trying to be your truth.

63
00:02:47,033 --> 00:03:00,100
如果我不了解真理在生活和人际关系的各个方面的重要性 这个播客就不会成功 我也不会在追求自我方面成功 这对我来说是非常关键的一点

64
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,133
This podcast wouldn't be successful and I wouldn't have been successful in terms of

65
00:02:52,133 --> 00:03:00,166
pursuing myself had I not understood the importance of truth across all facets of life and in my relationships, which is a real pivotal thing for me.

66
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,433
这要感谢你的工作

67
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,433
And that's thanks to you.

68
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:04,700
So what's changed in your relationships as a consequence of that?

69
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:04,700
那么 因此你的关系发生了什么变化？

70
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:14,866
所以我相信 如果你不说真话 不表达真实的自己 真正与某人建立联系是非常困难的

71
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:14,900
So I believe it's really difficult to truly connect with someone if you're not speaking and being your truth.

72
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:22,800
And I wasn't, I think I was wearing a mask in my relationships in the context if I didn't express how I was thinking and feeling,

73
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:26,300
而我 我没有做到 我认为如果我不表达我的想法和感受 我在人际关系中就戴着面具 我试图成为我认为我的伴侣希望我成为的人

74
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,266
I was trying to be who I thought my partner wanted me to be.

75
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:32,233
而当我放下面具 开始说出我的真实想法时

76
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,233
And at the point when I like, I let down the mask and I started speaking my truth,

77
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:38,733
Actually, as I was departing from the relationship, the relationship got stronger than ever before.

78
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:44,633
实际上 当我正要离开这段关系时 这段关系比以往任何时候都更加坚强 就像我们从未真正建立过联系 直到我对她 对我的感受 对我想要的生活保持真实

79
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,766
And it was like we were never actually connected until I was being true with her, with my feelings, with what I wanted, with my life.

80
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:54,000
从那以后 我会说我的关系是我所见过的所有浪漫关系中 最坚强的一个 

81
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:54,000
And since then, I would categorize my relationship as being the strongest thing I've ever seen in terms of a romantic connection with someone.

82
00:03:54,433 --> 00:04:01,100
And so when you were starting to talk in your relationship in a more truthful manner, what did that mean that you had to admit?

83
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:08,433
这意味着你必须承认什么？我是说你刚才说的部分是你试图成为的人和你真正的自我之间的脱节 这是一个人格问题 对吗？

84
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,300
I mean, you just said that part of it was a disconnect between who you were trying to be and who you really were.

85
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,466
So that's a persona issue, right?

86
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:15,366
So you think maybe, and everyone has this proclivity to some degree, is they're deeply self-conscious

87
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:17,100
所以你可能认为 每个人在某种程度上都有这种倾向 那就是他们非常关注自我并深陷不确定性

88
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:26,533
and uncertain, and so instead of allowing the person they're with to connect with that underlying uncertainty and inadequacy, they act out a persona.

89
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:26,566
因此 他们不会让身边的人感受到潜在的不确定性和不足 他们表现出一种人格

90
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:34,200
然后问题是 也许对方爱上了那个人格 但那里没有真正的联系

91
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:35,500
And then the problem is is that, well, perhaps the person falls in love with that persona, but there's no real connection there, it's an artifice.

92
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,466
这是一种人为的东西

93
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,833
说到这里 卡尔·荣格 伟大的心理治疗师关于人格说过的一件事是

94
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:48,166
And having said that, one of the things that Carl Jung, the great psychotherapist said about a persona is, don't be thinking that you're better off if you never formed one.

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,166
不要以为如果你从未形成过一个人格 你就会更好

96
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:58,466
所以对荣格来说 这是一次从婴儿时期的未分化自我通过人格到达真实性的旅程

97
00:04:49,033 --> 00:05:02,200
So for Jung, it was a voyage from say undifferentiated self in infancy and so forth through persona to authenticity, because you have to act out your ideals to some degree,

98
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:02,200
因为你在某种程度上必须表现出你的理想 对吗？

99
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:14,533
right, and you also have to formulate a avatar of yourself in some sense, that's a mediator between you and other people in casual social encounters.

100
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:14,533
你还必须在某种意义上为自己构建一个化身 作为你和其他人在日常社交场合中的中介

101
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:21,433
比如你不想走进银行 当你问柜员 “你好吗”时 柜员告诉你他或她的这一天怎么样 对吗？（译注：“你好吗”只是一个客套的寒暄 可柜员却真的开始倾诉自己的内心）

102
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:21,433
Like you don't wanna walk into the bank and have the teller tell you about his or her day when you say, how are you doing, right?

103
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:26,100
I mean, now and then that can happen, but generally it's too much intimacy too quickly.

104
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:26,100
我的意思是 这种情况偶尔会发生 但通常它过快地推进关系了

105
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:29,033
所以你需要这个功能性的外壳

106
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:35,666
And so you need this functional shell, but the problem arises when that functional shell is all that there is.

107
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:35,633
但问题出现在 当这个功能性外壳成为全部时

108
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:45,766
And then the real person underneath is just desperate and unhappy because nothing of what's being acted out reflects a true underlying reality.

109
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:45,766
然后真实的自我只是绝望和不快乐 因为表现出的一切都没有反映出真实的底层现实 （译注：人格面具理论）

110
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:49,333
What is the consequence, the long-term consequence of acting?

111
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:49,333
这种表演的长期后果是什么？

112
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,233
So many people, especially because of the world

113
00:05:49,766 --> 00:06:00,633
因此 很多人 尤其是因为我生活在Instagram和社交媒体的世界里 我们某种程度上构建了这些人格 然后我们几乎跟随这些人格随附的隐含指令？

114
00:05:52,900 --> 00:06:00,633
I live in on Instagram and social media, we kind of build out these personas and then we almost follow the implicit instructions that come with those personas.

115
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,633
So that's the problem right there is that,

116
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:02,633
那就是问题所在

117
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:14,366
well, that I'm trying to get a hold of the Disney people at the moment because I wanna do a lecture series on Pinocchio because I think Pinocchio is a brilliant work of art.

118
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:14,366
我现在正试图联系迪士尼的人 因为我想做一个关于《匹诺曹》的讲座系列 因为我认为《匹诺曹》是一部杰出的艺术作品

119
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:26,366
And if you're a puppet and an actor, and Pinocchio is both at times in that movie, both a puppet and an actor, so why an actor?

120
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:26,366
如果你是一个木偶和一个演员 而匹诺曹在那部电影中时而是木偶时而是演员 那么为什么要当一个演员呢？

121
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,933
或者说 为什么当一个演员会有问题呢？

122
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,900
Why is there something wrong with being an actor?

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,833
首先 谁设定了你的角色？

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,833
Well, the first question is, well, who sets your role?

125
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,500
然后第二个问题是 谁在操纵你？

126
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,500
And then the second question is, who's pulling your strings?

127
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:45,933
所以你表现出这样一个外表 目的是让你受欢迎、性感、令人渴望 并掩盖你自己的不足

128
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:47,300
So you've put on this front that is there to make you popular and sexy and desirable and to mask from yourself your own inadequacies, but that's a role.

129
00:06:46,466 --> 00:06:47,333
但那只是一个角色

130
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,900
Well, who wrote it and for what purpose?

131
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,900
那么 谁编写了它 又是为了什么目的？

132
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,466
And so Jung said, for example, that we all acted out a myth and whether we knew it or not.

133
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,466
所以荣格说 比如 我们都在表演一个神话 不管我们是否知道

134
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,000
And you know, maybe you're acting out a tragedy.

135
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,000
你知道 也许你在表演一个悲剧

136
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,300
Maybe you're acting out narcissus.

137
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,300
也许你在表演纳西索斯 （译注：在希腊神话中 "Narcissus" 是一个美丽的青年 因爱上了自己在水中的倒影而成为自恋的象征 他无法抗拒自己倒影的魅力 最终化为一朵水仙花 ）

138
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:12,000
You don't know because you've put that on yourself in an attempt in some ways to deliver to people what they want or more accurately to look as though you're delivering to people what they want.

139
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:12,000
你不知道 因为你在尝试以某种方式满足人们的需求 或者更准确地说 看起来像是在满足人们的需求

140
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,733
And it's not nothing to do that, right?

141
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,733
做到这一点并非微不足道 对吧？

142
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:19,266
Because at least you're attempting in some sense to adapt to the social world.

143
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:19,266
因为至少你在某种意义上尝试适应社会世界

144
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,366
Someone who's really infantile and dependent, someone who's never left home.

145
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,366
一个真正幼稚和依赖的人 一个从未离家的人

146
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,966
Part of their problem is that they haven't crafted persona

147
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:26,566
他们的部分问题是他们没有塑造一个人格

148
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:32,400
所以你不是想完全贬低它 但它无法代替真实的东西

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:37,500
so you don't want to denigrate it entirely but it's no substitute for the real thing and it turns out that not only is what we want from each other the real thing

150
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:41,333
事实证明 这不仅是我们对彼此的真实需求 而且也是你生命的冒险

151
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:48,700
but that's also the adventure of your life and so if you aren't truthful and that means unfortunately especially at the beginning when you start to be truthful

152
00:07:41,866 --> 00:07:53,666
因此 如果你不诚实 这意味着不幸的是 尤其是在一开始 当你开始诚实时 这意味着你需要在谦卑中深刻地接受自己的不足

153
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:55,866
it means deeply coming to terms with your inadequacies in humility so it's very painful

154
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:55,466
所以这是非常痛苦的

155
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:05,633
without that you don't have the adventure of your life you have the role that has been that you've acquiesced to and that'll take all the meaning out of your life

156
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,266
没有这个 你就没有你生命的冒险

157
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:05,466
你所扮演的角色已经是你所默许的 这会让你的生命失去所有的意义

158
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,666
the adventure of your life, you say, imagine who you could be and then aim single-mindedly at that

159
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:07,400
你生命的冒险

160
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,333
你说 想象一下你可以成为谁 然后一心一意地追求那个目标

161
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:17,500
我遇到这些年轻人 他们似乎知道自己可以成为什么 或者他们已经想象了自己可以成为什么

162
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:17,700
I encountered these young people who appear to know who they could be or they've imagined who they could be

163
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:25,200
but for whatever reason they seem to choose the certain and misery of their current situation, the job that's sucking their soul out or that relationship,

164
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,966
但无论出于何种原因 他们似乎选择了当前处境的某种痛苦

165
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,200
那些吸走他们灵魂的工作 或者那种关系

166
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,666
而不是选择他们在生命冒险中将遇到的不确定性

167
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,666
over the uncertainty they'll encounter as they go on the adventure of their life.

168
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:34,133
那么我要对那些年轻人 那些总是对我说 史蒂夫 我想做这个

169
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:34,133
So what would I say to these young people who always say to me, Steve, I wanna do this,

170
00:08:34,566 --> 00:08:39,166
但你可以看到他们被恐惧窒息 因为这就像——是的 好吧 就像 制定一个计划 伙计

171
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,166
but you can see them stifled by fear because it's like- Yeah, well, it's like, make a plan, man.

172
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:42,700
所以当我在做我的临床工作时

173
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:42,700
So when I was doing my clinical work,

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,233
我和我的来访者做了很多职业工作 包括初级水平的 我想说

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:57,033
which I did a lot of career work with my clients, both at a beginner level, I would say, like really a beginner level with people who had no employment whatsoever, no history of employment, who are undereducated and who lacked every skill you could possibly imagine.

176
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:57,166
真的是初级水平 对那些根本没有工作经历 没有就业史 受教育程度低 缺乏你能想象到的每一项技能的人

177
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:05,900
These are people who are really in dire straits, up to people who were operating at the top of their profession, but who could still strategize forward.

178
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:05,900
这些人真的处境非常艰难 甚至是那些在职业生涯中处于巅峰的人 但（即使是他们）仍然可以制定前进的战略

179
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,900
举个例子 比如你的工作陷入了死胡同

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,566
And so, for example, let's say you're at a dead end in your job, okay, so I don't find my work meaningful.

181
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:14,566
好吧 所以我觉得我的工作没有意义

182
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,966
All right, so that's a problem statement.

183
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,033
好的 那是一个问题陈述

184
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,233
It's like, well, why not?

185
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,233
就像 为什么没有？

186
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:22,100
I find the work I do repetitive and boring and without spirit.

187
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:28,033
我发现我做的工作重复且无聊 缺乏灵魂 我和我的老板关系不好或一般般 他都不知道我是谁

188
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:28,033
I have a bad relationship or a neutral relationship with my boss who doesn't know who I am.

189
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:30,666
我和同事有问题

190
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:30,666
I have problems with coworkers.

191
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
所有这些都需要被区分开 对吗？

192
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
All of that needs to be differentiated, right?

193
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:34,833
并且需要详细分析

194
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:34,833
And analyzed in detail.

195
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,900
所以我们可能会说 例如 假设你认为你在工作中被低估了 也许你确实被低估了

196
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,900
So we might say, for example, let's say you believe that you're undervalued at work and maybe you are.

197
00:09:41,766 --> 00:09:47,800
你需要做的是你有话要说 我们需要找出你需要说的是什么

198
00:09:41,766 --> 00:09:47,800
What you need to do is you have something to say and we would have to figure out what it is that you have to say.

199
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,400
但它会是某种变体

200
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,400
But it would be some variant of,

201
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,933
我产出的价值超出了我所获得的补偿

202
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,933
I'm bringing more value to the table than I'm being compensated for.

203
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:56,800
这让我感到泄气

204
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:56,800
And that's demoralizing me.

205
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:03,700
而且对你来说也不好 你是我的老板 因为如果我实际上比被认可的更有价值

206
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:03,700
And it's also not good for you, you being my boss, because if I'm actually more valuable than is being recognized,

207
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,366
那么你没有正确评价我

208
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,666
then the fact that you're not valuing me properly means that I will become demoralized.

209
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:09,666
意味着我会变得泄气

210
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:12,300
I won't work properly and you won't get the best out of me.

211
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:12,300
我将无法正常工作 你也无法从我这里得到最好的表现

212
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,100
So it's bad for both of us.

213
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,100
所以这对我们双方都不好

214
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:23,266
And if your boss is in principle, not amenable to such a discussion, then what you should seriously consider doing is finding another job.

215
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:23,266
如果你的老板原则上不愿意进行这样的讨论 那么你应该认真考虑找一份新工作

216
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,466
Okay, so let's say we're gonna set you up for this.

217
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,466
好 假设我们为此做准备

218
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,566
Okay, this isn't like next week's enterprise, man.

219
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,600
这不是下周的事业 伙计 这是你的生活

220
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,600
This is your life.

221
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:37,166
所以我首先会问的是 你的简历或CV是否准备好了？（译注：在职业和学术领域中 CV——Curriculum Vitae——是一份详细列出个人教育背景、工作经验、成就、技能和资质的文档 与简历（resume）相比 CV往往更为详细）

222
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:37,166
So the first thing I would ask is, well, do you have your resume or CV in order?

223
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,833
我已经三年没有打印它了

224
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,833
Well, I haven't typed it up for three years.

225
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,733
好的 要不要考虑把它拾起来 更新一下它

226
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,733
Well, what do you think about bringing it up?

227
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,866
Well, I'm pretty nervous about that because there's some holes in it.

228
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:49,900
我对此感到相当紧张 因为我的简历上有一些空白 我在大学的成绩不是很好 我对我的简历有点尴尬

229
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,900
And you know, I didn't do so well in college and I'm kind of embarrassed about my resume.

230
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,666
好吧 把它拿来

231
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,666
It's like, okay, bring it in.

232
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:53,833
我们来仔细看看

233
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:53,833
Let's go through it.

234
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:56,366
至少更新一下它

235
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:56,366
Let's at least update it.

236
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:57,800
看看哪里有空白

237
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:57,800
Let's look where the holes are.

238
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,266
看看在你看来哪里有不足之处 对吗？

239
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,266
Let's look at where the inadequacies are as far as you're concerned, right?

240
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,300
这不是我的评判 这是你的评判

241
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,300
This isn't my judgment, it's your judgment.

242
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:06,933
让我们一起检视这些评判 看看它们是否有根据

243
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:06,933
Let's walk through those judgments and see if they're warranted

244
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:15,000
因为也许你只是太感到内疚、羞愧、自我意识过强、焦虑 相比于他人 你更苛刻地看待自己的简历

245
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:15,000
because maybe you're just too guilty and ashamed and self-conscious and anxious and you're not, you're looking at your resume more critically than someone else would.

246
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,266
也许有些漏洞你需要修补

247
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,266
And maybe there's some holes that you need to rectify.

248
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:24,433
比如 你还差两门课就能拿到学士学位 但你却退学了

249
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:24,433
You know, you were two courses away from your BA and you dropped out or something like that.

250
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:28,533
那么 我们也许需要六个月来解决这个问题

251
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:28,533
Well, maybe we need six months to address that.

252
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,200
即使你不能完全受教育 你也可以在线上修一些课程

253
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,200
And at least, even if you can't be fully educated, you could be taking some courses online.

254
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,033
And so when you went to a new job interview and they said,

255
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:37,633
这样当你去面试一个新工作时 他们问到这个漏洞时

256
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:46,333
What about this whole, you'd say, well, I came to terms with that six months ago and in an effort to rectify it, I'm taking the following courses and here's my plan for completion.

257
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:44,866
你可以说 六个月前我已经开始着手解决这个问题 为了改正 我正在修以下课程

258
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:46,333
这是我的完成计划

259
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:48,233
That's a really good answer.

260
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:48,233
这是一个很好的回答

261
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:51,033
And anyone with any sense who's interviewing

262
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:58,966
任何有理智的面试官都会将其视为一个迹象 尽管你不完美——谁是完美的呢 但你有一个好计划 并且你已经深思熟虑

263
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:58,933
will accept that as an indication that although you're not perfect and who is that you have a good plan and that you've thought it through.

264
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:04,366
像这样的回答很有可能会巩固你成为该职位候选人的地位

265
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:04,366
Like that's the kind of answer that in all likelihood will cement your candidacy for the position.

266
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,666
好的 现在你要去找你的老板了

267
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,666
Okay, so now you're gonna go to your boss.

268
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:12,300
Well, you have to have your CV and your resume in order, and you have to be able to stand on it solidly,

269
00:12:07,366 --> 00:12:09,466
你必须整理好你的简历和履历

270
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,333
并且你必须能够坚定地站在它上面

271
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:21,266
and which at least means that you're prepared to address the inadequacies in a credible, realistic, believable, and truthful manner.

272
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:21,266
至少意味着你准备以一个可信和真实的方式来解决不足

273
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,266
All right, now what you do is apply for like 10 jobs.

274
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,266
好了 现在你做的是申请大概10个工作

275
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:28,133
You don't have to take them,

276
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:28,133
你不必全部参加

277
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:32,600
but maybe you have to go to an interview or two or three or four,

278
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,566
但也许你得去参加一两次或三四次面试

279
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,366
And maybe there's a bunch of opportunities out there for you that you didn't even know about.

280
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,366
也许有很多甚至你自己都不知道的机会在等着你

281
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,133
And maybe someone offers you a job.

282
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,133
也许有人给你提供了一份工作

283
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:42,666
这样你就可以去找你的老板说

284
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:46,866
And so now you can go to your boss and say, here's the situation I'm in here at work.

285
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:46,866
这是我在工作中的处境

286
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:51,533
Here's my evaluation of the problems in relationship to me.

287
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:51,533
这是我对与我有关的问题的评估

288
00:12:52,066 --> 00:13:00,166
Here's what I could do for you if you gave me a 40% raise and the opportunity to progress, but I'd like to see a plan for that.

289
00:12:52,066 --> 00:13:00,166
如果你给我40%的加薪和晋升的机会 我可以为你做些什么 但我想看到一个计划

290
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:06,533
And I've been looking for other opportunities before conducting this discussion and I have some.

291
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:06,533
在进行这次讨论之前 我一直在寻找其他机会 并且我已经有了一些（机会）

292
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:16,133
那么 如果这时你的老板对你表现出轻蔑 不听你讲 那么他或她可能比较理想的情况下要更自恋一些

293
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:17,733
Well, then if your boss treats you with contempt at that point and doesn't listen, then perhaps he or she is a little more narcissistic than might be optimal and it's time to find a new job.

294
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:17,733
是时候找一份新工作了

295
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:20,766
但这不是你草率决定的（微不足道的）事情

296
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:20,800
But this isn't something you do trivially.

297
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:29,200
And so when you're doubtful, say you're trapped, you ask yourself, well, why am I trapped?

298
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:29,200
所以 当你感到怀疑 比如你觉得自己被困住了 你要问自己 我为什么会被困？

299
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:31,366
That's a hard question, right?

300
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,366
这是一个艰难的问题 对吗？

301
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,233
Because some of it's your own inadequacy, a lot of it.

302
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:35,233
因为有一部分是你自己的不足 很大一部分

303
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:39,733
And all of the part of it that you can deal with is your own inadequacy.

304
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:39,733
而你能处理的所有部分就是你自己的不足

305
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:45,233
So even if it's unfair, you know, even if you're hemmed in for any number of reasons,

306
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:45,233
所以 即使这是不公平的 你知道 即使你因为任何原因被限制

307
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:56,766
inappropriate, like ethnically predicated oppression, let's say, or maybe you live it, you're in a workplace that really is sexist in some fundamental sense.

308
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:56,766
不合适的 比如基于种族的压迫 比方说 或者也许你生活在一个真正有性别歧视的工作环境中

309
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,766
Well, that's not good.

310
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,766
那不好

311
00:13:59,866 --> 00:14:01,400
这不公正 这不公平

312
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,833
It's not just, it's not fair, it's not meritorious, all of those things.

313
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:03,800
这不是基于成果（评估贡献）的 所有这些

314
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:05,300
Man, maybe you shouldn't be there.

315
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:05,300
也许你不应该在那里

316
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:16,566
But what you can do to begin with is every bloody thing you possibly can do to put yourself in the most virtuous and powerful negotiating position possible.

317
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:16,566
但你一开始能做的就是尽你所能做的一切 让自己处于最有德性（最有利）和最强大的谈判位置

318
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,566
And you have to think like a snake in some sense.

319
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,566
在某种意义上 你必须像蛇一样思考

320
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:23,333
To do that, you gotta get the details right.

321
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:23,333
要做到这一点 你必须正确地把握细节

322
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:24,933
你必须准备好咬人

323
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:28,300
You have to be prepared to bite and you have to have your eyes on the prize, so to speak.

324
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:28,300
你必须把眼光放在奖赏上 可以这么说

325
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:32,066
And people aren't taught this sort of thing ever, really.

326
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:32,066
人们从来真的没有被教导过这类事情

327
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,366
They're not taught how to negotiate.

328
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,366
他们没有被教导如何谈判

329
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:34,666
They're not taught how to goal set.

330
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:34,666
他们没有被教导如何设定目标

331
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:39,500
They're not taught how to conceptualize appropriate success in some broad sense.

332
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:39,500
他们没有被教导如何在某种广泛意义上构想适当的成功

333
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:43,800
In some sense, that's what the humanities are supposed to teach people, so.

334
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:43,800
在某种意义上 这是人文学科应该教给人们的

335
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,200
在理解我的不足或某人的不足这一点上 我真的相信

336
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:54,633
On that point of understanding my inadequacies or someone's inadequacies, I really believe that it's really difficult to undergo self-development if you don't have self-awareness.

337
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,633
如果你没有自我意识 那么你真的很难进行自我发展

338
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,400
And I was really trying to understand from your writings how someone is to build their self-awareness.

339
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,400
我真的在试图从你的著作中理解一个人如何建立他们的自我意识

340
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,266
It's almost like the unknown unknown.

341
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,266
这几乎像是未知的未知

342
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,933
If you don't have it, how do you build the thing?

343
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,933
如果你都不知道它 你怎么能构建它呢？

344
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:05,800
I know a good exercise for that.

345
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:05,800
我知道一个好的练习

346
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,466
It's like a prayer in some sense.

347
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,466
这在某种意义上像是祈祷

348
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,200
In fact, I would say it's proper prayer.

349
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,200
实际上 我会说这是正确的祈祷

350
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,800
If you wanna know something about yourself, sit on your bed one night and say to yourself, you gotta mean this, like, you gotta be desperate.

351
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,800
如果你想了解自己的一些事情 某个晚上坐在你的床上对自己说 你得真心这么想 就像 你必须绝望

352
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:18,033
This is no game, this.

353
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:18,033
这不是游戏

354
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,866
It's like, my life is not everything I want it to be.

355
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,866
就像 我的生活不是我想要的一切

356
00:15:23,566 --> 00:15:26,366
And perhaps it's not everything that I need it to be.

357
00:15:23,566 --> 00:15:26,366
也许它不是我所需要的一切

358
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:36,766
而“需要”的意思是 我的生活如此难以忍受 以至于随之而来的痛苦让我变得虚无、愤世嫉俗、痛苦、怨恨

359
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:42,100
And by need, I mean, my life is so unbearable that the suffering that's attended upon that is make me nihilistic, cynical, bitter, resentful, homicidal, genocidal, unable to have a good relationship,

360
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:42,100
有杀人倾向、灭绝人性、无法建立良好的关系

361
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,166
倾向于 因为我的嫉妒而惩罚人们的美德

362
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:52,633
prone to punish people for their virtues because of my jealousy, driving the proclivity to see evil everywhere except within my own heart.

363
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,633
倾向于 目之所及都是邪恶 却不愿意正视自己内心的邪恶

364
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:54,900
Like these are problems, man.

365
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:54,900
像这些都是问题 伙计

366
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,933
And you ask yourself, you sit on the bed and say, okay, man, I'm ready to learn something.

367
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,933
你问自己 坐在床上 说 好吧 伙计 我准备学习一些东西

368
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:11,866
Like, what's one thing I'm doing wrong that I know I'm doing wrong that I could fix that I would fix?

369
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:11,866
比如 有哪件我做错了的事 我知道我做错了 我能够去修补 我想要去修补

370
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:16,166
It's like, you meditate on that, you'll get an answer.

371
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:16,166
你对此进行沉思 你会得到一个答案

372
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,433
And it won't be one you want,

373
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,433
这不会是你想要的答案 但它会是必要的答案

374
00:16:18,966 --> 00:16:21,466
but it'll be the necessary one, you know?

375
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,366
它通常会引导你发现一些细节

376
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,366
And it's often something that will point you to small things.

377
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:30,500
所以卡尔·荣格说 现代世界的人们看不见上帝 因为他们寻找的视角不够低

378
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:30,500
So Carl Jung said, people in the modern world don't see God because they don't look low enough.

379
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,566
因此想象你在你杂乱的卧室里

380
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,566
And so imagine you're in your messy bedroom,

381
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:39,200
你知道 你坐在床边尝试与自己进行诚实的对话

382
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:39,200
you know, and you're sitting on the edge of the bed trying to have an honest dialogue with yourself.

383
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,366
And the little voice says,

384
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,966
小声音说 你知道 这里真的很恶心

385
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:43,000
you know, it's pretty disgusting in here.

386
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:48,266
你想 好吧 我远远高贵（超出）于这种整理我的房间这样的琐碎小事

387
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:48,266
And you think, well, I'm way above such trivial niceties as organizing my room.

388
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:52,566
这就是 好吧 那是骄傲 那是傲慢

389
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:52,566
It's like, well, that's pride, that's arrogance.

390
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,400
如果你不屑于整理真正属于你的东西

391
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,400
If you're above organizing what's actually yours,

392
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,733
你怎么可能整理其他任何东西呢？

393
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,733
how in the world are you ever gonna organize anything else?

394
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:03,533
所以你跪下 思考

395
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:03,533
And so you get on your knees and you think,

396
00:17:04,466 --> 00:17:10,733
好吧 是时候拿起刷子刷厕所了 也许这就是你开始的地方

397
00:17:04,466 --> 00:17:10,733
well, it's time to take a brush to the toilet and maybe that's where you start.

398
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:14,033
这样做是有效的 确实有效

399
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:14,033
And so, and that works, like that works.

400
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:19,300
你开始做这些微小的改进 像真正的微小改进 真正的实际操作

401
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:19,300
You start making those micro improvements, like real micro improvements, real on the ground,

402
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,300
对你知道是错误的事情进行实际的微小改进

403
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,866
actual micro improvements to things you know that are wrong, you'll improve unbelievably rapidly.

404
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:24,900
你会难以置信地快速改进

405
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,166
好 你谈论这个

406
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:33,633
Well, you're talking about this, sounds to me a lot like an over dose of arrogance and also the need for humility.

407
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:33,666
在我听来很像是过度的傲慢以及需要谦卑

408
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:43,366
Do you think the Western world suffers from arrogance because of our relative privilege and luxury that we kind of overlook?

409
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:43,366
你认为西方世界因为我们所忽视的相对特权和奢侈而遭受傲慢之苦吗？

410
00:17:43,466 --> 00:17:45,200
Of course, well, that's a temptation, right?

411
00:17:43,466 --> 00:17:45,200
当然 这是一种诱惑 对吗？

412
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:51,733
I mean, when the left radical lefty types go after people for their unearned privilege, they have a point.

413
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:51,733
我的意思是 当左派激进分子因为份外的特权而攻击人们时 他们有一点道理

414
00:17:52,966 --> 00:18:01,633
Now, the point is the existentialists called it throne-ness, which is not, that's a Heideggerian term.

415
00:17:52,966 --> 00:18:01,633
现在 存在主义者称之为“被抛” 这是海德格的术语

416
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:08,800
And throne-ness is the fact that we kind of experience life as if we're tossed into it, thrown into it.

417
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:08,800
被抛是指我们仿佛被投入到生活中、被抛入到生活中 去经历生活

418
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,066
You know, you're male and not female.

419
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,066
你知道 你是男性而非女性

420
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,966
You're Hindu and not Christian.

421
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,966
你是印度教徒而非基督徒

422
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,366
You're tall and not short.

423
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,366
你个子高而不是矮

424
00:18:16,866 --> 00:18:24,000
You have an arbitrary range of talents and an arbitrary range of limitations, none of which in some sense you chose.

425
00:18:16,866 --> 00:18:24,000
你有一系列随机的才能和一系列随机的限制 从某种意义上说 这些都不是你选择的

426
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,100
It's the cards you're dealt.

427
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,100
这就是你被发的牌

428
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,866
Now, some of those are cards of privilege.

429
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,866
现在 其中一些是特权牌

430
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,100
Now, maybe you're born intelligent.

431
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,100
也许你天生聪明

432
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:32,700
Maybe you're born symmetrical.

433
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:32,700
也许你天生匀称

434
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,400
Maybe you're born healthy.

435
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,400
也许你天生健康

436
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,933
Maybe you're born into a culture where it's much easier not to be absolutely deprived.

437
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,933
也许你出生在一个不极端贫困的文明中

438
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,366
Maybe your parents are rich.

439
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,366
也许你的父母很富有

440
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:46,866
And so all of that in some sense is unearned.

441
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:46,866
所以所有这些在某种意义上都是份外的

442
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:55,833
现在 随之而来的是大量的存在性负罪感 因为同时 这对任何人来说都是如此

443
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:58,433
Now, along with that comes a good dose of existential guilt because at the same time, and this is true for anyone, regardless of their cultural background,

444
00:18:56,666 --> 00:19:04,533
无论他们的文化背景如何 我们走过的地面都浸透了历史暴行的血迹

445
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:04,533
the ground we walk on is soaked in the blood of historical atrocity.

446
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:11,700
所以这就落在了你身上 因为人们想知道 谁是纳粹？

447
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:11,700
And so that's on you because people think, well, who's the Nazi?

448
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:16,100
谁是法西斯 或者谁是激进的共产主义者

449
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:16,100
Well, it's the fascist or it's the, or who's the radical communist.

450
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,000
谁是激进的左翼意识形态者

451
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,000
It's the radical left-wing ideologue.

452
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:29,100
事实上 最好将其视为一个精神问题 最深刻的敌人其实在内心

453
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:29,100
And the fundamental truth of the matter is that's best dealt with as a spiritual matter, is the adversary is within really most profoundly.

454
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:35,700
因此 你必须将那些历史上的暴行的责任承担在自己身上

455
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:35,700
And so you have to take the responsibility for that historical atrocity onto yourself.

456
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,633
我本周与盖·里奇讨论了他的电影《亚瑟王》

457
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,633
I was talking to Guy Ritchie this week about his movie, King Arthur.

458
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:41,800
这部电影在许多方面都颇为有趣

459
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:41,800
It's quite an interesting movie in many ways.

460
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:51,400
当可能成为英雄的亚瑟拿起这把剑时 他被他凶残的叔叔的幻象所困扰 以至于无法拿起武器

461
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:51,400
And when Arthur, who could be the hero, takes the sword, he's so overcome by visions of his murderous uncle that he can't pick up the weapon.

462
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,000
想想看

463
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,000
Well, think about that.

464
00:19:54,533 --> 00:20:00,333
现在你有可以使用的武器 但它们曾经被你那杀人犯的叔叔使用过

465
00:19:54,533 --> 00:20:00,333
Now you have weapons at your disposal, but they've been used by your murderous uncle.

466
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,933
你怎么敢使用它们？

467
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,933
How dare you wield them?

468
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:04,666
答案是

469
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:04,666
And the answer is,

470
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:15,566
也许把剑留在地上更简单 因为你确实不想为未来可能发生的暴行负责 也不以为你不可能会这样 也不以为你可能不会对此感到愉快

471
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:15,566
maybe it's easy just to leave the sword on the ground because you do wanna be responsible for atrocities going forward and don't think you couldn't be and don't think you might not enjoy it.

472
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:21,633
因此 你为自己的特权付出的代价就是你的美德

473
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:21,633
And so the way you pay for your privilege is with your virtue.

474
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,166
而我尤其认为

475
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,166
I mean that most particularly.

476
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:31,133
你有这些机会和这种存在性的罪恶感

477
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:31,133
You have these opportunities and this existential guilt and the way you expiate that and atone

478
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:37,033
is by doing your best to live the best possible life you can manage, to speak the truth,

479
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:39,166
而你弥补的方式就是 尽你最大的努力过上你能做到的最好的生活 说真话 尊重他人

480
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:39,133
to treat people with respect,

481
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,200
遵守个人尊严的原则 并且整理好你的家务

482
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,200
to abide by the principles of the dignity of the individual and to put your house in order.

483
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:47,966
这就是你为你份外的特权付出的代价 我们所有人都是这样

484
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:47,966
And that's how you pay for your unearned privilege, all of us.

485
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,266
我们都有我们的特权和诅咒 对吧

486
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,266
And we all have our privileges and our curses, you know?

487
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:54,700
我们所有人都有

488
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:54,700
All of us have that.

489
00:20:54,966 --> 00:20:57,066
这就是为什么嫉妒别人是没有用的

490
00:20:54,966 --> 00:20:57,066
That's why it's not useful to be envious of people.

491
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:05,000
你知道 你是个年轻人 你看到有人开着法拉利经过 旁边坐着个金发美女 你想 我的天 他拥有一切

492
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:05,000
You know, you see some, you're a young man, you see someone drive by in a Ferrari with blonde and you think, my God, he's got everything.

493
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:12,800
但 车里的女人是个可卡因成瘾的妓女 她的生活是一个又一个的灾难

494
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:12,800
And you know, the woman in the car is a prostitute who's got a cocaine addiction and her life is just one catastrophe after another.

495
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:16,166
而开车的人可能不得不通过欺骗和作弊来达到这个位置

496
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:16,166
And he's had to lie and cheat his way into this position.

497
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:19,533
他害怕一切都会崩溃 砸在他身上

498
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:19,533
And he's afraid that everything's going to come crashing down on him.

499
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:21,200
而这就是你嫉妒的

500
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:21,200
And that's what you're jealous of.

501
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,766
这其实并不那么深刻

502
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,766
And it's just not that profound.

503
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,100
你不想要别人的命运

504
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,100
You don't want someone else's fate.

505
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,500
伙计 你的命运就够了 你的冒险就够了

506
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,500
Man, your fate's enough and your adventure's enough.

507
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,300
这已经很多了

508
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,300
It's plenty.

509
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,700
这比你能完全实现的还要多

510
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,700
It's more than you can ever fully realize.

511
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:40,300
因此 这也是我们所有人都相信个体具有某种内在尊严的部分原因

512
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:40,300
And so that's also part of the reason that we all believe that the individual has some intrinsic dignity.

513
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:44,366
不要那么笃定你的位置和你的房间是那么无足轻重

514
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:44,366
It's don't be so sure that your position and your room is so damn trivial.

515
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:47,000
也许是你把他们当作琐碎的、微不足道的小事来对待

516
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:47,000
It might be your attitude towards it that's trivial.

517
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:50,566
如果你处于困境和恶劣的环境

518
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:50,566
And if you're in dire straits and dire circumstances,

519
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,100
只要看看你有多少机会让事情变得更好

520
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,100
just look at how much opportunity you have to make things better.

521
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,133
所以这并不容易

522
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,133
So not that it's easy.

523
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,200
你甚至不希望它变得容易

524
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,200
You don't even want it to be easy.

525
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,466
不 所以

526
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,466
No, so.

527
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:10,833
关于这一点 “你不希望它变得容易” 我真的一直在与我生活中的斗争和混乱的想法以及它所扮演的角色作斗争

528
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:10,833
On that point of you don't want it to be easy, I really contended with this idea of struggle and chaos in my life and the role it plays.

529
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:16,666
And once upon a time, I thought I was trying to rid my life of chaos and struggle.

530
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:16,700
曾几何时 我以为我试图从生活中清除混乱和斗争

531
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,233
我以为这就是我试图变得富有、得到法拉利和金发女郎的原因

532
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,266
I thought that's why I was trying to get rich and get the Ferrari and the blonde.

533
00:22:21,266 --> 00:22:23,733
我以为那会创造一个没有斗争的生活

534
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,766
I thought that would create a life free of struggle.

535
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:30,433
但后来我看了一些研究 听说了一个叫做“金牌抑郁症”的东西 当奥运会运动员从奥运会回来后 他们失去了方向感

536
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:30,433
But then I looked at some studies and I heard about this thing called gold medal depression when Olympians come back from the Olympics and they've lost orientation.

537
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:35,700
然后有一天 当有人提出以八、九位数的价格购买我的公司时

538
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:35,700
And then the day when someone offered to buy my company for a eight, nine, nine figure number.

539
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:38,933
它让我感到了空虚和恐惧

540
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:38,966
And it filled me with this emptiness and this dread.

541
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:45,900
And I tried to understand the role that struggle would have to play for me to be a fulfilled human being for the rest of my life.

542
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:45,900
我试图理解对于我在余生成为一个充实的人 “斗争”在其中所扮演的角色

543
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,400
Yeah, well, the observation with regard to your company, that's a great observation.

544
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:51,366
是的 关于你的公司的观察 这是一个伟大的观察

545
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,700
我的意思是 我们生来就是为了向上攀爬

546
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:53,666
I mean, we're built to walk uphill.

547
00:22:54,566 --> 00:22:59,666
And when you reach the pinnacle of the hill, you want to stop and appreciate the vision.

548
00:22:54,566 --> 00:23:09,500
当你到达山顶时 你想停下来欣赏景色 但接下来你想要的是远处更高的山 因为正是从向上攀爬中 我们获得了我们的价值

549
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:09,500
But the next thing you want is a higher hill in the distance because it's the uphill climb that it's from the uphill climb that we derive our value.

550
00:23:09,566 --> 00:23:10,733
我是从技术上讲的

551
00:23:09,566 --> 00:23:10,733
And I mean this technically.

552
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:13,500
So almost all the positive emotion we feel,

553
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:22,500
因此 几乎所有我们感受到的正面情绪 尤其是让我们充满热情的情绪 那就是被上帝灵充满 因为这就是热情的含义

554
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:22,533
especially the emotion that fills us with enthusiasm, and that's to be filled with the Spirit of God, by the way, because that's what enthusiasm means,

555
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:27,000
that's experienced in relationship to a goal.

556
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:27,033
那是与目标有关的经历

557
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:30,700
因此 在某种意义上 这是宗教事业的一部分

558
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:34,200
And so in some sense, and this is part of the religious enterprise, you want a goal that you can never attain, right?

559
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,200
你想要一个你永远无法达到的目标 对吧？

560
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:38,666
这样你就可以不断接近一个随着你接近而后退的目标

561
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,633
So you can always move closer to the goal that recedes as you move towards it.

562
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,800
你可能会觉得这很挫败

563
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,800
You think, well, that's frustrating.

564
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,700
这就像西西弗斯推石头上山

565
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,766
It's like Sisyphus pushing the rock uphill.

566
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,633
但并非如此 因为当你追求那个目标时

567
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:45,666
But it's not because as you pursue that goal,

568
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:50,433
你整合了自己 你的生活确实变得更好、更丰富、更充裕

569
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,433
you put yourself together and your life does get better and richer and more abundant.

570
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,500
这就是为什么最高层次的美德和目标在某种意义上是超越的

571
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:55,533
And that's why the highest levels of virtue and goal are in some sense transcendent.

572
00:23:56,166 --> 00:24:02,600
你希望它们超越你正在做的一切 这样你就可以不断向着更崇高、更好的东西前进

573
00:23:56,166 --> 00:24:02,600
You want them to be above everything you're doing so you can continually move towards something that's more sublime and better.

574
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:04,033
这就是你

575
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,066
That's what you are.

576
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,133
你在这里是为了生活 而不是为了睡觉

577
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,133
You're here to live, not to sleep.

578
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:12,433
And the problem with the vision of my ties on the beach is that, well, first of all,

579
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:16,833
在海滩上穿西装的愿景的问题是 首先 那是药物诱导的无意识状态的愿景

580
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,800
that's a vision of drug-induced unconsciousness.

581
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,133
其次 这只会持续大约一个星期

582
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,133
Second, it's only gonna work for about a week.

583
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:25,100
第三 一个月后你会成为笑柄 心情沮丧、漫无目的和没有目标

584
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:25,100
Third, you're gonna be a laughing stock in a month and depressed and aimless and goal-less.

585
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:30,300
It's, no, that's not, it's, you want a horizon of ever expanding possibility.

586
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:30,333
不 那不是 你想要一个不断扩展可能性的视野

587
00:24:30,966 --> 00:24:32,700
And so it does happen to people as they,

588
00:24:30,966 --> 00:24:32,733
所以它确实发生在人们身上

589
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:37,600
因为他们把灵魂押注在了实现一个工具性（手段性）的目标上

590
00:24:33,066 --> 00:24:37,600
because they've staked their soul on the attainment of an instrumental goal.

591
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,833
这可以是一个相当高阶的目标

592
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,833
And it can be a pretty high order goal, it was in your case, but then you think,

593
00:24:39,866 --> 00:24:40,700
在你的案例中就是这样

594
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,500
但然后你想 好吧 现在我在这里了 接下来呢？

595
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,533
well, now I'm there, now what?

596
00:24:45,866 --> 00:24:46,900
Well, the answer can't be,

597
00:24:45,866 --> 00:24:46,933
答案不会是

598
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:54,533
well, I'm going to live in the lap of luxury and never have to leave the, what do you wanna be, a giant infant with a gold bottle?

599
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:54,700
我将生活在奢侈中 永远不必离开 你想成为什么 一个拿着金瓶的巨婴吗？

600
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,100
你永远不需要做任何事情 只需要躺在背上吸吮

601
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,133
You never have to do anything but lay in your back and suck.

602
00:24:57,333 --> 00:25:03,166
就像 嗯 你可以看到这个问题是一个概念化的问题

603
00:24:57,333 --> 00:25:03,166
It's like, well, you see the problem with that as a conceptualization.

604
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:09,366
It's no, you wanna be like an active warrior moving uphill with your sword in hand.

605
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:09,400
你想成为一个手持宝剑向山上进发的自发的战士

606
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:12,733
那是充满活力的 那是令人兴奋的

607
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:12,766
And that's dynamic, that's exciting.

608
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:16,400
And that's why so many young men disappear into video games.

609
00:25:12,866 --> 00:25:16,400
这就是为什么这么多年轻人沉迷于电子游戏的原因

610
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,400
That's all acted out in the video game.

611
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,400
那一切都在视频游戏中表现出来了 （译注：在游戏中 玩家体验到这种冒险、向前的经历）

612
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,333
So they have to act that out in their own life.

613
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,333
所以他们必须在自己的生活中表现出来

614
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:25,800
不是我看不起视频游戏 但它们不能替代生活

615
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:25,833
Not that I despise video games, because I don't, but they're not a substitute for life.

616
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:29,200
They might be good training under some conditions for life.

617
00:25:26,366 --> 00:25:29,233
它们在某些条件下可能是生活的不错的训练

618
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,900
我还特别想问你的是 过去两年世界上发生的事情

619
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,933
One of the things I was also really, really keen to ask you was about what's happened in the world over the last two years.

620
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:40,000
我们在商业世界中看到的变化之一是向远程工作的转变

621
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:41,900
One of the shifts we've seen in the business world is this move to remote working and I hate it.

622
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:52,100
我讨厌它 出于各种原因我讨厌它 因为我感觉在我的生活中很少有机构让我有机会与人真正意义上的连接

623
00:25:42,266 --> 00:25:47,100
And I hate it for a variety of reasons because I feel like there's very few institutions

624
00:25:47,466 --> 00:25:52,100
in my life where I have a chance to meaningfully connect with people.

625
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,966
约会变成了屏幕

626
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:54,000
Dating has become screens.

627
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,900
社交变成了屏幕

628
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,933
Socializing has become screens.

629
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:07,566
办公室 办公室在我的生活中是我——特别是作为一个年轻人+几乎是我遇到90%当前最好的朋友以及伴侣的地方之一

630
00:25:56,633 --> 00:26:01,566
And the office, the institution of the office in my life was one of the places, especially as a younger man,

631
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,600
where I got to meet pretty much 90% of my current best friends and also partners.

632
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:15,200
我真的很担心未来 10 年坐在 Zoom 后面工作 （译注：Zoom 是一个流行的视频会议和远程沟通软件 广泛用于个人和企业之间的在线会议、远程工作、虚拟教育课堂、网络研讨会等）

633
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:15,200
And I really worry about sitting behind a Zoom, doing my work for the next 10 years.

634
00:26:15,933 --> 00:26:17,366
What is your take on remote working?

635
00:26:15,933 --> 00:26:17,400
你对远程工作有什么看法？

636
00:26:18,033 --> 00:26:22,333
Well, I like it and I don't like it.

637
00:26:18,066 --> 00:26:22,333
嗯 我既喜欢也不喜欢

638
00:26:23,266 --> 00:26:33,800
I think it's very difficult for us to understand our embodied environments well enough to duplicate them in a healthy and comprehensive manner in the virtual world.

639
00:26:23,266 --> 00:26:33,800
我认为我们很难充分理解我们的现实环境 从而在虚拟世界中以健康、全面的方式复制它们

640
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:41,233
Because we just don't understand what it is that we're doing when we actually do things rather than represent them.

641
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:41,233
我们在真正做事情而不仅仅是表达它们时 往往不理解我们所做的事情的本质（译注：在许多情况下 人们可能会理论化或想象某种行为的效果 但在实际行动时 结果和影响可能与预期大相径庭 因为实际操作涉及的变量和复杂性远远超出了理论上的考量）

642
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,133
So for example, I've thought a lot about online university.

643
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,133
例如 我对线上大学思考了很多

644
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:46,966
Okay, so then you could imagine,

645
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:46,966
好吧 那么你可以想象

646
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:51,766
well, you can certainly imagine online lecture courses.

647
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:51,766
线上讲座课程肯定是可以想象的

648
00:26:53,266 --> 00:26:59,133
And you could say, well, the fact that they can be delivered on a large scale, very inexpensively, is a virtue.

649
00:26:53,266 --> 00:26:59,133
你可以说 它们的好处是 可以大规模地、非常便宜地提供

650
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,333
You can bring the knowledge to a very large number of people at a low cost, so why not do that?

651
00:27:00,033 --> 00:27:05,333
你可以以低成本为大量人群带来知识 那么为什么不这样做呢？

652
00:27:06,533 --> 00:27:07,900
And so that's half the university.

653
00:27:06,533 --> 00:27:08,100
所以那是大学的一半

654
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:13,366
And then you could say, well, imagine that you generated the system of universal tests, which is possibility,

655
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:17,833
然后你可以说 想象你生成了一套普遍测试系统（译注：全面实施的测试体系 类似于考核、测试） 这是可能的 这意味着你也可以以低成本为每个人带来认证

656
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:17,866
and that means you could bring accreditation to everyone at a low cost as well.

657
00:27:18,366 --> 00:27:19,100
And that's that.

658
00:27:18,366 --> 00:27:20,666
那么 大学就在线上了

659
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:20,666
The university's online.

660
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:26,100
但这个过程是你假设自己知道大学是什么 但你实际上不知道

661
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:29,366
But that presumes that you know what the university is and you don't because well here's some other things the university is

662
00:27:26,766 --> 00:27:29,400
因为 嗯 大学还有其他一些东西

663
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:38,066
An excuse for young a credible excuse that socially sanctioned for young people who have not yet established a career goal

664
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:41,600
一个可信的、社会认可的理由 让尚未确立职业目标的年轻人树立向上奋斗的身份

665
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:45,600
To adopt an identity of upward striving for four years away from their parents while they meet a new group of friends

666
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:45,633
在他们离开父母四年的同时 他们遇见了一群新朋友

667
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:52,200
Like that might be 90% of the university for all we know, because it's certainly, for me, for example,

668
00:27:46,566 --> 00:27:52,233
就像这可能是大学的90% 因为这对我来说 例如

669
00:27:52,966 --> 00:27:59,566
when I went to college, I left home when I was 17 and I left this small town I had grown up in.

670
00:27:52,966 --> 00:27:59,566
当我上大学时 我17岁就离家出走 离开了我长大的小镇

671
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:03,900
And in many ways, I left the peers that I had been associating with.

672
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:03,900
在许多方面 我离开了我一直交往的同龄人

673
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,833
Now, a couple of them came to college with me.

674
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,333
现在 他们中的几个和我一起上了大学 所以我在那里有了一个立足点

675
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,566
So I had a toehold there, but I made an entirely different group of friends.

676
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,566
但我结交了完全不同的一群朋友

677
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:17,600
And they were friends whose goals were quite radically different from the friends that I, let's say, in some sense, left behind.

678
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:17,600
在某种意义上 这些朋友的目标与我之前的朋友的目标完全不同

679
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:27,000
Well, the reformulation of my peer network might've been the most important part of the first part of my education.

680
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:27,000
重组我的同伴网络可能是我教育的第一部分中最重要的一部分

681
00:28:27,066 --> 00:28:28,633
现在 我在这个地方很幸运

682
00:28:27,066 --> 00:28:30,033
Now, I was fortunate at this place, it was called Grand Prairie College.

683
00:28:28,766 --> 00:28:30,066
它被称为大草原城地区学院

684
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:36,400
I had seven professors, seven, which is really good, who really loved to teach.

685
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:36,400
我有七位教授 七位 这真的很棒 他们真正热爱教学

686
00:28:36,566 --> 00:28:39,766
And so I also learned a lot in the formal sense.

687
00:28:36,566 --> 00:28:39,766
因此我也在正式的意义上学到了很多东西

688
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:42,933
但在我做这些的同时 我也在谈判

689
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,966
But while I was doing that, I was also negotiating,

690
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:45,266
比如 你实际上应该聚会多少呢？

691
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:45,266
well, how much partying do you actually do?

692
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,933
因为零不是正确的数量

693
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,933
Cause zero isn't the right amount,

694
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:56,966
但是每个该死的晚上直到凌晨三点也不是正确的数量 因为你必须在现实和向上努力之间取得平衡

695
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:56,966
but every goddamn night till three in the morning isn't the right amount either because you have to balance that in some sense with practicality and upward striving.

696
00:28:57,166 --> 00:29:00,666
那么 我该如何与他人生活？

697
00:28:57,166 --> 00:29:00,666
And so, and how do I live with other people?

698
00:29:00,766 --> 00:29:08,133
我的室友 所以我有一个室友 他仍然是我的好朋友 今年我生病的时候 他字面上和我一起走了一千英里

699
00:29:00,766 --> 00:29:08,133
My roommate, so I had one roommate who's a really good friend of mine still, and he walked a thousand miles with me this year when I was ill, literally.

700
00:29:08,866 --> 00:29:13,766
所以我真的很喜欢和他一起生活 因为他是个硬汉

701
00:29:08,866 --> 00:29:13,766
So I really liked living with him because he was tough guy,

702
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:22,633
在铅冶炼厂工作 他是个牛仔 他是个硬汉 比我大四岁 大约大三岁

703
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:22,633
worked in lead smelters and he was a cowboy and he was a tough guy, four years older than me, about three years older than me.

704
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:28,266
在经历了这些艰苦的工人阶级职业之后 他回到学校

705
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:28,266
He'd come back to school after bouncing around through these like tough working class occupations.

706
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,566
他在很多方面都很脚踏实地

707
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,566
And he had his feet on the ground in lots of ways.

708
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:39,633
我真的很喜欢他作为室友 因为我会买一些食材 然后他也会买一些食材 或者我做晚饭 他做早餐

709
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:39,633
And I really liked him as a roommate because I'd buy some groceries and then he'd buy some groceries or I'd make dinner and he'd make breakfast.

710
00:29:39,766 --> 00:29:44,533
这一切都从未明确地商议过

711
00:29:39,766 --> 00:29:44,533
And none of that was ever explicitly negotiated.

712
00:29:45,266 --> 00:29:49,833
他对这种互惠的 从技术上讲是互利的行为非常清楚

713
00:29:45,266 --> 00:29:49,833
He was just very aware of this reciprocal, it's reciprocal altruism technically.

714
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:56,500
他非常擅长 我们俩都擅长认识到我们的相互义务并履行它们

715
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:56,500
He was very good at, we were both good at tracking our mutual obligations and fulfilling them.

716
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,200
So we had a very peaceful relationship.

717
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,200
所以我们的关系非常和平

718
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:04,300
I lived with him for a year and then a little bit at different times and in different places.

719
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:04,300
我和他住了一年 然后在不同的时间和不同的地方又住了一段时间

720
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:09,366
And I learned to live with a whole variety of roommates.

721
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:09,366
我学会了与各种各样的室友共处

722
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,366
I had many roommates.

723
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,366
我有很多室友

724
00:30:11,966 --> 00:30:19,433
We had a kind of a frat house in the first college I went to and I think anywhere from six to 20 people lived there depending on the week, you know.

725
00:30:11,966 --> 00:30:19,433
我们在我去的第一所大学有一种类似兄弟会的房子 我想那里住着的人数根据周而定 大约从六到二十人不等

726
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,066
It was really, it was ridiculous.

727
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,066
这真的很荒谬

728
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,433
It was way too much fun.

729
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,400
那是太多的乐趣了 这也是个问题

730
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,400
And that was also a problem.

731
00:30:24,466 --> 00:30:34,333
但当我回顾我生命中的那段时间时 我肯定不能把教育经历简化为虚拟课程和虚拟测试

732
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:34,333
But when I look back on that time in my life, I certainly can't reduce the educational experience to virtual classes and virtual tests.

733
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:35,933
That's maybe that's 10% of it.

734
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,800
也许那只占10%

735
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,933
And we don't know how to replicate those environments that are so formative,

736
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:45,133
我们不知道如何复制那些如此有形成作用的环境 特别是它们的日常性 你知道吗？

737
00:30:42,433 --> 00:30:45,100
especially in their everydayness, you know,

738
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,033
因为你和你的室友一起生活

739
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,033
because you live with your roommates.

740
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,766
That's a 24 hour thing.

741
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,900
那是24小时的事情

742
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:56,666
And so the problem with virtualization is that we don't understand our environments well enough

743
00:30:50,200 --> 00:31:04,500
因此 虚拟化的问题在于 当我们只关注我们认为概念上重要的内容时 我们对环境的了解不够充分 无法确定我们没有排除一些重要的东西

744
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:04,466
to be certain that we're not excluding something vital when we concentrate only on what we think conceptually is important.

745
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:10,000
现在 我和我儿子定期见面 为了我们正在进行的一个项目

746
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:10,000
Now, I meet with my son pretty regularly for a project we're working on,

747
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,433
这是一个应用程序 将在人们写作和使用它时教会他们如何写作

748
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,433
which is an app that will teach people to write while they write and use it.

749
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,966
所以我们对此非常兴奋 但我每周和他线上见面一次

750
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,966
So we're quite excited about this, but I meet with him virtually once a week.

751
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,066
这实际上非常高效

752
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,066
And it's actually very efficient.

753
00:31:22,733 --> 00:31:23,566
他出现在屏幕上

754
00:31:22,733 --> 00:31:23,566
He's on the screen.

755
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,500
我们可以看到我们的项目就在我们面前

756
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,500
We can see our project in front of us.

757
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:31,300
我们可以共同编辑一些基础的教育材料

758
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:31,300
We can do mutual editing of some of the underlying material, educational material.

759
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,966
现实中也有对应的地点

760
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,966
There's a real place for it.

761
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:39,100
我在多伦多北部有一个小屋 我们在那里设立了一个类似你这里的工作室

762
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:40,866
And I have a cottage up north in Toronto where we've set up a studio like your studio here, although ours isn't quite as impressive.

763
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,866
虽然我们的工作室没那么令人印象深刻

764
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:46,500
但我可以与世界上任何地方的任何人进行采访和讨论

765
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:49,666
But I can have an interview and discussion with anyone anywhere in the world, even in a foreign language.

766
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,666
甚至是用外语

767
00:31:49,766 --> 00:31:52,100
And that's like unbelievably remarkable.

768
00:31:49,766 --> 00:31:52,100
这真的非常了不起

769
00:31:52,666 --> 00:32:00,200
But that doesn't mean that we know how to virtualize reality or that we should flee into it, right?

770
00:31:52,666 --> 00:32:00,200
但这并不意味着我们知道如何虚拟化现实 或者我们应该逃避现实 对吗？

771
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:07,200
And these new technologies, they're unbelievably radical and they're very hard to master.

772
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:07,200
这些新技术是非常激进的 它们很难掌握

773
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:12,466
And so we all have to be careful and try to keep our feet on the ground to some degree when we're using them.

774
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:12,466
因此 当我们使用它们时 我们都必须小心并尽量保持脚踏实地

775
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:16,933
So for example, now I've really only figured this out in the last three months.

776
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:16,933
例如 现在我真的只是在过去三个月里才弄明白这一点

777
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:25,266
I get up and I do a series of exercises that my wife taught me that are based in the Kundalini yoga tradition.

778
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:26,166
我起床后会做一系列我妻子教我的练习 这些练习基于昆达里尼瑜伽传统 非常有帮助

779
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:27,966
That's real helpful, flexibility and breathing exercises.

780
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:33,033
柔韧性和呼吸练习 这可以减少我白天的焦虑 我会说大约减少了25%

781
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:33,033
That reduces my anxiety during the day, I would say about 25%.

782
00:32:33,566 --> 00:32:40,733
然后我会保留一些时间用于写作或从事一些艺术项目

783
00:32:33,566 --> 00:32:40,733
And then I try to reserve some time either for writing or I'm working on a number of artistic projects.

784
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:49,733
所以我会在早上花几个小时做这些事情 然后可能和我妻子散步或吃早餐 我会在这期间吃早餐

785
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:49,733
And so I'm going to do one or those for a couple hours in the morning and then maybe a walk or something with my wife and breakfast, I have breakfast during all this.

786
00:32:50,633 --> 00:32:57,400
然后我可以转向互联世界、电子邮件和播客等等

787
00:32:50,633 --> 00:32:57,400
And then I can turn to the sort of connected world email and the podcasts and so forth.

788
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:02,333
所以隐私和内向隐私之间存在着这种平衡 比方说

789
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:02,333
And so there's this balance between privacy, introverted privacy, let's say,

790
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:06,966
并与除了我妻子之外的所有人断绝联系

791
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:06,966
and disconnect from everyone except for my wife,

792
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,533
然后再有意识地重新连接到虚拟世界

793
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,533
and then a contemplated reconnection with the virtual world.

794
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:15,300
这似乎效果相当不错

795
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:15,300
That seems to be working out pretty well.

796
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:20,966
You wanna get a balance of that that's actually, to use a terrible cliche, sustainable.

797
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:23,300
你想要达到这种平衡 实际上 用一个可怕的陈词滥调来说 是可持续的 对吧 所以你想要努力追求你的项目

798
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,333
So you wanna hit your projects hard,

799
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:31,133
但你必须留出时间来 不是用于娱乐 而是用于文化 因为这两者不是一回事

800
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:31,133
But you have to leave in that, not with entertainment, but with culture, because those are not the same thing.

801
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,033
娱乐是对文化的一种近似

802
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,033
Entertainment is an approximation to culture.

803
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:37,233
And you need to leave in that with culture.

804
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:43,600
你需要用文化来填补它 那是美、戏剧、艺术等等 然后是亲密关系和友谊

805
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,600
That's beauty and drama and art and all of that.

806
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,466
And then with intimate relationships and friendships.

807
00:33:43,633 --> 00:33:47,766
And well, it's very difficult to get the balance of all that correct.

808
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:51,633
而在虚拟环境中很难正确地平衡所有这些 这很难做到

809
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,833
And it's very difficult to do that virtually.

810
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:55,066
So, but I certainly wouldn't forego the technology and neither would the rest of us.

811
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:55,066
但我肯定不会放弃技术 我们其他人也不会

812
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:59,233
It's like people complain about their phones, but they carry them with them everywhere they go.

813
00:33:55,733 --> 00:34:00,966
就像人们抱怨他们的手机 但他们到处都带着它们 对此我并不愤世嫉俗

814
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:00,966
And I'm not cynical about that.

815
00:34:01,066 --> 00:34:02,800
电话不只是电话

816
00:34:01,066 --> 00:34:02,800
The phone, it's not a phone.

817
00:34:03,366 --> 00:34:04,600
天知道它是什么

818
00:34:03,366 --> 00:34:07,233
God only knows what it is, but it's definitely not a phone.

819
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,233
但它绝对不是电话

820
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:17,966
因此 不奇怪的是 既然它刚刚出现而且如此强大 我们不知道如何使用它 甚至可能会毁掉一切

821
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:18,000
And so it's not surprising that since it just appeared and it's so insanely powerful that we don't know what to do with it and that might even wreck everything.

822
00:34:18,066 --> 00:34:18,900
Like God only knows.

823
00:34:18,066 --> 00:34:21,933
就像 只有上帝知道 推特本身就可能让文明停滞不前

824
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:21,600
Twitter itself could bring civilization to a halt.

825
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,766
我们不知道如何应对我们的技术实力带来的意外后果

826
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,766
We don't know how to manage the unintended consequences of our technological prowess.

827
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,333
这正是问题所在

828
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,333
And that's exactly it.

829
00:34:29,766 --> 00:34:34,600
我们经常发明技术 似乎是为了提高效率或增加生产力

830
00:34:29,766 --> 00:34:34,600
It's the, we invent technology often it seems for efficiency or to increase productivity.

831
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:44,066
由于对意外后果可能是什么的无知 提前预测它们几乎是不可能的

832
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:44,066
And it's almost impossible because of that ignorance to what the unintended consequences might be to predict them ahead of time.

833
00:34:44,233 --> 00:34:51,366
所以我们优化——保守派政治哲学的本质学说 对吧 就是要提防意想不到的后果

834
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:51,366
So we optimize- Essential doctrine of conservative political philosophy, right, is beware of unintended consequences.

835
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:54,966
It's like, oh no, this thing will just do what I want it to do and nothing else.

836
00:34:51,566 --> 00:34:54,966
就像 “哦 不 这东西只会按我预期的方式工作 不会有其他结果 ”

837
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,766
就像 不 即使是马克思也知道这不是真的

838
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:58,800
It's like, no, even Marx knew that wasn't true.

839
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,300
马克思发展了异化的概念

840
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,300
Marx developed a concept, the concept of alienation.

841
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,666
你知道 我们会对我们努力的产物感到疏远

842
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,700
We get alienated from the products of our effort.

843
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:08,100
这部分是他不喜欢工厂的原因

844
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:08,100
That's part of the reason he didn't like factories.

845
00:35:10,033 --> 00:35:18,566
公平地说 你知道 因为工厂工作是重复性的 在某种意义上 它破坏了我们与我们生产的产品的手工艺关系

846
00:35:10,033 --> 00:35:18,566
And fair enough, because factory work, which is repetitive, in some sense, destroys our artisanal relationship with what we produce.

847
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:21,700
现在 马克思分析的问题是

848
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:21,700
Now, the problem with Marx's analysis is that,

849
00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:26,900
是的 但这非常高效 并且能够很快地将人们从绝对贫困中解救出来

850
00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:26,900
yeah, but it's pretty damn efficient and it lifts people out of absolute poverty really quickly.

851
00:35:27,766 --> 00:35:35,100
但这并不意味着马克思之后的存在主义哲学家将异化概念发展到相当高的程度

852
00:35:27,766 --> 00:35:35,100
But that doesn't mean that an existential philosophers after Marx developed the concept of alienation to quite a high degree.

853
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:45,066
技术确实因其人造性、冷漠和机械性质使我们感到疏远 所有这些

854
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:45,066
And technology does alienate us because of its artificiality and its coldness and its mechanistic nature, all of that.

855
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,966
嗯 我们必须明智地应对这一切

856
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:51,333
And while we have to contend with that wisely And then you ask, well, how do you contend with things wisely?

857
00:35:48,033 --> 00:35:51,333
然后你会问 怎样才能明智地应对事物？

858
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,100
我会说 不要用欺骗污染你的思想

859
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:54,100
And I would say, well, don't pollute your thoughts with deceit.

860
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:56,566
你妥协了你自己的智慧

861
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:56,566
You compromise your own wisdom.

862
00:35:57,366 --> 00:36:00,833
你将如何做出明智的决策 而不是仅仅是聪明的决策

863
00:35:57,366 --> 00:36:00,833
How are you gonna make intelligent, not intelligent decisions, wise decisions?

864
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:02,033
这就是为什么你不该说谎

865
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:02,033
That's why you shouldn't lie.

866
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,933
就像你在扭曲你在这个世界上的定位机制

867
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,933
It's like you're warping the mechanism that orients you in the world.

868
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:08,266
你真的想这样做吗？

869
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,266
Do you really wanna do that?

870
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,433
这是一个残酷的世界 伙计

871
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,433
This is a brutal world, man.

872
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:12,400
我在我的临床实践中看到了这一点

873
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:12,400
And I've seen this in my clinical practice.

874
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:22,400
那些房子建立在沙子基础上的人 当风开始吹 洪水开始上涨时 他们遇到了如此大的麻烦 非常大的麻烦

875
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:22,400
People whose houses are built on foundations of sand and the wind starts to blow and the floods start to rise and they are in such trouble, such trouble.

876
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:34,433
如果你幸运 当某些可怕的事情来临时 你相对诚实 你的关系处于良好状态 也许你不会落入地狱

877
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:34,433
If you're lucky and something terrible comes your way and you're reasonably honest and your relationships are in good order, maybe you won't end up in hell.

878
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,933
我说的是地狱 我不是说死亡

879
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,933
And I mean hell, I don't mean death.

880
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:43,766
在很多情况下 你可能会让自己陷入这样的境地：甚至死亡都比你正在经历的事情要好得多

881
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:43,766
There's lots of situations you can get yourself in where death would be far preferable to what you're going through.

882
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,433
So you need to be afraid of that.

883
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,466
所以你需要对此感到害怕

884
00:36:47,566 --> 00:36:49,100
It's like, don't lie.

885
00:36:47,566 --> 00:36:49,100
就像 不要说谎

886
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:55,233
In my clinical practice in 20 years, working with every sort of person you could imagine,

887
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:55,233
在我20年的临床实践中 与你能想象的各种人合作

888
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:58,900
I never ever saw anyone get away with anything even once.

889
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:58,900
我从来没有见过有任何人能逃脱惩罚 哪怕一次

890
00:37:00,766 --> 00:37:07,300
So yeah, we're all subject, not least to the judgment of our own conscience.

891
00:37:00,766 --> 00:37:07,300
所以是的 我们所有人都受到至少我们自己良心的审判

892
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:08,900
Try to escape from that.

893
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:08,900
尝试逃避它

894
00:37:10,633 --> 00:37:11,900
No one can escape from that.

895
00:37:10,633 --> 00:37:11,900
但没有人能逃避它

896
00:37:12,266 --> 00:37:14,966
过去两年里 世界经历了这场大流行

897
00:37:12,266 --> 00:37:15,433
Over the last two years, the world has gone through this pandemic.

898
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,033
对很多人来说 这是第一次

899
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,100
for a lot of people, this is the first time,

900
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:27,966
especially for a certain generation, this is the first time they've experienced such unpredictable tectonic destabilization in their lives.

901
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:28,066
对于某一代人来说 这是他们一生中第一次经历如此不可预测的构造性不稳定

902
00:37:28,133 --> 00:37:32,200
Like I didn't even believe society was something that could close.

903
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,200
我甚至不相信社会是可以停滞的

904
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,700
I didn't believe the tech,

905
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,500
我甚至不知道在我的生意下面有构造性的板块 它们可以关闭我的生意 对吗？

906
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,533
I didn't even know there was tectonic plates under my business that could shut down my business, right?

907
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:46,433
And also in your, over the last two years, you've undergone some really, you know, I don't even know what the right adjective is to use to-

908
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:46,633
而且在过去的两年里 你也经历了一些真的 我甚至不知道用什么形容词

909
00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:48,600
构造性这个词还不错

910
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:48,600
Tectonic's not bad.

911
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,100
那我就用构造性吧

912
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,000
We'll go with tectonic then.

913
00:37:50,266 --> 00:37:50,466
Sure.

914
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:58,566
Tectonic, you know, unfortunate challenges, I'll say, in your life, but also, you know, with your family.

915
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:59,266
构造性 你知道 不幸的挑战 我会说在你的生活中 但也 你知道 还有你的家人

916
00:37:59,266 --> 00:38:07,133
What are the lessons we learn from the pandemic and from that type of tectonic suffering about what actually matters in our lives?

917
00:37:59,266 --> 00:38:07,166
我们从这场大流行病和这种结构性的痛苦中学到了哪些关于我们生活中真正重要的事情的教训？

918
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:16,033
好吧 我们会看看大流行的情况 尽管从某种意义上说 它在某些方面已经结束了

919
00:38:07,766 --> 00:38:18,700
Well, we'll see with regard to the pandemic, because although in some sense it is in some ways over, our reaction to it is by no means over.

920
00:38:16,566 --> 00:38:27,733
我们对它的反应还没有结束 我们反应过度的部分原因是 我们天真地对这样的事情没有做好准备

921
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:26,500
And part of the reason that we overreacted, I would say so precipitously to it, is that we were unprepared for such things in our naivety.

922
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:33,900
And then we rushed to imitate a totalitarian society in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic emergence.

923
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:37,566
然后我们在灾难发生后立即急于模仿极权社会 大流行的出现 这是每个人都应该思考的事情

924
00:38:34,366 --> 00:38:36,933
And that's something that everybody should think about a lot.

925
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:40,466
And we're not done with all that totalitarian nonsense yet.

926
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,066
我们还没有结束所有那些极权主义的胡说八道

927
00:38:41,066 --> 00:38:44,400
A lot of that's driven by, well, fear and naivety.

928
00:38:41,066 --> 00:38:44,666
很多这样的情况是由恐惧和天真驱动的

929
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:54,733
I mean, 50% of Democrats in the United States believe you have a 50% chance of being hospitalized with COVID and 25% of Republicans believe the same thing.

930
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:54,800
我的意思是 50%的美国民主党人认为你有50%的机会因COVID而住院 25%的共和党人也有相同的看法

931
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:06,466
And you can point a finger at people and laugh at their ignorance, but you should really ask, well, why is this overestimate of that magnitude and what does that mean in relationship to policy?

932
00:38:54,833 --> 00:39:03,433
你可以指着人们笑他们的无知 但你真的应该问 为什么会有这样的高估？

933
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,466
这对政策有什么意义？

934
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:15,333
And I've had conversations with people advising at the highest level of government, in particularly in Canada, who've told me flat out,

935
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:18,200
我与一些在政府最高层提供建议的人进行了对话 特别是在加拿大 他们直言不讳地告诉我 他们有非常可靠的消息来源

936
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:24,133
and they're very reliable sources, that none of the COVID policy for the last year was driven by reliance on science.

937
00:39:18,866 --> 00:39:24,133
过去一年的COVID政策没有依靠科学

938
00:39:24,733 --> 00:39:26,166
It's all opinion poll.

939
00:39:24,733 --> 00:39:26,166
全都是民意调查

940
00:39:27,066 --> 00:39:28,666
这真的很有害 因为

941
00:39:27,066 --> 00:39:32,600
And that's really pernicious because, well, who's asking the questions and how did they set up the answer?

942
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,600
那么 谁在提出问题 他们是如何设置答案的？

943
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:35,966
And who's answering and in what emotional state?

944
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:35,966
谁在回答 他们处于什么情绪状态

945
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:43,333
And so to what degree are we led by considerations of short-term propitiation of unwarranted fear?

946
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:43,333
那么 我们在多大程度上是被对短期平息无根据恐惧的考虑所引导？

947
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,833
Well, that's no way for free people to live.

948
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,833
这不是自由人民该过的生活方式

949
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:48,366
It certainly won't work in the long run.

950
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:48,366
从长远来看 这肯定行不通

951
00:39:48,500 --> 00:40:01,533
We're already seeing tremendous supply chain disruptions and likely the emergence of an inflationary pressure that we haven't experienced since the 1970s in the aftermath of the oil shocks.

952
00:39:48,500 --> 00:40:01,533
我们已经看到巨大的供应链中断 可能出现自1970年代石油危机之后我们未曾经历过的通胀压力

953
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,233
And none of that has sorted itself out yet.

954
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,233
所有这些还没有解决

955
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:13,166
I believe that we will conclude that our response to the pandemic caused more death and misery than the pandemic itself.

956
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:13,166
我相信我们最终会得出结论 我们对大流行病的反应而造成的死亡和痛苦比大流行病本身还要多

957
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,900
这场游戏还没有结束

958
00:40:14,233 --> 00:40:15,933
And we have no end game in sight.

959
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:21,233
我问与我交谈的人的另一件事是 这件事什么时候结束？

960
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:21,200
Another thing I asked the people that I was speaking with, it's like, when is this over?

961
00:40:22,066 --> 00:40:22,800
Well, we don't know.

962
00:40:22,066 --> 00:40:22,833
嗯 我们不知道

963
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,700
那么 到底会是什么样子呢？

964
00:40:23,433 --> 00:40:24,733
What would over look like?

965
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:26,700
嗯 我们真的不知道

966
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:26,700
Well, we don't really know.

967
00:40:27,366 --> 00:40:35,333
现在你看到的是 几乎每个月都有坚持称出现了一个新的、截然不同的变种

968
00:40:27,366 --> 00:40:35,333
And now what you see is this insistence on about a monthly basis that a new and radically different variant has emerged.

969
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,333
And this virus, viruses mutate all the time, but this virus particularly mutates,

970
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:40,333
这种病毒 病毒一直在变异 但这种病毒特别容易变异

971
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:49,900
and there are small mutations and medium-sized mutations, numbers, let's say, and also effect, and larger scale mutations.

972
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:49,900
有小的变异和中等大小的变异 数量上的 也有影响上的和更大规模的变异

973
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:51,566
When is that a variant?

974
00:40:50,566 --> 00:40:51,600
什么时候算是一个变种？

975
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:55,233
Well, how about whenever it's convenient for the pharmaceutical companies?

976
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:55,233
嗯 是不是最有利于制药公司的时候呢

977
00:40:55,866 --> 00:40:56,900
想想 那是愤世嫉俗的

978
00:40:55,866 --> 00:40:56,933
Think, well, that's cynical.

979
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,066
It's, is it now?

980
00:40:57,533 --> 00:40:58,066
现在是吗？

981
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:07,366
The biggest lawsuits in the history of the American judicial system have been levied against the largest pharmaceutical companies on a regular basis for the last 20 years.

982
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:07,366
过去 20 年来 美国司法系统历史上规模最大的诉讼经常针对最大的制药公司提起

983
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:19,400
And since when has it been a proposition of the political left that pharmaceutical companies necessarily have our best interests in mind?

984
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:19,400
从什么时候 左翼政治人士开始提出制药公司必然考虑到我们的最大利益？

985
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:22,466
Now, I'm not particularly cynical about pharmaceutical companies.

986
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:22,466
现在 我对制药公司并不特别愤世嫉俗

987
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:27,233
I think they have a hard job, both in terms of research and development and marketing and sales.

988
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:27,233
我认为他们的工作很艰难 无论是在研究和开发方面 还是在市场营销和销售方面

989
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,566
And they're going to do what they can to market and sell.

990
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,566
他们会尽力进行市场推广和销售

991
00:41:31,466 --> 00:41:36,666
But that doesn't mean that they are now to be the arbiters of all public policy

992
00:41:31,466 --> 00:41:39,400
但这并不意味着他们现在要成为所有公共政策的仲裁者 因为我们的政治家太懦弱

993
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:45,100
because our politicians are too cowardly and incompetent to do anything but devolve their responsibilities to so-called experts, domain experts.

994
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:44,766
无能到只能将他们的责任推卸给所谓的专家、领域专家

995
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:47,066
Politics is not public health.

996
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:48,733
政治不是公共卫生 那是医学

997
00:41:47,866 --> 00:41:48,733
That's medicine.

998
00:41:49,766 --> 00:41:57,833
Politics is the art of analyzing the entire situation and charting a course forward, all things considered.

999
00:41:49,766 --> 00:41:57,866
政治是一门综合考虑一切因素来分析整个局势并规划前进方向的艺术

1000
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:04,533
And for politicians to trot out the experts and say follow the science just means that they've abdicated their own responsibilities.

1001
00:41:58,533 --> 00:42:04,566
政治家们推出专家并说 “遵循科学” 这意味着他们放弃了自己的责任

1002
00:42:04,933 --> 00:42:06,000
And I think it's appalling.

1003
00:42:04,933 --> 00:42:06,000
我认为这很骇人听闻

1004
00:42:07,033 --> 00:42:11,133
I mean, I'm not convinced that the evidence that masks work is scientifically credible.

1005
00:42:07,033 --> 00:42:11,133
我的意思是 我并不相信口罩有效的证据在科学上是可信的

1006
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,866
It's certainly at least doubtful.

1007
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,866
它至少是值得怀疑的

1008
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,466
And that's just masks.

1009
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,466
而且那只是个口罩

1010
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:23,300
I read a paper the other day suggesting that to prevent the transmission of one case of COVID, you have to lock down a thousand people.

1011
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:23,300
我前几天读到一篇论文 建议为了阻止一例COVID的传播 你必须封锁一千人

1012
00:42:24,266 --> 00:42:26,433
Like how is that justifiable?

1013
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,433
这怎么是合理的呢？

1014
00:42:27,266 --> 00:42:30,300
尤其是考虑到COVID的死亡率实际上相当低

1015
00:42:27,266 --> 00:42:34,000
Especially given that the mortality rate of COVID is actually quite low unless you have a pre-existent health problem, particularly obesity,

1016
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:39,300
除非你有已经存在的健康问题 特别是肥胖 虽然老龄也算作大多数疾病的风险因素 但并非全部

1017
00:42:34,433 --> 00:42:39,300
and although old age also qualifies as it does for most diseases, but not all.

1018
00:42:40,966 --> 00:42:48,600
就儿童疫苗接种问题来说 孩子们死于COVID的几率极低

1019
00:42:40,966 --> 00:42:48,600
And with regards to let's say the issue of child vaccination is like children have an unbelievably tiny chance of dying from COVID.

1020
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:54,300
我认为对12岁以下儿童进行免疫接种没有科学上的正当理由

1021
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:54,300
I don't think there's any scientific justification for immunizing children under 12.

1022
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:02,066
现在 至少这是有争议的 我不是领域专家 虽然我是一个不错的科学家 我知道如何阅读研究材料

1023
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:02,066
Now, at least it's debatable and I'm not a domain expert, although I'm a decent scientist and I know how to read the research material.

1024
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:09,600
And so, well, we'll see what we have to learn from these tectonic shifts underneath.

1025
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:09,633
那么 嗯 我们将看到我们必须从这些结构性变化中学到什么

1026
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:16,000
你可能会问自己 那到底是因为COVID病毒真的非常危险 导致了一次极端物理需求下的结构性变动

1027
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:26,100
And you might ask yourself, well, was that a tectonic shift in dire physical necessity because the COVID virus was genuinely so dangerous or was it an indication tectonically of our absolute inadequacy in the face of even a moderate existential challenge?

1028
00:43:16,066 --> 00:43:27,166
还是这表明了我们在面对即使是中等程度的生存挑战时的绝对不足？

1029
00:43:27,233 --> 00:43:29,333
也许是一点点A列和一点点B列

1030
00:43:27,233 --> 00:43:31,166
And maybe it's a little column A in a little column B, you know, so.

1031
00:43:29,633 --> 00:43:31,133
你知道的 所以

1032
00:43:31,933 --> 00:43:32,866
I have to ask the question,

1033
00:43:31,933 --> 00:43:32,866
我不得不问这个问题

1034
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:39,466
if we were to make Jordan Peterson the president of the world, and these were your decisions to make,

1035
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:39,500
如果我们让乔丹·彼得森成为世界总统 这些决定由你来做

1036
00:43:40,066 --> 00:43:47,200
你知道你会采取什么不同的做法 或者如何应对这种病毒在WH出现的情况？

1037
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:47,266
do you know what you would have done differently, or in response to this virus emerging in Wuhan?

1038
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,700
I would say, well, thank you for the offer, but I declined the position,

1039
00:43:47,866 --> 00:43:50,700
我会说 感谢你的提议 但我拒绝这个职位

1040
00:43:50,766 --> 00:43:59,966
and the reason I would say that is because I think the right solution to the most serious problems is to be found at the level of the individual.

1041
00:43:50,866 --> 00:43:59,766
我之所以这么说 是因为我认为对最严重问题的正确解决方案应该在个人层面找到

1042
00:44:00,033 --> 00:44:05,366
So I don't think if I wanted to pursue what I regarded as the ultimate goal,

1043
00:44:00,033 --> 00:44:05,366
所以我不认为如果我想追求我认为的终极目标

1044
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,800
the ultimate goal for me is the encouragement of the individual.

1045
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,833
对我来说 终极目标是对个人的激励

1046
00:44:10,466 --> 00:44:13,800
And that's not essentially a political enterprise.

1047
00:44:10,466 --> 00:44:13,800
这本质上不是一个政治事业

1048
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,133
It's essentially a theological enterprise.

1049
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,133
这本质上是一个神学事业

1050
00:44:17,633 --> 00:44:19,733
And politics has to be subordinate to that.

1051
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:19,733
政治必须服从于此

1052
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:26,466
所以我在整个人生过程中一直在思考 是否会选择政治职业

1053
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:26,500
And so I've debated throughout the entire course of my life whether I would adopt a political career.

1054
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:30,500
这是我很年轻时的初衷 我会说大约14岁

1055
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,500
was my initial ambition when I was very young 14 I would say

1056
00:44:30,533 --> 00:44:43,633
but when push came to shove at every decision point in my life if I had to choose between working on the encouragement of the individual and pursuing a or pursuing a political career

1057
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:43,633
但是 当我生命中的每个决策点 面临紧要关头时 如果我必须在激励个体还是追求政治生涯之间做出选择

1058
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:51,166
I always chose the the former and that's happened every time the decision has come up

1059
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:51,166
我总是选择前者 每当这个决定出现时都是这样

1060
00:44:51,166 --> 00:45:02,366
I've been approached by people in Canada to involve myself more deeply in a practical role and also publicly as a political figure

1061
00:44:51,233 --> 00:45:06,133
加拿大的一些人接触过我 希望我更深入地参与现实角色 作为一个公众政治人物 但我更愿意做我现在的事

1062
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:15,100
but I'd rather do what I'm doing I'm in contact with people working politically all the time both on the people in the middle people on the right people on the left

1063
00:45:06,133 --> 00:45:14,900
我一直与政治工作的人保持联系 包括中间派、右派和左派的人

1064
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:28,133
I'm agnostic about that because I know full well that conservatives have something to say and left-leaning liberals have something to say that's basically predicated to some degree on their temperament

1065
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:28,133
我对此持不置可否的态度 因为我很清楚保守派和左倾的自由派都有话要说

1066
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:43,266
so conservatives tend to be more conscientious so that's orderly and industrious dutiful patriotic willing to make and keep verbal contracts reliable capable of implementation at the level of detail

1067
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:43,266
这在某种程度上基于他们的性格 保守派倾向于更有责任心 也就是有序和勤奋、尽职、爱国、愿意制定并遵守口头合约、可靠 能够在细节层面上执行。

1068
00:45:43,266 --> 00:45:50,166
that's kind of conservative virtues there but they tend to be lower in creativity openness to experience they don't think is divergent Lee

1069
00:45:43,266 --> 00:45:50,166
这些是保守派的美德 但他们往往在创造力、对经验的开放性方面较低

1070
00:45:50,200 --> 00:46:00,400
他们的思维不那么发散 他们的责任心往往限制了他们的创造力,而自由派类型 他们在对经验的开放性方面得分高

1071
00:45:50,200 --> 00:46:00,600
and their conscientiousness tends to constrain their creativity whereas the liberal types they're high in openness to experience that's the creativity dimension

1072
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:06,733
这是创造力维度 但他们在责任心方面 特别是有序性方面 得分较低

1073
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:06,733
but they tend to be lower in conscientiousness particularly orderliness and so what that means is

1074
00:46:06,733 --> 00:46:15,566
这意味着 具有自由派性格的人倾向于成为创意人/企业家 而具有保守性格的人倾向于成为管理和行政人员

1075
00:46:06,733 --> 00:46:15,566
those with a liberal temperament tend to be creative slash entrepreneurs and those with a conservative temperament tend to be managerial and administrative

1076
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,566
这并不意味着他们不能经营企业

1077
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,566
that doesn't mean they can't run businesses well you want a conservative person to run your business

1078
00:46:21,633 --> 00:46:29,633
嗯 你可能希望一个保守的人来经营你的企业 你可能想要一个更自由派的人给你提供一些天马行空的想法

1079
00:46:21,633 --> 00:46:29,633
you might want a more liberal person to pepper you with off-the-wall ideas you know and then if you're gonna run an enterprise

1080
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:39,100
然后 如果你要运营一个企业、商业或社会 就必须有不同性格的人之间的持续对话 这样我们才能保持国家船只 比方说

1081
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:39,100
business or a society there has to be a continual dialogue between people of different temperaments so that we can keep the ship of state let's say

1082
00:46:39,566 --> 00:46:44,466
朝着一个不断变化的目的地前进 这就是为什么自由言论如此必要

1083
00:46:39,566 --> 00:46:44,466
tracking to an ever-moving destination that's why free speech is so necessary

1084
00:46:44,933 --> 00:46:50,266
it's not another right it's the right so because none of us know what's going

1085
00:46:44,933 --> 00:46:55,266
这不仅仅是另一个权利 它是权利之本 因为我们谁也不知道归根结底会发生什么 因为未来确实与过去不同

1086
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:55,266
on in the final analysis because the future is different than the past really

1087
00:46:56,033 --> 00:47:05,566
we have to talk about what to do all the time because even if we made wise decisions in the past that doesn't mean that we can mindlessly replicate those

1088
00:46:56,033 --> 00:47:10,633
我们必须一直讨论该做什么 因为即使我们过去做出了明智的决定 这并不意味着我们现在可以不假思索地复制这些决定 来应对变化的未来

1089
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:10,633
decisions right now in the present to deal with a changing future

1090
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:18,100
所以我想帮助鼓励人们成为能够参与自由对话的人

1091
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:18,100
so I want to help encourage people to become the sort of people who can engage in that free dialogue

1092
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:22,800
我认为这是向前迈进的最好方式 特别是当我们所有人都变得更加技术强大时

1093
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:22,800
and I think that's the best way forward especially as we all become more technologically powerful

1094
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:30,766
it's like you better be smart enough to use your iPhone and that's pretty damn smart let's say wise because that's no trivial gadget

1095
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:30,766
就像 你最好足够聪明地使用你的iPhone 那是相当聪明的 可以说是明智的 因为那不是一个微不足道的小玩意儿

1096
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:36,900
and if you're not careful with it it will turn on you we'll build

1097
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:53,566
如果你不小心 它就会攻击你 例如 我们会在我们的人工智能系统中构建专制的假设 然后看看情况会怎样 所以如果你要拥有一颗氢弹 你最好足够明智地使用它

1098
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:53,566
authoritarian presumptions into our artificial intelligence systems for example and then look the hell out so if you're gonna have a hydrogen bomb you

1099
00:47:54,833 --> 00:48:00,433
在激励个体这一点上 我们生命中都有我们想要鼓励的人 我们希望如此

1100
00:47:54,833 --> 00:48:00,433
better be wise enough to wield it on that point of the encouragement of the individual we all have people in our lives that we want to encourage we hope

1101
00:48:00,866 --> 00:48:09,933
是的 我们希望 对吧？我们有时会试图强加我们自己的偏见、我们自己对他们的意图

1102
00:48:00,866 --> 00:48:13,366
yeah we hope right and we sometimes fall foul of trying to force our own bias our own intention for them on them what is the best way if I've got a friend in my or a partner that I want to encourage

1103
00:48:09,933 --> 00:48:19,533
如果我生命中有一个朋友或伴侣 我想鼓励他们从绝望的地方走向更好的地方

1104
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:19,533
to come out of their place of despair into a better place,

1105
00:48:19,966 --> 00:48:25,133
我该如何有效地做到这一点 而不是压倒他们或扼杀他们 或让他们感到不足

1106
00:48:19,966 --> 00:48:25,133
how do I effectively do that without overpowering them or stifling them or making them feel inadequate,

1107
00:48:25,533 --> 00:48:29,466
这有时是试图改变所爱之人的后果

1108
00:48:25,533 --> 00:48:29,466
which is sometimes the consequence of trying to change someone you love?

1109
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,600
好吧 以身作则是个好方法

1110
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,600
Well, example's good,

1111
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:41,333
但我想说的是 不要再误以为你知道什么对这个人来说是最好的

1112
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:41,333
but then I would say disabuse yourself of the notion that you know what is best for this person.

1113
00:48:42,033 --> 00:48:47,000
你不知道 不仅你不知道 你实际上不想承担那种责任 有两个原因

1114
00:48:42,033 --> 00:48:47,000
You don't, not only do you not know, you actually don't want that responsibility for two reasons.

1115
00:48:48,233 --> 00:48:52,100
比如说 他们按照你的说法行事 对他们有好处

1116
00:48:48,233 --> 00:48:52,100
Let's say they do what you say and something good happens to them.

1117
00:48:53,066 --> 00:48:54,100
那么 这是谁的胜利？

1118
00:48:53,066 --> 00:48:54,100
Well, whose victory is that?

1119
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:56,166
是你的还是他们的？

1120
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:56,166
Yours or theirs?

1121
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,300
如果是你的 你是不是刚好偷走了它？

1122
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,300
And if it's yours, did you just steal it?

1123
00:48:59,633 --> 00:49:02,666
然后假设他们按照你的建议 失败了

1124
00:48:59,633 --> 00:49:02,666
And then let's say they fail following your advice.

1125
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,533
好吧 他们为此付出了代价

1126
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,533
Well, they pay the price for that.

1127
00:49:06,366 --> 00:49:09,900
你可以愉快地跳开说 嗯 我应该说得更谨慎一些

1128
00:49:06,366 --> 00:49:09,900
And you can skip away merrily and say, well, I should have spoke more carefully.

1129
00:49:10,433 --> 00:49:12,766
就像 你不要干涉人们的命运

1130
00:49:10,433 --> 00:49:12,766
It's like, you don't mess about with people's destiny.

1131
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,300
你不知道他们要去哪里

1132
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,300
You do not know where they're headed.

1133
00:49:14,733 --> 00:49:16,266
Now, having said that,

1134
00:49:14,733 --> 00:49:20,433
既然如此 你就继续做这个采访中你正在做的事 在这个播客中

1135
00:49:17,533 --> 00:49:20,433
you do what you're doing in this interview, in this podcast.

1136
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,433
你问人们问题 真正的问题 你知道吗？

1137
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,433
You ask people questions, real questions, you know?

1138
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:26,233
比如 你感觉怎么样？

1139
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:26,233
Like, how are you feeling?

1140
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,766
哦 我今天感觉不太好

1141
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,766
Oh, I'm not doing so good today.

1142
00:49:28,866 --> 00:49:31,266
那 怎么了？

1143
00:49:28,866 --> 00:49:31,266
Well, you know, what's up?

1144
00:49:31,733 --> 00:49:32,366
发生了什么事？

1145
00:49:31,733 --> 00:49:32,366
What's going on?

1146
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:40,733
你不能想 好吧 我要问问题来引导这个人往特定的方向发展 因为那是同样的游戏 同样的工具性游戏

1147
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:40,733
And you can't think, well, I'm gonna ask questions to lead this person in a particular direction, because that's the same game, the same instrumental game.

1148
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,300
你必须看看你想知道什么

1149
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,300
You have to see what it is that you want to know.

1150
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:49,033
Because I see this when people ask me questions after my lectures, you know, now and then,

1151
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:53,366
因为 看 当人们在我的讲座后问我问题 你知道 偶尔 或者在问答环节 偶尔人们会起来提一个真正的问题

1152
00:49:49,933 --> 00:49:53,366
or during a Q&A, now and then people get up and they'll ask a real question.

1153
00:49:53,433 --> 00:49:55,000
它是持续对话的一部分

1154
00:49:53,433 --> 00:49:55,000
It's part of the ongoing dialogue.

1155
00:49:55,366 --> 00:49:56,166
某些事情触动了他们

1156
00:49:55,366 --> 00:49:56,166
Something struck them.

1157
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,133
他们站起来

1158
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,133
They stand up.

1159
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:58,500
他们真的想知道某件事

1160
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:58,500
There's something they really want to know.

1161
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,933
这是一个诚实的问题

1162
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,933
It's an honest question.

1163
00:50:00,533 --> 00:50:04,266
And that goes real well, but not infrequently.

1164
00:50:00,533 --> 00:50:09,066
而这很好 但不时地 有人站起来 带着一个小小的准备好的讲话 将其包装成一个问题

1165
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,066
someone stands up with a little prepared speech that's packaged as a question.

1166
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,400
这些人中很多都是基督教传统主义者

1167
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,400
So I get this from Christian traditionalists fairly frequently.

1168
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:21,866
他们站起来问我关于我的宗教信仰 但实际上他们想做的是逼我承认 我应该接受耶稣基督作为我的救世主

1169
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:21,866
They get up and they ask me about my religious convictions, but really what they wanna do is corner me into admitting that I should accept Jesus Christ as my savior and join a particular,

1170
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,333
并加入一个特定的 比如说 教派

1171
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,333
let's say, denomination.

1172
00:50:25,866 --> 00:50:26,633
这不是一个问题

1173
00:50:25,866 --> 00:50:26,633
It's not a question.

1174
00:50:28,133 --> 00:50:29,266
这只是一种操纵

1175
00:50:28,133 --> 00:50:29,266
It's just a manipulation.

1176
00:50:30,433 --> 00:50:35,200
所以你的问题 像你的陈述一样 你的问题应该是诚实的

1177
00:50:30,433 --> 00:50:35,200
And so your questions, like your statements, your question should be honest.

1178
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:41,333
如果你问人们问题并且真的倾听 他们会自己解开纠结

1179
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:41,333
And if you ask people questions and you really listen, they will untangle themselves.

1180
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,466
这也是部分原因 为什么人们喜欢被关注 你知道 像

1181
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,466
And that's partly why people love to be attended to.

1182
00:50:44,733 --> 00:50:52,666
如果我在街上遇到人 你知道 我会问他们的名字

1183
00:50:44,733 --> 00:50:52,666
You know, like if I meet people on the street, you know, I ask them their name,

1184
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,600
当他们走近我时 他们通常都很慌乱 他们并不是真的想打扰我 所有他们就很慌张

1185
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,600
they're all usually flustered when they come up to me, they don't really want to interrupt me and then they're flustered.

1186
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:01,566
我做的第一件事就是握他们的手 问他们的名字

1187
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:01,566
And the first thing I do is shake their hand and ask them their name.

1188
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:08,333
我记不太住名字 但我会听 他们知道如何说出自己的名字

1189
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:08,333
And I listen, I'm not that good at remembering names, but I listen to it. and they know how to say their name.

1190
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:12,833
所以这会让他们平静下来 然后它某种程度上将他们作为一个人从背景中标记出来 是吧？（译注：在某种程度上将他们作为一个独特的个体与背景区分开来 这种互动帮助人们感到被重视和被认可 而不只是在人群中混为一谈）

1191
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:12,833
And so it kind of settles them down and then it sort of marks them out as a person against the background, eh?

1192
00:51:13,733 --> 00:51:19,900
然后如果我关注他们 倾听 他们会在大概10秒内告诉我我需要知道的东西

1193
00:51:13,733 --> 00:51:19,900
And then if I pay attention to them and listen, they will tell me something in like 10 seconds that I need to know.

1194
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,733
因为他们有话要说

1195
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,733
Because they have something to say, you know?

1196
00:51:23,966 --> 00:51:29,033
然后 如果你倾听 人们会告诉你他们要说什么 然后你就会变得明智 因为你收集了所有这些

1197
00:51:23,966 --> 00:51:29,033
And then if you listen, people tell you what they have to say and then you get wise because you collect all that.

1198
00:51:29,866 --> 00:51:31,266
所以你想帮助某人

1199
00:51:29,866 --> 00:51:31,266
And so you want to help someone.

1200
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:37,566
首先 你会决定你的目标是帮助 对吧？

1201
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:37,566
Well, first of all, you would decide that you're aiming towards help, right?

1202
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:41,133
而你以无知的精神去做这件事

1203
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:41,133
And that you do that in the spirit of ignorance.

1204
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,233
每个优秀的临床医生都会学到的就是 我不知道你要去哪里

1205
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,233
This is what every good clinician learns is I don't know where you're headed.

1206
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,533
我不知道你哪里不对劲

1207
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,533
I don't know what's wrong with you.

1208
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,700
这是个难题 伙计

1209
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,700
This is a hard problem, man.

1210
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,933
就像 你的问题是什么？

1211
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,933
It's like, what's your problem?

1212
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:50,900
我不知道你的问题是什么

1213
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:50,900
I don't know what your problem is.

1214
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:56,100
所以我们首先找出这个 然后我们找出一个你可以问人们的问题

1215
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:56,100
So let's find that out first and then let's find out one thing you can ask people.

1216
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:58,566
This is actually useful in an argument with someone you love.

1217
00:51:56,166 --> 00:52:00,233
这实际上在与你爱的人争论时很有用 他们对你不满

1218
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,200
They're upset with you.

1219
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,266
你对满意的前提条件是什么？

1220
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,266
What are your preconditions for satisfaction?

1221
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,833
现在 我不会这样表达

1222
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,833
Now, I wouldn't state it like that.

1223
00:52:06,966 --> 00:52:14,000
就像 如果我现在能在这场争论的背景下给你想要的东西 并且我不是以一种操纵的方式这样做

1224
00:52:06,966 --> 00:52:14,000
It's like, if I could give you what you wanted right now in the context of this argument, and I wasn't doing it in a manipulative way,

1225
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,700
我需要说什么或做什么才能原则上让你满意？

1226
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,700
what is it that I would have to say or do that would in principle satisfy you?

1227
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,566
这是个难题 你知道的

1228
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,566
And that's a hard question, you know?

1229
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:30,433
那人可能会说 嗯 我认为你应该为这个道歉 然后我会说 我应该用什么话来说？

1230
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:30,433
And the person might say, well, I think you should apologize about this, and then I will say, what words should I use?

1231
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,866
他们会说 嗯 如果你爱我 你就会知道

1232
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,866
And they'll say, well, if you loved me, you'd know.

1233
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:41,333
我会说 不 我愚蠢又无知

1234
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:41,333
And I would say, no, I'm stupid and ignorant and I don't know what the right words are to satisfy you.

1235
00:52:41,466 --> 00:52:50,200
我不知道用什么正确的话来满足你 那你为什么不帮帮我 我会笨拙而不优雅地说出来 以一种真诚的行动表达我的和平承诺

1236
00:52:41,466 --> 00:52:50,200
So why don't you give me a hand with that and I'll utter them in elegantly and awkwardly in a good faith demonstration of my commitment to peace.

1237
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:57,666
这可能不够好 因为如果是我自己想出来的话可能会更好 但也许下次我可以做得稍微好一点

1238
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:57,666
And that won't be so good because maybe it would have been better if I came up with it myself, but maybe next time I can do slightly better.

1239
00:52:59,033 --> 00:53:07,466
这是有效的 这要求追问你的人仔细思考

1240
00:52:59,033 --> 00:53:07,466
And that works, it requires the person who's after you to think through the question even of

1241
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:12,033
甚至是否有任何可以说出或做出的事情能使他们满意

1242
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:12,033
whether there's anything that could be said or done that would satisfy them.

1243
00:53:12,466 --> 00:53:13,833
And if the answer to that is no,

1244
00:53:12,466 --> 00:53:16,266
如果答案是否定的 那么 这段关系可能就结束了

1245
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:16,233
well, probably the relationship is over.

1246
00:53:16,933 --> 00:53:23,433
但肯定的是 被他们指责的那个人被置于了一个绝对不可能的位置

1247
00:53:16,933 --> 00:53:23,433
But certainly the person that they're accusing has been put in an absolutely impossible position.

1248
00:53:24,366 --> 00:53:30,400
但通常 几乎不可避免地 如果那个人稍微沉思一下

1249
00:53:24,366 --> 00:53:30,400
But usually, almost inevitably, if the person meditates on it for a bit,

1250
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:39,400
确实有一些事情可以让他们满意 可以通过谈判解决 只要他们愿意给你机会去做 你知道 愚蠢而糟糕地去做

1251
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:39,400
there is something that would satisfy them that can be negotiated as long as they're willing to give you the opportunity to do it stupidly and badly.

1252
00:53:40,466 --> 00:53:42,366
所以 倾听 伙计

1253
00:53:40,466 --> 00:53:42,366
So, listening, man.

1254
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,600
我两周前和吉米·卡尔谈过 那位著名的喜剧演员 是的 那次谈话真的很有趣

1255
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,600
Jimmy Carr, I talked to Jimmy Carr two weeks ago, the famous comedian, yeah, it was real interesting.

1256
00:53:49,933 --> 00:53:55,566
他说喜剧是娱乐领域中最对话式的

1257
00:53:49,933 --> 00:53:55,566
He said comedy is the most dialogical of the entertainment forums.

1258
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:57,300
And I thought, well, what do you mean by that?

1259
00:53:55,933 --> 00:54:00,066
我当时想 你这么说是什么意思 因为你只是在说 这是一段独白 对吧？

1260
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,066
Because you're just, it's a monologue, right?

1261
00:54:00,666 --> 00:54:03,133
现在我做独白 但我会注意观众

1262
00:54:00,666 --> 00:54:03,133
Now I do monologues, but I pay attention to the audience.

1263
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:08,966
我总是和观众中的个别人交谈 观察他们的反应 听整个观众的反应

1264
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:08,966
I'm always talking to individual people in the audience and watching their reactions and listening to the audience as a whole.

1265
00:54:09,566 --> 00:54:12,533
所以即使这是一场讲座 比方说 或者是一次谈话

1266
00:54:09,566 --> 00:54:12,533
So even though it's a lecture, let's say, or a talk,

1267
00:54:14,066 --> 00:54:16,166
I'm watching the audience and responding.

1268
00:54:14,066 --> 00:54:17,433
我观察着观众并作出回应 所以我们处于一种舞蹈中

1269
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,400
So we're in a kind of dance.

1270
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:26,666
卡尔指出 喜剧演员在他们上路之前 这几乎总是这样 他们有他们的新节目

1271
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:26,666
Well, Carr pointed out that comedians, before they hit the road, and this is virtually invariably the case, they have their new routines.

1272
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,200
So they're corpus of potentially funny jokes.

1273
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:34,933
他们有可能有趣的笑话的语料库 然后他们做了200场演出

1274
00:54:31,966 --> 00:54:34,933
And then they do 200 shows in front of small audiences.

1275
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:39,033
在小型观众面前 观众要么笑要么不笑 如果你在听 你就会收集所有让人们笑的笑话

1276
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:39,033
And the audience either laughs or doesn't.

1277
00:54:39,933 --> 00:54:43,966
And if you're listening, you collect all the jokes that people laugh at.

1278
00:54:39,933 --> 00:54:48,933
如果你倾听 你会收集到所有引发观众为之而笑的笑话 如果你这样做了200次 你就会拥有你所听到的全部的笑话 但你需要倾听

1279
00:54:44,366 --> 00:54:48,933
If you do that 200 times, you have nothing but hilarious material, but you listened.

1280
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,133
然后你就可以出门上路了

1281
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,133
And then you can go out on the road.

1282
00:54:51,266 --> 00:54:56,500
这对我来说非常有趣 因为幽默是一个在体验上和概念上都很神秘的现象

1283
00:54:51,266 --> 00:54:56,500
and that was very interesting to me because humor is a mysterious phenomenon

1284
00:54:57,133 --> 00:55:05,300
它在某种程度上是先于认知和本能的 但它也极其复杂 然后它还有一种超越性 对吧

1285
00:54:57,133 --> 00:55:05,300
experientially and conceptually and it's sort of precognitive and instinctual but it's also extremely sophisticated then there's an element of transcendence about it, right?

1286
00:55:05,366 --> 00:55:09,666
因为你可以嘲笑自己 而那在某种意义上是最高形式的幽默

1287
00:55:05,366 --> 00:55:09,666
Because you can laugh at yourself and that's in some sense the highest form of humor.

1288
00:55:10,666 --> 00:55:19,100
所以很有趣的是我们可以在批评和提升自己的同时发现这是极其愉快的

1289
00:55:10,666 --> 00:55:19,100
And so it's so interesting that we can criticize and elevate ourselves at the same time and that we find that intensely pleasurable.

1290
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:25,200
所以一个好的喜剧演员通过这种方式进行收集 与观众分享 他在听

1291
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:25,200
And so a good comedian collects ways to do that, shares them with the audience and he's listening.

1292
00:55:25,566 --> 00:55:33,766
所以如果你想帮助某人 帮助某人的最佳方式不是给他们建议 而是倾听他们

1293
00:55:25,566 --> 00:55:33,766
And so if you want to help someone, the best way to help someone is not to give them advice, but to listen to them, so.

1294
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:38,833
我实际上在吉米·卡尔之前有位客人来参加了这个播客

1295
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:38,833
I had a guest actually come on this podcast before Jimmy Carr.

1296
00:55:39,033 --> 00:55:44,100
吉米·卡尔两周前上节目 我们进行了一场关于幸福及其本质的精彩对话

1297
00:55:39,033 --> 00:55:44,100
Jimmy Carr was on two weeks ago and we had a great conversation about happiness and the nature of happiness.

1298
00:55:44,233 --> 00:55:50,366
而吉米·卡尔之前的那位客人在我的日记本上写下了一个问题 这是我们现在有的一个传统 所有来上节目的客人都会为下一位客人写一个问题

1299
00:55:44,233 --> 00:55:50,366
And the guest before Jimmy Carr wrote in my diary, which is a tradition we have now where all the guests that come on write a question for the next guest.

1300
00:55:50,433 --> 00:55:51,466
所以这里有一个问题是给你的

1301
00:55:50,433 --> 00:55:51,466
So there is a question there for you.

1302
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,600
但那位客人写下了一个改变了他生活的问题 那就是 你幸福吗？

1303
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,600
But the guest wrote a question which changed his life, which is, are you happy?

1304
00:55:58,166 --> 00:56:04,666
通过阅读你的作品并理解你对幸福的立场 以及幸福不是追求目标这一点 这真的打动了我

1305
00:55:58,166 --> 00:56:04,666
And I, from reading your work and understanding your position on happiness and it not being the thing to aim for, which really struck me because I thought, you know,

1306
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,200
因为我曾以为 生活的北极星是试着去寻求幸福

1307
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,200
I thought life was the North Star of our lives was to try and be happy.

1308
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,300
我想我的问题是我本来想问你那个问题

1309
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,300
I guess my question is, what, I was gonna ask you that question.

1310
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:15,300
追求做一个好人 并为幸福祈祷

1311
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:15,300
Aim to be good and pray for happiness.

1312
00:56:16,366 --> 00:56:21,933
所以我想问的问题基本上是 如果我关心你的话 我问你什么问题更好？

1313
00:56:16,366 --> 00:56:21,933
So the question I was gonna, it was pretty much that, is what is a better question for me to ask you if I'm checking in on you,

1314
00:56:22,266 --> 00:56:24,300
因为我们出于好意提出那个问题

1315
00:56:22,266 --> 00:56:24,300
because we asked that question with good intentions.

1316
00:56:24,766 --> 00:56:25,400
你幸福吗？

1317
00:56:24,766 --> 00:56:25,400
Are you happy?

1318
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:28,166
那么 有什么更好的问题可以问乔丹·彼得森

1319
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:28,166
What's a better question for me to ask Jordan Peterson?

1320
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:29,666
你过得怎么样？

1321
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:29,666
How are you doing?

1322
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:30,966
你过得怎么样？

1323
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:30,966
How are you doing?

1324
00:56:32,066 --> 00:56:32,533
你过得怎么样？

1325
00:56:32,066 --> 00:56:32,533
How are you doing?

1326
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,533
灿烂且糟糕

1327
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,533
Brilliantly and terribly.

1328
00:56:50,166 --> 00:57:08,766
这就像 你知道 当你听一首深刻的音乐作品时 一首涵盖整个情感体验的作品 它不是快乐的

1329
00:56:50,166 --> 00:57:08,766
That's, you know, when you listen to a profound piece of music, one that sort of spans the whole emotional experience, it's not happy.

1330
00:57:09,666 --> 00:57:11,200
快乐是电梯音乐（译注：电梯音乐 通常指那种在商业场所如购物中心、酒店、电梯等背景播放的轻柔、中性、不具侵扰性的音乐 电梯音乐通常节奏平缓、旋律简单 不包含太多情感表达 因而有时被用来形容那些过于平淡、缺乏特色的音乐作品 ）

1331
00:57:09,666 --> 00:57:11,200
Happy is elevator music.

1332
00:57:11,366 --> 00:57:14,400
但可能你根本就不应该听那种音乐

1333
00:57:11,366 --> 00:57:14,400
And probably you just shouldn't listen to that at all.

1334
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:16,800
对吧 你想 为什么？

1335
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:16,800
Right, and you think, why?

1336
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:21,300
嗯 它无害 它轻薄 它甜蜜

1337
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:21,300
Well, it's harmless, it's treetally, it's sweet.

1338
00:57:23,466 --> 00:57:26,166
简单 缺乏深度 它浅薄 这是个问题

1339
00:57:23,466 --> 00:57:26,166
Simple, it lacks depth, it's shallow, that's a problem.

1340
00:57:31,533 --> 00:57:34,800
它没有那种深沉的敬畏和恐怖感

1341
00:57:31,533 --> 00:57:34,800
It doesn't have that deep sense of awe and horror,

1342
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:39,566
我会说 这是所有最佳音乐的特征

1343
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:39,566
I would say, that is characteristic of the best of all music.

1344
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,466
你知道 你听一些简单的音乐 所谓的

1345
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,466
You know, you listen to some simple music, so-called.

1346
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,400
汉克·威廉姆斯就是一个很好的例子

1347
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,400
Hank Williams is a good example.

1348
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:53,166
你知道 那位五十年代的布鲁斯牛仔 他27岁因酗酒去世 他的声音听起来像一个80岁的老人

1349
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:53,166
You know, the blues cowboy from the fifties who died of alcoholism when he was 27 and whose voice sounds like an 80 year old man.

1350
00:57:54,333 --> 00:58:01,066
旋律很简单 但是歌曲和声音一点也不简单

1351
00:57:54,333 --> 00:58:01,066
Simple melody, you know, but there's nothing simple in the song and in the voice.

1352
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,933
它深刻 就像布鲁斯

1353
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,933
It's deep, you know, it's like the blues.

1354
00:58:04,733 --> 00:58:06,900
就像二十年代美国的黑人布鲁斯

1355
00:58:04,733 --> 00:58:06,900
It's like black blues in the States from the twenties.

1356
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:09,000
这显然是受到那个传统的影响

1357
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:09,000
And this was certainly influenced by that tradition.

1358
00:58:10,966 --> 00:58:21,866
这是对深刻苦难的承认 同时你感受到音乐的美妙超越

1359
00:58:10,966 --> 00:58:21,866
There's this admission of a deep suffering at the same time as you get the beautiful transcendence of the music.

1360
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:35,366
这意味着 你知道 从最根本的意义上来说 这很可怕 但是你需要一种痛苦的解药

1361
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:35,366
And that's meaning, you know, that's awful in the most fundamental sense, but you need an antidote to suffering and it has to be deep.

1362
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:39,500
它必须是深刻的 深刻地感动你的构造 这不是一件微不足道的事情

1363
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:39,500
And deep moves you tectonically, and it's not a trivial thing.

1364
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,466
但那比幸福更好

1365
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,466
But that's better than happiness.

1366
00:58:43,866 --> 00:58:52,300
也许如果你幸运 在你追求它和沉浸其中时 你会感到快乐 当这发生时你应该跪下来感激

1367
00:58:43,866 --> 00:58:52,300
And maybe if you're lucky, while you're pursuing that, and while you're immersed in it, you get to be happy, and you should fall on your knees and be grateful for that when it happens.

1368
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,300
你知道 这是一份礼物

1369
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,300
You know, it's a gift.

1370
00:58:53,933 --> 00:58:54,766
It really is a gift.

1371
00:58:53,933 --> 00:58:58,000
这真的是一份礼物 它出乎意料地降临于你 那就是你的幸福

1372
00:58:55,533 --> 00:58:58,033
And it comes upon you unexpectedly, your happiness, you know?

1373
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:04,766
但是你的目标是攀登至你能想象到的最高峰

1374
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:04,766
But you aim to climb uphill to the highest peak you can possibly envision.

1375
00:59:05,866 --> 00:59:08,033
这比幸福更重要

1376
00:59:05,866 --> 00:59:08,033
And that's better than happiness.

1377
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,200
你为什么要包括“糟糕”这个词呢？

1378
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,200
Why did you include terribly?

1379
00:59:14,366 --> 00:59:16,233
Well, for example, now, when I go,

1380
00:59:14,366 --> 00:59:26,900
比如现在 当我去世界上任何地方 人们走近我 我不会说他们见到我很高兴 他们经常是含泪的

1381
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,233
wherever I go in the world, people come up to me and they're usually, I wouldn't say they're happy to see me.

1382
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,900
They're often in tears, you know?

1383
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,200
并且他们经常会讲述一个相当艰难的故事

1384
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,200
And they often have a pretty rough story to relate.

1385
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:41,600
他们可能曾经想过自杀、虚无主义或者有杀人的念头 或者束缚、绝望 他们很快就会告诉我这一切

1386
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:41,600
You know, they were suicidal or nihilistic or homicidal are trapped, desperate, you know, and they tell me that real fast.

1387
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,900
然后他们说 我在很大程度上克服了这些 感谢你的帮助

1388
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,900
And then they say, I've overcome that to a large degree and thank you for that.

1389
00:59:48,266 --> 00:59:52,566
你会想 这样的事情一次又一次地发生真是太了不起了

1390
00:59:48,266 --> 00:59:52,566
And you think, well, that's really something to have that happen over and over.

1391
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,733
In some ways you might think, well, how could anything better possibly happen to you

1392
00:59:53,400 --> 01:00:03,033
在某些方面 你可能会想 还有什么比全世界的陌生人这样走近你 如此快速地像老朋友一样敞开心扉而更好的事情呢？但同时这也是一件可怕的事情

1393
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:03,033
than to have people come up to you all over the world, strangers, and open themselves up like that, like they're old friends so quickly.

1394
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:14,133
因为即使在他们胜利的启示中 你也能看到他们最初的绝望的深度

1395
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:14,133
But at the same time, it's an awful thing because you see, even in the revelation of their triumph, the initial depth of their despair.

1396
01:00:19,733 --> 01:00:23,400
So I wouldn't change that, but it's not nothing.

1397
01:00:19,733 --> 01:00:30,233
所以我无法改变这一点 但这并非无关紧要 它当然不仅仅是幸福 它比幸福更好 但它几乎难以承担

1398
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,133
It's certainly not just happiness.

1399
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,233
It's better than happiness, but it's almost unbearable.

1400
01:00:44,366 --> 01:00:45,800
再次泪流

1401
01:00:44,366 --> 01:00:45,800
God, tears again.

1402
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,333
在英国的这两周真是难以置信

1403
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,333
It's been quite two weeks in the UK.

1404
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,766
这真是太棒了

1405
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,766
It's been amazing.

1406
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,166
这真是太棒了

1407
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,166
It's been amazing.

1408
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,000
这个国家真是太伟大了

1409
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,000
Such a great country, this country.

1410
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,533
这是一个如此深刻的地方

1411
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,533
Such a profound place.

1412
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:08,166
能够见到剑桥和牛津 被学生们欢迎 真是太美妙了

1413
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:08,166
And it was so wonderful to see Cambridge and Oxford and to be welcomed by the students.

1414
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:11,600
我看到围绕街区的长队和你得到的反应

1415
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:11,600
I saw the cues around the block and the reaction you got.

1416
01:01:11,633 --> 01:01:18,266
我在剑桥看了你的演讲 能看到这一点真是太好了 因为我知道 你做你所做的事并非为了获得认可

1417
01:01:11,633 --> 01:01:18,266
I watched the talk in Cambridge and it was so wonderful to see because I know that you don't do what you do for credit.

1418
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:24,633
那完全相反于 追求你的真理 并以真理为目标

1419
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:24,633
That kind of seems to be the antithesis of pursuing your truth and doing it in the cause of truth.

1420
01:01:24,733 --> 01:01:31,033
但看到一个我知道对这么多人产生了如此深远影响的人以这种方式被接纳 真是太美妙了

1421
01:01:24,733 --> 01:01:31,033
But it was so wonderful to see someone that I know has had such a profound impact on so many be received in such a way.

1422
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,900
我们有一个结束传统

1423
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,900
We have a closing tradition.

1424
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:40,733
我不想这样做 但我们国家一位真正伟大的年轻CEO 昨天坐在这里 他创办了一家价值数十亿美元的公司 真是个了不起的家伙

1425
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:40,733
One of the, you know, I don't want to do this, but one of the really great CEOs in our country, a young guy who's bought a multi-billion dollar company, really great guy, sat here yesterday.

1426
01:01:40,733 --> 01:01:43,000
实际上我第一次告诉他他为谁写下了问题

1427
01:01:40,733 --> 01:01:43,000
And I actually told him for the first time who he was writing the question for.

1428
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,866
我简直不敢相信他的表情

1429
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,866
And I couldn't believe his face.

1430
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,400
哦 我的天 那是我最想共进晚餐的人

1431
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,400
Oh my God, that's the one person I want to have dinner with.

1432
01:01:47,466 --> 01:01:50,033
这可能是我们国家最成功的年轻人

1433
01:01:47,466 --> 01:01:50,033
This is probably the most successful young person in our country.

1434
01:01:51,033 --> 01:01:53,433
他是 所以他知道他在为谁写这个问题

1435
01:01:51,033 --> 01:01:53,433
And so he knew who he was writing the question for.

1436
01:01:53,633 --> 01:02:01,466
所以前一位嘉宾为你写下的问题是 你为什么做你所做的？

1437
01:01:53,633 --> 01:02:01,466
So the question that the previous guest wrote for you is, why do you do what you do?

1438
01:02:02,866 --> 01:02:03,833
看看会发生什么

1439
01:02:02,866 --> 01:02:03,833
To see what will happen.

1440
01:02:08,033 --> 01:02:10,700
有些程序你无法预测 对吧？

1441
01:02:08,033 --> 01:02:10,700
Some programs you cannot predict, right?

1442
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,466
你无法预测它们将如何结束

1443
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,466
You cannot predict how they're going to end.

1444
01:02:12,966 --> 01:02:13,933
你必须践行它们

1445
01:02:12,966 --> 01:02:13,933
You have to run them.

1446
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,833
我相信真理会拯救世界

1447
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,833
Well, you know, I believe that truth will save the world.

1448
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:19,266
我相信这一点

1449
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:19,266
I believe that.

1450
01:02:20,366 --> 01:02:21,900
So you speak truthfully.

1451
01:02:20,366 --> 01:02:26,733
所以你诚实地说话 然后看看会发生什么 你承担你的后果

1452
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:26,700
And you watch what happens, and you take your consequences.

1453
01:02:27,933 --> 01:02:31,966
也许你希望并相信 归根结底

1454
01:02:27,933 --> 01:02:31,966
You know, and maybe you hope and have some faith that in the final analysis,

1455
01:02:32,966 --> 01:02:37,100
事情会朝着对你有利的方向发展 但也许会 也许不会 但这就是信念 不是吗？

1456
01:02:32,966 --> 01:02:37,100
things will work out in your favor, but perhaps they will and perhaps they won't.

1457
01:02:37,366 --> 01:02:41,100
But that's faith, eh?

1458
01:02:37,366 --> 01:02:41,633
那就是信仰 那就是信仰

1459
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:41,633
That's faith.

1460
01:02:41,933 --> 01:02:47,133
信仰并不是相信你认为荒谬的事情 牺牲你的才智

1461
01:02:41,933 --> 01:02:47,133
Faith isn't believing in things you regard as ridiculous, sacrificing your intellect.

1462
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,266
它是一个决定

1463
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,266
It's a decision, you know?

1464
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,433
真理、美丽和爱会拯救世界吗？

1465
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,433
Oh, will truth, beauty, and love save the world?

1466
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:55,633
嗯 你可以找出答案

1467
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:55,633
Well, you can find out.

1468
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:03,633
仅仅说谢谢似乎不足以感谢你对我的影响 以及刚才这段时间你所给予我的东西

1469
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:03,633
Thank you doesn't seem to quite cut it for the impact you've had even on me and also for giving me your time.

1470
01:03:03,733 --> 01:03:05,800
我知道你深知时间的巨大价值

1471
01:03:03,733 --> 01:03:05,800
I know you understand the tremendous value of time.

1472
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:07,466
我在你的工作中深深地看到这一点

1473
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:07,466
I've seen it so much in your work.

1474
01:03:07,633 --> 01:03:14,866
所以我要说谢谢 但我还要做出一个我认为更重要的承诺 那就是保持真实

1475
01:03:07,633 --> 01:03:14,866
So I'm going to say thank you, but I'm also going to make a commitment to do something which I think is more important, which is just to be truthful.

1476
01:03:15,133 --> 01:03:20,100
我认为凭借我所拥有的平台和我未来的岁月 也许这是我能为世界做的最大的好事

1477
01:03:15,133 --> 01:03:20,100
And I think with the platform I have in the years I have ahead of me, maybe that's the greatest good that I can do to the world.

1478
01:03:20,233 --> 01:03:27,366
所以因为你来到这里 这是我想对你做出的承诺和誓言 作为我能以因果报应的方式给予的最高形式的感谢

1479
01:03:20,233 --> 01:03:27,366
So because you've come here, that's a pledge and a commitment I want to make you as my highest form of thanks that I can give in a karmic way.

1480
01:03:27,366 --> 01:03:30,566
希望那将使世成为一个对所有人来说都更美好的地方

1481
01:03:27,366 --> 01:03:30,566
Hopefully that will make the world a better place for everybody.

1482
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:39,433
至少 它会帮助确保你不会让世界变得更糟

1483
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:39,433
Well at least it will help ensure that you won't make the world worse place.

1484
01:03:39,433 --> 01:03:41,533
非常感谢你

1485
01:03:39,433 --> 01:03:41,533
Thank you so much.
