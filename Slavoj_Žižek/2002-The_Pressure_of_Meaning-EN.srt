1
00:00:00,641 --> 00:00:02,474
the guy get to deliver speeches, they don't know what.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,737
So they use this water and they drink more,

3
00:00:06,341 --> 00:00:08,353
they go on drinking, so they tend to do it.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,029
Okay, all right.

5
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:17,059
Well, welcome, I'm Jennifer Williams from the Department of English here at Calvin.

6
00:00:17,342 --> 00:00:18,440
Woo, woo, woo!

7
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:24,415
And on behalf of the Center for Christian Scholarship, the Office of Multicultural Affairs,

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,236
the Office of the Provost,

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,577
the Department of Communication Arts and Sciences,

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,299
Department of English, the Department of Philosophy, the Department of Art History, and the Metanexis

11
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:40,477
Institute's Local Societies Initiative, welcome to Calvary College and the lecture by Slavoj Zizek.

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,489
A couple of brief announcements first, there is an overflow room if you don't want to sit on the floor.

13
00:00:48,220 --> 00:01:02,724
It's over in the Seminary Chapel and there's some kind of closed circuit thing so that You can still hear and experience the whole lecture, but you're welcome to continue to be a fire hazard if you like.

14
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:12,084
It is a full room, so if there are any empty seats in the middle, if you could consolidate so that those empty seats are now on the outside, that would be nice.

15
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,119
Tonight's lecture is being recorded.

16
00:01:16,341 --> 00:01:20,812
If you're interested in finding out how to get a copy of that, please make sure you put your name down on.

17
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,797
We have a pad of paper that says recording signs up.

18
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,019
there's one in both of these main doors.

19
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,313
So please make sure you put your name and information down.

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,338
And then finally, we were just curious to know who you all are.

21
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:41,680
So rather than have us all go around the room and introduce ourselves, there are sort of sign-up books at both sides.

22
00:01:42,063 --> 00:01:44,946
And again, we would just love to have your signature just as a record of you being here.

23
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:52,772
My first encounter with Zizek's work occurred back in grad school, where I suppose all these things begin.

24
00:01:53,501 --> 00:02:00,113
I was trying to use Kierkegaard as a theoretical model for an argument about modernism that I was trying to make in my dissertation.

25
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:05,217
And one of my advisors was just absolutely adamant that such a thing could not be done.

26
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:11,914
And she said that to have a dissertation with Kierkegaard, Gertrude Stein, and Conrad would just be weird.

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,713
And as you can tell, I'm scarred for life.

28
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:24,755
So I spent many days poring over books and articles and all kinds of things to see if I could find that perfect quote that would allow me to link all these things together.

29
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:28,956
And one night, a friend of mine from grad school, Jim, emailed me.

30
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:31,737
He had found a page from the ticklish subject

31
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:34,775
and had typed it out in its entirety in the email.

32
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:37,593
To my delight, there enough, on page 211,

33
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:42,654
Zizek makes the connection between Kierkegaard and Monardini that I was miss-seeking.

34
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:45,054
So I wrote back to Jim, this is great.

35
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:47,739
This is great, but what does it mean?

36
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,909
What does Zizek mean?

37
00:02:50,261 --> 00:02:53,089
To which Jim replied, and he'll excuse me, Who the hell knows?

38
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,175
But if Zizek is writing about Kierkegaard, then you know it's important and you can do it too.

39
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:11,540
And this is the same friend, I should say, who was given a t-shirt by his then girlfriend, now wife.

40
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,469
And the t-shirt had the initials WWZS.

41
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,225
What would Zizek say?

42
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:21,606
And Jim told me later he almost proposed to her right on the spot right there.

43
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:29,693
Much have been said, of course, about Zizek's use of pop cultural references alongside these sort of major philosophical works.

44
00:03:30,885 --> 00:03:33,378
But I find that that's something that really is delightful about his work.

45
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:43,974
And one of my favorite features of The Fragile Absolute is that I can think of no other work in which Keanu Reeves and Hegel share the same page in an index.

46
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,671
But most importantly for me in my work is Zizek's engagement with Christianity in the Christian tradition.

47
00:03:50,481 --> 00:04:03,174
Zizek's claim about the radical ethical and political capabilities of what some have declared to be the most foundational and universalist of all foundational and universalist traditions, Christianity, are very invigorating.

48
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,437
In grad school, it was my experience that nobody talked about Christianity unless, of course, you wanted to critique it.

49
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:20,883
And even when philosophers like Jacques Derrida or Alain Badiou would talk about Christianity, it was because they were making religious turns in their old age, as opposed to seriously interrogating the work.

50
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:23,038
But not Zizek.

51
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:26,072
And all of this from an avowed atheist to boot.

52
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:37,694
Just to conclude, Stanley Fish recently reviewed Wendy Brown's book Regulating Aversion, Tolerance in the Age of Identity and Empire for the Chronicle of Higher Education.

53
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:47,498
And in that review, Fish concludes by stating, Brown's account of how liberal tolerance, and therefore liberalism works is nuanced embracing.

54
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,796
The fact that her analysis does not, and in my view, could not deliver a program for improving the world,

55
00:04:54,561 --> 00:05:00,618
or even a set of reasons for rejecting liberal tolerance makes it no different from any other effort, always doomed,

56
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:06,471
to derive a politics from the discourses of postmodernism, anti-essentialism, anti-foundationalism.

57
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:16,174
The title of tonight's lecture, Why Only an Atheist Can Believe, Politics Between Fear and Trembling, leads me to think Zizek may have something to say about such claims.

58
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:20,302
So without further delay, please join me in welcoming Slavo Zizek.

59
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,991
Thank you very much.

60
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:34,698
I'm really glad to be here.

61
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,500
Thank you very much for this nice, maybe too nice introduction.

62
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,593
What I mean is the following.

63
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:49,071
When I hear such gentle and nice words, I always start to look behind my back like, who is that real me you were addressing?

64
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,559
It's too much for me to recognize myself in it.

65
00:05:52,700 --> 00:06:06,117
And now comes the evil point that the name of this gap between what I experience as my immediate self-identity and the symbolic identity that

66
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:17,919
constitutes my public image, that X that you are describing, the name of this gap in psychonetic theory is symbolic castration.

67
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,659
So thanks very much for a castrating experience.

68
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,053
Good beginning, okay.

69
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,956
But let's go on in a little bit more serious way.

70
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,977
I hope you will not be bored, the beginning is a little bit more difficult than maybe things happen.

71
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:33,467
Okay.

72
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:41,540
I would like to begin with something probably known to most of you, maybe all of you,

73
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:48,216
two Hollywood productions released to mark the fifth anniversary of the September 11th.

74
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:56,056
Paul Greengrass's United 93 and Oliver Stone's World Trade Center.

75
00:06:56,056 --> 00:07:02,634
The first thing that strikes the eye is that both films try to be as anti-Hollywood as possible.

76
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:11,460
They both focus on the courage of ordinary people with no glamorous stars, no special effects, no grandiloquent heroic

77
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:19,297
gestures, just a terse realistic depiction of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.

78
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:27,838
It is, however, this very touch of authenticity which raises, I think, some disturbing questions.

79
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:34,938
The first thing one cannot but note is how both films tell the story of an exception.

80
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:45,115
United 93 is about the only one of the four kidnapped planes in which the terrorists failed, which did not hit its destination.

81
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:57,518
World Trade Center tells the story of the two of those 20 or so policemen, firemen, who were saved from the ruins of World Trade Center.

82
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,630
The disaster is thus turned into a kind of triumph, most notably in United 93.

83
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,873
Here, a comparison with Spielberg's Schindler's List is instructive.

84
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:21,879
Although I think Schindler's List is a failure, the idea to choose Schindler as a hero was a correct one.

85
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:32,737
It is precisely by focusing on a German who did something to help the Jews, that one demonstrates how it was possible to do something,

86
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:41,336
and thus to condemn those who did nothing, claiming that the regime was so totalitarian, it was not possible to do anything, and so on.

87
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:52,796
In United 93, on the contrary, the focus on the rebellion serves the purpose of preventing us to ask the truly pertinent questions.

88
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,938
That is to say, let us indulge in a simple mental experiment.

89
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:04,437
Let us imagine both films, United 93, World Trade Center with the same change.

90
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,549
Let us say that instead of United 93,

91
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:15,938
we would get a film called American 11, the name of another flight which did hit its target.

92
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:30,516
Or let us imagine World Trade Center remade as the story of two of the firefighters or policemen who did die in the rubble of the Twin Towers after postponed prolonged suffering,

93
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,296
without in any way justifying the terrible crime or showing an understanding for it.

94
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,888
Such aversion would confront us with the true horror of the situation.

95
00:09:44,121 --> 00:09:53,355
It would thus compel us to think, to start asking serious questions about how such a thing could have happened and what does it mean.

96
00:09:54,340 --> 00:10:07,679
The second feature, both films restrain not only from taking a political stance about the events, but even from depicting their larger political contacts.

97
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:17,478
That is to say, neither the passengers on United 93 flight nor the policemen in World Trade Center have a grasp on the full picture.

98
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:24,855
All of a sudden, they find themselves thrown into a terrifying situation, and they have to make the best out of it.

99
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:31,295
This lack of what Frederic Jameson would have called cognitive mapping is crucial.

100
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:42,437
Both films depict ordinary people affected by the sudden brutal intrusion of history with a capital H, the invisible real that hurts.

101
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,555
All we see are the disastrous effects.

102
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,456
So that in the case of World Trade Center,

103
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:56,258
One can easily imagine exactly the same film in which the Twin Towers would have collapsed,

104
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,576
not because of the terrorist attack, but due, let us say, to a strong earthquake.

105
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,855
Or even more problematically, we can imagine the same film,

106
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,297
the same narrative at least, taking place, for example, to be really evil in a big German city

107
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:17,178
in the winter of 1944 after a devastating Allied bombing.

108
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:30,638
Or even more evil surmise, what about the same film taking place in a bombed high-rise building in southern Beirut during the last Lebanon-Israel conflict?

109
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:32,195
And that's the point.

110
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,875
It cannot take place there.

111
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:43,253
Such a film taking place in southern Beirut would have been immediately dismissed as a subtle pro-Hezbollah terrorist propaganda or something similar.

112
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:53,794
What this means is that the two films message ideological, political message, resides in their very abstention from delivering a message.

113
00:11:54,620 --> 00:12:01,258
This abstention is sustained by an implicit trust into one's government.

114
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,679
When the enemy attacks, one just don't think, do your duty.

115
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,580
This is what I call Britney Spears' theory of action.

116
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:19,219
Because effectively, I remember two years ago, seeing Britney Spears' interview on MTV, She was asked, what does she think about Iraq and so on?

117
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,539
And she said, I don't quite understand it.

118
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,096
All I know is that at a certain point, we ordinary people should simply trust our president.

119
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:39,255
This brings us back to our starting point, to the concrete character of the two films depicting ordinary people in a terse realistic mode.

120
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:49,177
Now, we philosophers know Kegel's counter-intuitive use of the opposition of abstract and concrete.

121
00:12:49,700 --> 00:13:00,938
As you all know in our ordinary language, abstract are general notions, as opposed to concrete, really existing singular objects and events.

122
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:03,038
Talking does not exist.

123
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:07,334
I, maybe, I'm not so sure, exist here now talking to you.

124
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:14,316
For Hegel, on the contrary, it is such immediate reality which is abstract.

125
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:22,618
And to render it concrete means to deploy the complex universal context that gives meaning to it.

126
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,952
Let me give you an example which is fictional because I don't smoke.

127
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:39,076
If I were to smoke here for Hegel, the most abstract approach would have been simply to present me here as this really existing individual smoking.

128
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:54,276
A concrete approach would have been to render visible, to articulate the complex historical, social, economic, ideological context which has to be here so that I can smoke here.

129
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:01,277
European colonization of Latin America where, if I am correctly informed, smoking comes

130
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:14,818
from then the development of industry, plantations, or in a more delicate way, why do we have have to smoke, stress of work, relaxation and so on.

131
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:30,218
All this context has to be here so that this pseudo-concrete reality can happen and that wider context, this is what we call dialectical mediation, is what for Hegel is concrete.

132
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,676
And back to the two films, here is the problem.

133
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,195
Both are abstract in the Hegelian sense.

134
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:51,078
The function of their down-to-earth depiction of concrete individuals struggling for life is not just to avoid cheap commercial spectacle, but to obliterate the historical context.

135
00:14:51,700 --> 00:15:04,237
Here then is where we are five years later, still unable to locate September 11 into a large narrative, to provide some kind of generally acceptable cognitive mapping.

136
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,683
The third feature.

137
00:15:06,683 --> 00:15:14,424
In both films, there is a key moment which violates the terse realistic style.

138
00:15:14,424 --> 00:15:19,339
United 93 starts with kidnappers in a motel room, praying, getting ready.

139
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:23,732
They look austere, like some kind of angels of death.

140
00:15:23,732 --> 00:15:29,007
And the first shot, after the title credits, confirms this impression.

141
00:15:29,007 --> 00:15:40,139
It is a panoramic shot from high above, Manhattan in the night, camera moving above the streets, accompanied by the sound of the kidnappers' prayers,

142
00:15:40,163 --> 00:15:48,478
as if the kidnappers stroll above the city, getting ready to descend on earth to ripe their deadly harvest.

143
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:55,289
Similarly, there are no direct shots of the planes hitting the Twin Towers in World Trade Center.

144
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:07,279
All that we see seconds before the catastrophe is when one of the policemen is on a busy Street, an ominous shadow quickly passing over the crowd there.

145
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:13,731
Of course, we know, retrospectively, the shadow of the first plane seconds before it will hit its target.

146
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:25,537
These shots confirm on both films a strange theological reverberation, as if the attacks were a kind of divine intervention.

147
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,529
What do I mean by this?

148
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,917
Recall the first reaction of Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson to the September 11th bombings.

149
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:49,068
You remember the scandal, of course, because they perceived the bombings as a sign that God lifted up its protection of the United States because of the sinful way of life of contemporary Americans.

150
00:16:50,760 --> 00:17:02,778
They put the blame on hedonist materialism, liberalism, rampant sexuality, basically claiming exactly the same thing as Muslim fundamentalists, that America got what it deserved.

151
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:15,639
Now in a hidden way, I think, United 93 and World Trade Center tend to do the opposite, but within the same frame, to read the September 11th catastrophe as a blessing in disguise,

152
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:24,531
as a divine intervention from above, destined to awaken us from moral slumber and to bring out the best in us.

153
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:32,950
World Trade Center ends with the off-screen works of an anonymous narrator which spells out this message.

154
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:39,217
Terrible events like the Twin Towers destruction bring out in people the worst and the best.

155
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,798
People are shown to be able to do things they would never imagine of being able.

156
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:57,357
So it is as if our societies need a major catastrophe in order to resuscitate the spirit of communal solidarity.

157
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,080
Now, here things get really interesting.

158
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,032
They bring us to our topic.

159
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:16,798
I don't think this is anything bad, because I think that if you look in a much more refined, delicate way, these big science fiction catastrophe movies.

160
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:26,917
I think that they are one of the last places where we can still discern some kind of utopian socialist element in Hollywood.

161
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:33,120
I always think that this big catastrophe, spectacular destruction that we see is basically a lure.

162
00:18:33,261 --> 00:18:34,852
It's here to deceive us.

163
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:47,171
The truly fascinating thing is what happens as a byproduct, the sudden supsurge of solidarity, dedication, communal love, and so on, and so on.

164
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,559
And the message is basically, again, a sad one.

165
00:18:50,740 --> 00:19:01,179
It is that the only way in our society is to imagine this kind of solidarity activity is against the background of a catastrophe.

166
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,951
But now let me move to what really disturbs me in these two films.

167
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:23,935
Implicitly, I claim, they not justify, but how should I put it, contextualize or provide the interpretation of the events as part of some deeper meaning,

168
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,935
how should I put it, in the sense of these events really happened in order to awaken us.

169
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,074
a secret teleology built in them.

170
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,473
They are terrible, but a blessing in disguise.

171
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:52,119
Of course, this brings us to certain teleological and theological reading of history, which I think precisely

172
00:19:52,440 --> 00:20:00,616
if we want to remain faithful to Judeo-Christian legacy, we should unconditionally reject.

173
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:14,360
This, I claim, false teleology best exemplified by that well-known metaphor of a painting.

174
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:26,460
You know, when something appears discordant, terrifying, horrible to us, it is as if we are looking at the painting, the painting being the universe, from we are too close to it.

175
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,854
And it appears as a stain.

176
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:36,635
Like if you look even at the most beautiful painting, whatever you want, Rembrandt, da Vinci, too close you see a stain.

177
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:44,396
You withdraw it, you see how what appeared as a stain contributes to global harmony.

178
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:55,720
But I think that precisely with catastrophes, maybe even much larger, of course, than September 11, like Holocaust, the Stalinist Gulag, and why not?

179
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,615
We live in the middle of such a catastrophe.

180
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,476
It makes you think why we don't talk more about it.

181
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,937
You remember this summer, there was a cover story on the Time magazine.

182
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:16,118
So it's publicly known that in the last 10 years, at least 4 million people died of unnatural causes in Congo.

183
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:17,837
OK, we ignore it.

184
00:21:18,061 --> 00:21:24,198
So this should at least make use of speeches of whenever a humanitarian crisis is discovered,

185
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:33,280
The sad lesson is that there is always some political, strategic calculation behind it.

186
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:38,797
But what I want to say, when we witness such a tragedy, let's say Auschwitz, Holocaust,

187
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:48,557
you can feel that it's in a way obscene to say, ah, Auschwitz appears such a tragedy because we are too close to it, we see it as a stain.

188
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:59,358
but from a proper distance available only to God, it would be clear how this contributes to global harmony of the universe or whatever.

189
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,674
It's an obscenity.

190
00:22:02,674 --> 00:22:03,398
What does this mean?

191
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:10,760
This means, for example, that we should finally take the lesson of what for me as

192
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:24,456
an atheist is absolutely unsurpassable ethical revolution, one of the maybe two, three path-breaking texts, entire human history, the Book of Job in the Bible.

193
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,411
Remember what happens there.

194
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,639
Forget the very beginning.

195
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:45,257
I think this is just probably taken over from some previous tradition, which is why enemies of Judeo-Christian tradition like to point, you know that obscene conversation, like, you know, God and devil sitting at the table, desserts are served drinks, and then they, oh, what about that guy, blah, blah.

196
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,333
That's an obscenity, forget that.

197
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,137
Think about, focus on what happens.

198
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,236
Job is hit by calamities.

199
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,697
And what does Job do?

200
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,360
It's incredible how spontaneously we try to falsify his image.

201
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:11,219
Once I asked my friends, atheist or religious, and most of them had this totally fake memory that Job is a guy who,

202
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:20,239
and there should reside the lesson of the story, who silently suffers, humbly submits to divine will.

203
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:21,392
Not at all.

204
00:23:21,962 --> 00:23:22,700
He's angry.

205
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:24,097
He protests all the time.

206
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,837
But here, also, we should be very precise.

207
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:29,494
What happens there?

208
00:23:30,061 --> 00:23:35,473
He doesn't protest in this vulgar economic sense, I didn't deserve it, blah, blah.

209
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,416
There are three bad guys, three theologists there, who are precisely providers of meaning.

210
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:49,998
The point of their, you know, three friends, or four, I'm not going to look at this, three, they don't,

211
00:23:50,521 --> 00:23:57,735
the point is not that they put the blame on Job, that's secondary, like the first one who provides the simple pseudo-hermeneutics.

212
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:04,197
God is just, so if you suffer, even if you are not aware now of what, you must have done something.

213
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:05,995
No, it's more precise.

214
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,478
They just desperately try to provide a meaning.

215
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:17,218
Their underlying hypothesis, or axiom, is it must have some meaning, if we know it or not.

216
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:25,158
And the absolute greatness, that's undescribable ethical revolution, I think, of Job is to reject this meaning.

217
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,678
I see in this the sense of his bitter insistence.

218
00:24:30,181 --> 00:24:35,779
Not I'm good, I'm extra good, I served God, but I didn't deserve it.

219
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,919
Again, not in the sense I was good, but in the sense of no, But there is no deeper meaning here.

220
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,378
And remember what happens then when God finally intervenes.

221
00:24:45,961 --> 00:24:48,257
He gives full right to Job.

222
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:59,674
He says to the three, quick ideologies, quickly, to the three, like maybe the name of one of them was, I don't know, one was Pat, the other was Jerry, who knows who was the third one.

223
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,219
And he says, no, against them.

224
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:08,397
So I think, again, that today this pressure of meaning is strong.

225
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,179
And now, my god, I will speak like a kind of a biblical preacher.

226
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,958
But I mean it sincerely, in the sense of beware of succumbing to this pressure.

227
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:19,060
I mean it seriously.

228
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:22,360
This is where the devil waits upon you.

229
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:33,198
This is paganism, pagan universe, as all intelligent, not only Protestants, but Catholic also, like Chesterton pointed out.

230
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:39,057
You know, this universal hermeneutic attitude, this metaphoric reading of the universe.

231
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:49,338
This rose, that rose, cat is not a cat, it's devil, the dog is, you know, like this fullness of meaning, no, this is not Judeo-Christian legacy.

232
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,658
Judeo-Christian legacy is much more bitter.

233
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,479
You accept the meaninglessness of the universe.

234
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:08,957
And today, again, it's a danger to succumb to this pseudo-hermeneutics when we witness things like AIDS, the prospect of ideological catastrophe, and so on.

235
00:26:09,121 --> 00:26:12,059
It's so simple to succumb to this temptation.

236
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:21,796
AIDS, oh, it must have some meaning, punishment for this ecology, yes, because we disturbed the balance of yin yang and so on or whatever.

237
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,994
And no, you start with a little bit of hermeneutic of ecology, I warn you.

238
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,220
You end up in Da Vinci Code, no?

239
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,160
And then you end up with Jesus Christ copulating, you know?

240
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,393
It's a small step from one to the other, no?

241
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:43,837
So again, one has to resist this temptation, which is a terrible temptation.

242
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,378
Let me give you a brutal, extreme example,

243
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,977
which I not like, but it's at least convincing.

244
00:26:52,600 --> 00:27:00,755
When I was in Israel, I was told that there is a minor sect, but nonetheless not negligible, quite strong, sect of people.

245
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:13,258
And there is a rabbi who leads them who believe that, among other things, that Holocaust was justified, that the Jewish people, European Jews, did something very sinful.

246
00:27:13,601 --> 00:27:19,937
OK, he tries to specify it as integrating themselves too much into European societies, and that this was divine punishment.

247
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:28,097
It's terrible, but I understand it in the sense that even if the message is a bad one, we deserved it.

248
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,579
Often, it's better a bad message than no message.

249
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:40,460
Because even if the message is bad, what you nonetheless gain is a dialogue with the meaningful universe.

250
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,991
It still means things have a global meaning, and so on, and so on.

251
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,638
So that's my first theoretical point.

252
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:48,830
Let's go now on.

253
00:27:49,620 --> 00:28:05,813
Undoubtedly, at least some of you, if we were to be immediately in a dialogue, would have reacted to what I've said, saying, but this is not what I directly or how I directly experienced the film.

254
00:28:06,642 --> 00:28:07,437
It's not open.

255
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:07,786
Yes.

256
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,696
And now I come to my second crucial point.

257
00:28:11,722 --> 00:28:24,817
The level at which this logic operates, this obscene, I claim, beliefs, it must have had a meaning, is not the level of our explicit beliefs.

258
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,495
It's the level of what?

259
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:33,899
I will describe this level now, briefly referring to what I developed in some of my books.

260
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:44,198
Namely, I would like, in case of professional solidarity, referring to a philosopher who, three days ago, lost his job,

261
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:54,776
referred to a well-known contemporary American philosopher who elaborated the relationship between what we know and what we don't know.

262
00:28:55,341 --> 00:28:55,977
You got the point.

263
00:28:56,141 --> 00:28:57,556
Sorry, old joke, Donald Trump.

264
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,714
No, I mean, I'm referring to, you remember in March 2003,

265
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:11,875
Donald Rumsfeld gave the famous interview where he developed his thoughts on the relationship between known and unknown.

266
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,453
Here it is, the quote.

267
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,674
There are known knowns.

268
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,337
There are things we know that we know.

269
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,391
That's clear.

270
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,514
Like, I don't know.

271
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:26,499
I'm here at Calvin College, and I know that I'm here.

272
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:27,798
I know that I know that.

273
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,879
Then he goes on, there are known unknowns.

274
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,558
That is to say, there are things that we know we don't know.

275
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,079
This is also clear.

276
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:42,778
Like, I know there are some cars outside this building, but I don't know how many cars are parked there.

277
00:29:43,101 --> 00:29:45,059
And I know that I don't know this.

278
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,654
That is to say, this is something that I don't know, but it's still, how should I put it,

279
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:57,079
with regard to the horizon of understanding or of meaning, It's still within the field of my knowledge.

280
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,638
I clearly don't know that I know that.

281
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:01,919
Then Rumsfeld goes on.

282
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:07,397
This was, of course, destined at that point to warn us of unpredictable horrors hidden in Iraq.

283
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,236
But there are also unknown unknowns.

284
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,097
There are things we don't know that we don't know.

285
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:15,436
It's also clear.

286
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:25,777
Let us say if Saddam were to have some ultra-secret weapon or whatever, not the ordinary weapons of mass destruction that we suspected that he had.

287
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,199
This would be unknown unknowns.

288
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,236
It's not simply that we didn't know.

289
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,138
We even wouldn't have known that we don't know.

290
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,377
Because it's totally outside our horizon.

291
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:48,300
But here, unfortunately, the dialectical strength of Rumsfeld thinking finds its limit.

292
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:52,338
Because did you notice that the fourth term is missing?

293
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,235
We have known knowns.

294
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:00,214
We have known unknowns we know that we don't know, and we have unknown unknowns.

295
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,654
It's so much outside our horizon
that we don't know that we don't know.

296
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,954
What about the fourth term, which I claim is the most interesting one?

297
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:17,877
Not the known unknowns, but the unknown knowns, things we know, but we don't even know that we know them.

298
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,414
That is to say, this is ideology.

299
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,160
Ideology is not so much our explicit thesis.

300
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:33,135
Today, of course, belief, as everybody says in hedonist, cynical era, nobody's ready to fight for big causes.

301
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:41,259
What I claim is that, nonetheless, there are, more than ever maybe, beliefs here, beliefs which,

302
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:50,179
although we would never publicly admit that they are our beliefs, we, as it were, practice these beliefs.

303
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:56,060
They are embodied in our knowledge, in the materials we use, and so on, and so on.

304
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:02,955
And to end up to just make the last mention of poor Rumsfeld, I think that that's why he lost his job.

305
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,998
Because he didn't know what he knows.

306
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:12,218
OK, to put it in more consistent way, knowing quite serious, why did things in Iraq go wrong?

307
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:25,578
Precisely because American politics was not aware of its unknown knowns, of the implicit ideological prejudices, presuppositions, which they were simply here,

308
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,919
not even you are aware of them, but they regulate your activity.

309
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:40,713
You know, like presuppositions about how everybody in the world likes American type of democracy, presuppositions about how the people will react in Iraq, and so on, and so on, and so on.

310
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:47,055
So this level is, I think, crucial for the functioning of ideology.

311
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,755
All these things that, and this is the crucial problem of belief, I claim.

312
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,953
All these things that we, in a way, believe without believing.

313
00:32:59,081 --> 00:33:01,780
In my book, The Parallax View, I developed more in detail.

314
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,773
I will just mention it here.

315
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:11,116
The wonderful example, which I found in a biography of Niels Bohr, of Copenhagen quantum physics.

316
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:19,176
Niels Bohr, incidentally, was also the guy who, I think, provided a wonderful right answer to Einstein.

317
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,878
You know that Einstein's well-known phrase, which reflects his distrust in quantum physics,

318
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,955
God doesn't play dice.

319
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:30,252
Everybody knows this.

320
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,855
But you know what was Niels Bohr's answer?

321
00:33:33,601 --> 00:33:35,178
Don't tell God what to do.

322
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,739
I mean, it's correct.

323
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,995
OK, this is even a more beautiful story.

324
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,756
A friend visited Nils Bohr in a countryside house.

325
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:50,095
And notice above the entrance door, a horseshoe.

326
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:57,240
In Europe, I don't know how it is here, a horseshoe is kind of a superstitious item.

327
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:04,176
If you put it above the entrance, it is supposed to keep out the evil spirits and keep the house safe, whatever.

328
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,498
Now the friend was shocked and addressed Nils Bohr.

329
00:34:07,841 --> 00:34:09,560
My god, I thought you are a scientist.

330
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,956
Do you believe in this kind of superstitious crap?

331
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,759
Nils Bohr answered, no, of course not.

332
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,555
I'm not crazy.

333
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,394
Then the other guy says, but why is it there then?

334
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,818
Here Nils Bohr gave the correct answer.

335
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:28,155
Not the usual boring, fake, multiculturalist tolerant one that we like today.

336
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:29,798
It's just our way of life.

337
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,096
It is out of respect for and so on.

338
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:33,476
I know this story.

339
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,932
All my Jewish friends, they don't believe in kosher food,

340
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,898
But they don't eat pork out of respect for, and so on, no.

341
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,256
And you get here wonderful paradoxes.

342
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,639
I mean, I'm not focusing on Jews with Arabs.

343
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,995
It's the same with us Christians.

344
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,213
I'm saying because I know the situation there.

345
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,218
A typical Jew, of course, doesn't believe in God.

346
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,198
But nonetheless, he believes that God gave them the land of Israel, that they can have it.

347
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,553
That's another story, no?

348
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,518
But what I want to say is, so what is then the answer, not this politically correct, of Nils Bohr?

349
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:07,575
Why do you have it?

350
00:35:07,921 --> 00:35:08,695
It's a wonderful one.

351
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:11,919
He answered, of course, I don't believe in it.

352
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:16,493
But I have it there because I was told that it works even if you don't believe in it.

353
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,436
That's ideology today.

354
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,599
You don't have to believe in democracy.

355
00:35:21,721 --> 00:35:22,714
You practice it.

356
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,877
And your beliefs are out there in practice.

357
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,318
Let me give you, let's go to the end here.

358
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:36,179
It will be, as it's usual with me, I'm sorry if I offend some of you, an absolutely scatological, obscene end point.

359
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,416
but I cannot resist repeating an old story that I often use.

360
00:35:41,481 --> 00:35:49,176
If you had the fortune of misfortune to travel around Europe, maybe you noticed how, in what different way,

361
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,896
now comes the dangerous point, toilets are structured in Europe.

362
00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:00,819
You have the French toilets where the hole where excrement disappears is in the back.

363
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:06,036
So the idea is it drops, falls directly into it, it goes away as soon as possible.

364
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:10,794
Then you have English or yours, Anglo-Saxon, where it floats in water.

365
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:19,596
Then you have the German one, which is the most obscene, of course, which is that the hole is in front.

366
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:26,019
And you have just a little bit of water in the hole so that most of the bowl is a kind of a plateau.

367
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,460
The idea is your excrement falls there to enable.

368
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:39,499
It's an old, disgusting German tradition that every morning you should inspect your bowl, sniff it, and so on to see, look for any traces of illness.

369
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,779
If you don't believe me, go and look.

370
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,633
It's quite a cultural shock.

371
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:47,217
Now I ask myself, why this?

372
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,324
What's the point?

373
00:36:50,721 --> 00:36:51,457
I read books.

374
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,071
There are two books on the market,

375
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,797
so you can check it on architect, very obscene books.

376
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,335
They have scientific studies.

377
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,099
In what angle shit falls down.

378
00:37:06,512 --> 00:37:08,440
And they don't give an account of this.

379
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,539
They simply eat every book that I know or text plays this simple utilitarian card.

380
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,550
Oh, how is that the other guys don't see that ours is the most utilitarian, the most practical?

381
00:37:19,141 --> 00:37:20,316
But then it strike me.

382
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,980
Of course, things are more complex in reality.

383
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,734
But basically, I claim this is the only account that I can imagine.

384
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:43,938
Do you know that, if you know a little bit of the history of European thought, around the time of Hegel, it was popular to claim that, to assert the notion of so-called European Trinity.

385
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:51,157
The idea being that Europe, as a spiritual entity, is structured around three poles.

386
00:37:51,560 --> 00:38:04,523
Each of them stands for a certain nation, for a certain political attitude or attitude towards life, and for a certain level of social life.

387
00:38:04,523 --> 00:38:11,598
Germans are politically conservative, the level of life is poetry, thinking, contemplation.

388
00:38:13,383 --> 00:38:18,919
French, politics, level of life, domain of life, politically leftist, revolutionary.

389
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:26,375
English. Economy as a sphere of life and moderate liberalism.

390
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:28,098
It did strike me, but that's it.

391
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,012
The French approach this radical politics.

392
00:38:32,012 --> 00:38:34,000
It falls in, liquidated, disappears.

393
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,644
It's like guillotine.

394
00:38:35,644 --> 00:38:37,208
It should disappear.

395
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:40,275
Anglo-Saxon, pragmatic.

396
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:41,738
Let it flow there.

397
00:38:41,738 --> 00:38:43,723
We will solve the problem.

398
00:38:43,723 --> 00:38:49,875
Germans, of course, poetry and contemplation.

399
00:38:49,875 --> 00:39:00,209
Now, crazy as this may sound, but believe me or not, in a way it is true that I say, that's my point, serious point that I want to make.

400
00:39:00,209 --> 00:39:02,737
It's easy to say, oh, no ideology and so on.

401
00:39:02,737 --> 00:39:07,491
My God, you go to the toilet and you sit on ideology, how should I put it.

402
00:39:07,491 --> 00:39:17,860
That is to say, even such the lowest of the lowest vulgar everyday object cannot be accounted for in direct utilitarian terms.

403
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:29,798
It is structured like this because it's the most appropriate but embodies certain very fundamental attitudes towards what is one of the big problems of life,

404
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:35,838
what to do with this embarrassing excrement that comes out of our body.

405
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,237
And this is not a secondary point.

406
00:39:38,661 --> 00:39:54,414
Every good anthropologist will tell you that one of the signs that you are dealing with humans no longer with apes or animals is that you have this embarrassment what to do with feet, basically.

407
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,417
It must disappear.

408
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:04,059
It's the whole problem of, I mean, we are immediately in the deepest metaphysics.

409
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:08,879
I'm quite serious, which is, what we as humans,

410
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,458
I think that disgust is a deeply human emotion.

411
00:40:14,841 --> 00:40:15,955
And what is disgust?

412
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:22,518
Disgust is not necessarily immediately characterized by its object.

413
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:28,178
It has to do something with the disturbed frontier between inside and outside.

414
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,735
Disgust is with something inside, from your inside, you confront it from the outside.

415
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,740
OK, now you can tell me, but shit is disgusting.

416
00:40:38,821 --> 00:40:41,769
No, but let's take a more neutral example, which I hope will convince you.

417
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,538
You have saliva all the time in your mouth.

418
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:50,098
You swallow it now all the time, no problem, nothing disgusting.

419
00:40:50,661 --> 00:40:51,779
Do, or rather, don't do it.

420
00:40:51,902 --> 00:40:52,539
I can't do it.

421
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:56,378
But try to do a certain extremely elementary example.

422
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:03,638
Take a glass, spit in it, kind of a certain strata, a half an inch of your saliva, look, and then try to drink it.

423
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,977
You cannot, because it's outside.

424
00:41:06,321 --> 00:41:07,032
It's disgusting.

425
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:08,170
It's disgusting.

426
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:15,418
So what I want to say is that you cannot imagine how much this tells us about human identity.

427
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:22,397
The point being that at a certain level, precisely at the level of Rumsfeldian unknown knowns,

428
00:41:23,301 --> 00:41:34,399
we do not perceive ourselves in this most elementary phenomenological self-experience, we do not perceive ourselves as beings with depth.

429
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,739
The depth is spiritual, not bodily.

430
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,097
I claim that when I look at you,

431
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:48,736
I somehow obstruct the fact that beneath your skin there are pretty horrible things, all the blood, bones, whatever.

432
00:41:49,240 --> 00:42:02,999
When I look you into your eyes, head, I behave as if there is some kind of a soul spiritual presence inside, not the stupidity of biological machine or whatever.

433
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:08,595
So this tells us a lot about this most immediate phenomenology of our experience.

434
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:14,857
Again, the way it is embodied in this unknown knowns.

435
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,359
Now, let me make a step further.

436
00:42:19,882 --> 00:42:37,159
And the central mystery here is that these beliefs, even if we are aware of them, another way that we deal with them is that we transpose them onto others.

437
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:43,459
There is nothing hypocritical in it, or rather it's a kind of sincere hypocrisy.

438
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,544
What do we mean by this?

439
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:51,536
My favorite example here is another one which I repeatedly use in my books.

440
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,199
Do you know the Tibetan praying meals?

441
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:01,756
Like, you write a prayer, you put it into a meal, you turn it around, or even better,

442
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,739
you put it on a windmill, and it turns around itself.

443
00:43:05,941 --> 00:43:08,740
And to put it in a slightly cynical way, it's wonderful.

444
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,016
Like, you can think about sex, whatever you want, but objectively, you pray, no?

445
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:14,514
It prays for you.

446
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,779
Now, you will say, ha ha, this goes for primitive cultures.

447
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:32,478
No, we have exactly same phenomena all around. Think about what, if you ask me, is one of the great contributions of American civilization to world culture, can laughter on TV.

448
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,419
You know, laughter being part of the soundtrack.

449
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,236
It's a very mysterious phenomenon.

450
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:39,494
Why does it work?

451
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:40,918
Namely, how does it work?

452
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:47,758
It's not as many people think that it's It's a kind of a Pavlovian reflex machine to signal you when to laugh.

453
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,029
No, as a rule, you don't laugh.

454
00:43:50,029 --> 00:44:02,438
You return home in the evening, tired as a dog, you put it on, cheers, friends, whatever, you hear the laughter and you just look at it as an idiot and when it ends, you feel relieved.

455
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,232
It is as if you have laughed.

456
00:44:06,232 --> 00:44:08,339
I mean, it's a paradox how, first to put

457
00:44:08,901 --> 00:44:20,615
I mean, even the most intimate, spontaneous expression of yourself, like laughter, can be transposed onto others.

458
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,915
The same goes also especially, I claim, for example, for beliefs.

459
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,173
What do I mean by this?

460
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:44,799
Did you notice how often in families where parents have belief or stop believing, what What happens is that they desperately cling to another one.

461
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:50,698
It can be their parents, old mother, children, who should believe.

462
00:44:51,160 --> 00:45:03,713
What really breaks them down is that much more than their disbelief is to discover that this other, whose innocence should be protected, doesn't believe.

463
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,839
for many people who participate in sexual orgies and so on.

464
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:27,620
I spoke recently with a sociologist who investigated this and told me how, as a rule, there can be ruthless group orgies, whatever you want, but they always have somebody who should remain innocent, who shouldn't know about it.

465
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:33,912
The moment that happens, their life literally falls apart.

466
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,996
This structure, I think, is extremely interesting.

467
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,439
Let me give you another example from literature.

468
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:50,438
Okay, literature, I only saw the film, the Edith Wharton's Age of Innocence.

469
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:58,123
This is the beauty of the story that you remember, the affair between Newland and that Count Olenskauer who?

470
00:45:58,123 --> 00:45:58,805
No.

471
00:45:58,805 --> 00:46:03,579
But the wife, to put it in human terms, Winona Ryder, the young wife

472
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,690
is supposed to be naive not to know.

473
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:08,978
And then you know what happens at the end.

474
00:46:08,978 --> 00:46:12,707
The wife, young wife of the hero dies.

475
00:46:12,707 --> 00:46:21,018
He thinks he is free now legally to rejoin his love of of Longyear's mistress, Michelle Pfeiffer in the film,

476
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:32,760
then at this very point, his son tells him that the wife knew it all the time, just pretended not to know, and it's ruined.

477
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:33,554
He cannot do it.

478
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:46,978
You see, he was engaged in this transgressive behavior, whatever, but on condition that another one, of this innocence of another one.

479
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:59,299
So this is the great mystery of how, even if we don't believe, we claim to be cynical and so on, we have this need for another one to remain pure to believe.

480
00:46:59,701 --> 00:47:01,079
I know now enough of jokes.

481
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:04,878
I know a much more serious and tragic version of this.

482
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:17,235
Agnes Heller, probably unknown to almost all of you, is a Hungarian philosopher who was during, now she's a very old lady, during World War II in, I think it was even Auschwitz.

483
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,932
I mean, she has all these numbers, the real one, how should I put it.

484
00:47:22,341 --> 00:47:30,820
And she told me a very interesting story, how in every barrack in the camp, there were two types of people, basically.

485
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:37,099
There were survivalists, those who were totally bitter, but still struggled for survival.

486
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,078
And this was some kind of a codified egotism.

487
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:46,354
You were allowed, if the other guy was stupid and left some food there and walked away, you were allowed to steal it.

488
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:49,915
There were some minimal rules, but very hard rules.

489
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,474
Then there were so-called Muslims, Muslim men, and the living dead.

490
00:47:55,100 --> 00:48:00,517
The ones who simply no longer cared, just as living dead walked around.

491
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:05,039
And then, now comes the tragic point, story she told me.

492
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:14,117
Then there was in every barrack a myth that somewhere out there, usually in a next barrack, next,

493
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,577
There is somebody who is still fully human.

494
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,536
That is to say, somebody who didn't regress to this level of survivalism.

495
00:48:23,282 --> 00:48:24,158
Still, you do that.

496
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,956
You just cruelly try to survive.

497
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:33,737
But who behaves even in those terrifying circumstances as if you are in normal life.

498
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,056
He helped others, shared food, and so on.

499
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:47,677
And she told me something very interesting, that the most dangerous moment for your psychic integrity was when, as unfortunately it was the case,

500
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:55,897
you sooner or later discovered that this is a myth, that this other is like most of us.

501
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:10,177
At that point, usually people lose even the will to survive, even this will to struggle and regress to what was called Muslim, Muslimen, that is to say, turned into living dead.

502
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:12,196
So you see the nice here.

503
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:23,338
Even, to put it in more almost theological terms, even to be consistently evil, you need a presupposed goodness somewhere up there.

504
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:26,960
And I claim, now we shouldn't underestimate this.

505
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:31,035
Now don't go into this orgy, oh, divine spark, we are all deeply good.

506
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:38,078
No, the problem is that the same holds for Hitler, for Stalin, from whoever you want.

507
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:43,099
I have no doubts that they were doing with this innocence in view.

508
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:48,496
That is to say, you can also give to this a very nasty term, unethical term.

509
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:57,938
You have, for example, with Stalinist communists, even more in this case with Nazis, this especially perverse logic,

510
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:08,215
which is that the greatest heroism when tough things have to be done, you kill, you torture, and so on, that through every idiot can be good.

511
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:17,659
The greatest heroism is to do the necessary tough, cruel thing to protect the innocence of the others.

512
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:28,672
If you look at one of the most disgusting ethical documents, but it's still an ethical document in the sense that crazy as it sounds, it tries to articulate the ethics of 20th century,

513
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:46,399
The famous speech in 33 October, 43, I think, of Heinrich Himmler, SS, had two officers for the preparation of Holocaust in Posen, a Polish city.

514
00:50:47,160 --> 00:51:01,253
He there uttered these famous phrases, claiming that Holocaust will be the most glorious chapter of German history, but the chapter which, unfortunately, will never be written.

515
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,378
That is to say, the message is we are the true heroes.

516
00:51:05,881 --> 00:51:06,879
It's a terrible message.

517
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:23,118
The message is you are in front of, I mean, in a way, Himmler, that's the horror of it, was bothered by a true ethical problem, which is how could SS officers and soldiers do their dirty job?

518
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:29,357
slaughtering, killing children, women, without becoming beasts themselves.

519
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:44,520
His solution was this kind of heroism, that you perceive your very evil acts as the supreme act of heroism, ready to descend into this hell for the good of the people.

520
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,876
It's a terrifying logic.

521
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:52,878
So since, unfortunately, time is running, let me go on.

522
00:51:58,007 --> 00:52:14,293
This delicate relationship between what we believe and what we know, or rather, what we explicitly know and this disavowed beliefs, they are at work in a very refined way in our daily experience.

523
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:30,841
Often you believe in something, you can even believe sincerely, but nonetheless it's It's a great shock and surprise if you see your belief confirmed directly in a too brutal way.

524
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:42,519
Did you see the film, isn't there, I was told that tomorrow there will be here a play by Steve Martin, somewhere, okay, doesn't matter, performed.

525
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:56,219
The point is that he acts in a film, Leap of Faith from 1992, maybe you saw it, which This is one thing about a con artist, this preacher who treats, he heals, cripples, but it's all a stage.

526
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:03,279
Then once, he does something which he thinks it's treating, but it's a true miracle.

527
00:53:03,501 --> 00:53:04,474
He totally breaks down.

528
00:53:04,941 --> 00:53:05,574
It's a shock.

529
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:12,917
So things are here much more refined, in the sense that, what does it mean to believe?

530
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:19,160
Often, people who believe, believe with a distance.

531
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:30,659
I often notice how religious people often pray and obey the ritual, not as Pascal thought, in order to really believe.

532
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:35,918
You know that advice of Blaise Pascal to unbelievers who want to believe.

533
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,356
You don't believe, here it is what you should do. Simply act as if you believe.

534
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:46,637
obey the ritual, kneel down, pray, do good works, and belief will come by itself.

535
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:50,017
I claim, unfortunately, that often it's the exact opposite.

536
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:57,178
It's that what if you really believe, but in a too intense way, it's horrible directly to believe?

537
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:05,253
Then maybe the solution is do as if you believe, and your belief will be externalized in the ritual out there.

538
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,258
You no longer will directly have to believe.

539
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:11,995
Now let's move to more problematic topic.

540
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:29,529
This gap between what we rationally know and what we unconsciously believe tells us, I claim, a lot about our predicament, namely how we relate usually to the prospect of ecological catastrophe.

541
00:54:31,481 --> 00:54:32,417
This is a paradox.

542
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:36,339
Basically, we know catastrophe is coming.

543
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,336
there will be global warming, whatever.

544
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,474
But why don't we act?

545
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,376
Why don't we do something?

546
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:48,276
I don't think it's enough, this simple leftist explanation, yes, big companies, manipulation, whatever.

547
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,454
I claim we know, but we don't believe.

548
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:56,797
That is to say, imagine yourself reading a report on global warming, horrible this, that.

549
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:01,659
But then you go out, you see sun, trees, grass.

550
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,716
My god, you say, but this cannot really disappear.

551
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:18,678
That's the tragedy, that what prevents us from taking seriously the prospect of ecological catastrophe. It's precisely our direct immersion into our life world.

552
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:23,100
These are beliefs which are part of the way we act in reality.

553
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:26,217
And it's extremely difficult to renounce them.

554
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:32,778
There is a very important theoretical consequence to be drawn from this paradoxical one.

555
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:41,899
You know the usual criticism of why we are in ecological deadlock.

556
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,257
The idea is the following one.

557
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,378
We trust too much science, abstract scientific reasoning.

558
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:50,778
We should not forget that science is secondary.

559
00:55:51,160 --> 00:56:00,319
It's alienated secondary product of our primordial attitude which is our being embedded in a concrete life world.

560
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:05,178
You see, you feel, you sense with the earth where you live, and so on.

561
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:09,219
But I claim that that's not enough.

562
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:15,396
We cannot return to this immediate life world experience, because this exactly is the problem.

563
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,539
If we are to confront properly, I claim, ecological catastrophe,

564
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:26,276
we have to confront, we have to outgrow precisely this direct embeddedness.

565
00:56:26,881 --> 00:56:27,990
Now let's go on.

566
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,497
I hope it will be a little bit more amusing what I say now.

567
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,599
Namely, how, then, do we relate towards this?

568
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:45,458
Where do we detect this gap in our beliefs or knowledge, this inconsistency?

569
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:48,075
I know it's true, but nonetheless, I don't believe it.

570
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,396
Let me make a simple observation.

571
00:56:50,740 --> 00:57:00,397
Did you notice how every normative order, in the sense of rules that we obey, in order to be members of certain collective,

572
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:07,635
from family to whenever you want, is never a simple set of rules that you learn them you are in.

573
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,514
What's so interesting is that there are never simply only rules.

574
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,600
There are always rules and then meta rules.

575
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:23,208
That is to say, rules which tell you how to relate to these rules, to take them seriously or not, how seriously.

576
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:28,359
For example, it's often that there is a prohibition.

577
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:29,672
You shouldn't do it.

578
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:37,194
But we all know that it usually means, in many cases, do it discreetly.

579
00:57:37,761 --> 00:57:45,174
Or sometimes, especially with some kind of sexual prohibitions, it's even a direct solicitation, do it or whatever.

580
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:51,678
So then can be prohibitions which are not meant to be taken seriously.

581
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,019
If you take them seriously, you appear an idiot, how should I put it.

582
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,000
Like, you are here a little bit different.

583
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,657
You take your state seriously.

584
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:04,129
For example, this is my legacy from the socialist regime in my country, no?

585
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:12,520
Like, if I try not to pay taxes to find a loophole, and if somebody tells me, how can you?

586
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,056
We have to pay taxes all.

587
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:15,911
I mean, the guy is an idiot.

588
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:17,568
You know what I mean?

589
00:58:18,301 --> 00:58:18,383
OK.

590
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,478
But there is something much more interesting here.

591
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:22,872
the opposite paradox.

592
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:34,057
The paradox not of prohibition which between the lines tells you do it, do it discreetly, whatever, but do it, but an offer of freedom.

593
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:41,379
You are permitted something, but on condition that you don't use this option.

594
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:46,932
As if you can do it, you are given the freedom to do it on condition that you will not do it.

595
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:53,058
Again, there are especially, for example, in different political regimes.

596
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:57,331
You have freedom to choose on condition that you make the right choice, that's the truth.

597
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:00,435
Or even in our daily lives.

598
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:09,536
For example, recently a friend from Japan told me, do you know that in Japan workers have the right to 40 days holiday every year?

599
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:15,739
But you are expected not to use this right in its full extent.

600
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,075
The implicit rule is not more than 20 days.

601
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,432
Then I asked them, OK, but then don't you simply write 20 days.

602
00:59:23,322 --> 00:59:24,398
He told me, you are an idiot.

603
00:59:24,541 --> 00:59:25,218
You don't get it.

604
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:25,997
And he was right.

605
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:26,813
I didn't get it.

606
00:59:27,221 --> 00:59:27,587
Why not?

607
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:42,398
It's the same as, do you know, this is always what fascinated me, because I think this is communication between people at its most mysterious and elementary, these empty gestures.

608
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,917
You are offered something, but you shouldn't use it.

609
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:49,718
For example, all of you probably were already in this situation.

610
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:54,478
you were invited by somebody older, richer, to dinner.

611
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,471
Now, you knew it was absolutely clear in advance that he will pay.

612
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:06,580
But isn't it kind of a ritual of politeness that you have to insist for some time, no, no, let me pay.

613
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:09,499
Just don't do, by the way, what I did once I insisted too long.

614
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:12,857
And then the guy said, if you won't, do it.

615
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,938
Then I have to stage all this comedy off.

616
01:00:16,221 --> 01:00:18,880
Oh my god, I forgot my credit cards or whatever.

617
01:00:20,246 --> 01:00:22,939
But there are other beautiful examples.

618
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:31,616
For example, she is my friend, although we fight all the time theoretically, personally she is my friend, Judith Butler.

619
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:41,997
Recently I met her in Switzerland and I was not too rude to her, but I used some degenerate grip, whatever, I'm horrible when I eat.

620
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,756
So I saw that I did hurt her.

621
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:47,658
So I felt bad afterwards.

622
01:00:48,001 --> 01:00:48,611
I phoned her.

623
01:00:49,261 --> 01:00:49,936
I called her.

624
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:51,197
I told her, sorry, blah, blah.

625
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:54,660
And then she told me, thanks, I appreciate it.

626
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,337
But really, I wasn't offended.

627
01:00:56,641 --> 01:00:57,816
I knew you didn't mean it.

628
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,516
You owe me no apology.

629
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,095
She was absolutely sincere.

630
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,980
And I was really grateful.

631
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:12,876
But you see, the paradox is that it was possible for her to say, you owe me no apology, only after I did apologize.

632
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:14,875
And this is not hypocrisy.

633
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:17,657
That's the mystery of communication.

634
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:20,758
You do something, the result is nothing.

635
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:25,138
You do something which is declared superfluous.

636
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:29,575
But in order to be declared superfluous, you have to do it.

637
01:01:31,001 --> 01:01:33,558
This is how now you will say, what's the profit?

638
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:40,994
The profit is respect, friendship, love, communication, through communication, through communication between us.

639
01:01:42,441 --> 01:01:42,791
I don't know.

640
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,320
My favourite example even here is we have this ritual in my country, let us say that

641
01:01:47,581 --> 01:01:50,696
I and a friend of mine compete for the same job.

642
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,195
Let us say he wins, I lose.

643
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:05,178
It's a ritual in my country that then the winner should say to the loser, listen, I know that you deserved it more, why don't I step down and you will get the job.

644
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,615
But of course you have to say no, no, no, you can have it.

645
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,270
What's the profit?

646
01:02:10,941 --> 01:02:13,456
the friendship is saved in this way, frankly, no?

647
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:25,826
So what I'm saying here is that the most delicate texture of our human relations moves, operates at this level,

648
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:39,750
at the level not of explicit rules but of this between the lines rules, you know, like I give you an offer but these meta rules tell me it's an offer to be rejected or whatever.

649
01:02:39,802 --> 01:02:44,396
And now I come to the concluding point, if you allow me a little bit of time.

650
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:53,399
It is that I claim that what is going on today, what worries me, is that these unspoken rules,

651
01:02:53,800 --> 01:03:13,895
what I would call following Hegel, the ethical substance of our being, this I claim is slowly surely, if you want, is disintegrating today.

652
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:20,098
There are some profound changes operating at that level.

653
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:21,291
What do you mean by this?

654
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,018
Let me take a book which I, as an atheist, should like, but I'm not.

655
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,172
I think it's a horrible book.

656
01:03:26,981 --> 01:03:30,318
It was a big New York Times bestseller around a year ago,

657
01:03:30,761 --> 01:03:33,237
Sam Harris, The End of Belief.

658
01:03:33,841 --> 01:03:35,100
It tells all the title.

659
01:03:35,181 --> 01:03:43,920
The thesis of the book is our, and he It means specifically our religions of the book, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and so on.

660
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,216
Beliefs are ridiculously out of date.

661
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:48,938
They belong to a totally different epoch.

662
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,258
Today, they only cause ethnic slaughter and so on.

663
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:54,219
So we have to outgrow them.

664
01:03:54,420 --> 01:04:03,394
And all he allows is some kind of a vague Buddhist, whatever, oriental meditation with no epistemological commitment.

665
01:04:05,121 --> 01:04:11,637
But I think there is something significant here, that precisely the guy who claims this, the end of belief,

666
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:18,549
is also the guy who advocates the use of torture in this book.

667
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:26,000
And it's interesting to take a look at how does he justify torture.

668
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:33,957
Because the point is to find exactly what is wrong in his reasoning.

669
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,635
His reasoning is very simple, basically.

670
01:04:37,601 --> 01:04:39,078
He starts with this problem.

671
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:52,876
Why is it that most of us find it more problematic, much more problematic, to torture somebody in front of us than to push a button which will kill hundreds of thousand people out there, out of our sight?

672
01:04:53,400 --> 01:05:00,038
He claims he calls this the moon illusion, in parallel with this old perceptual illusion.

673
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:05,440
If you don't know how it is, you think the moon is just a small object out there in the sky.

674
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:12,374
But he said, in the same way that we know now rationally that moon is a quite large object,

675
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:18,556
that we should do the same restructuring of our ethical experience.

676
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:21,217
So for him, it's a pretty horrifying conclusion.

677
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:24,618
The fact that we cannot torture, most of us at least,

678
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,558
somebody face to face is simply, I quote him,

679
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:37,576
the reason for this inability to torture another person is every bit as neurological as those that give rise to the moon illusion.

680
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,672
So simply, let's grow up.

681
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:44,177
Let's learn to put things in proper proportion.

682
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:48,998
And following a ruthless utilitarian calculation,

683
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:58,558
let's become aware that it's even your duty, as he puts it, to torture somebody in front of you if in this way you can prevent much larger suffering.

684
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:05,237
Now, Harris concedes that, nonetheless, we cannot simply outgrow our deeply ingrained habits.

685
01:06:05,621 --> 01:06:09,993
So he proposed something which I think is even more tasteless, a kind of a truth pill.

686
01:06:11,441 --> 01:06:18,594
Here is how he says, a drug that would deliver both the instrument of torture and the instrument of its utter concealment.

687
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,118
The action of the pill, OK, I will cut it short.

688
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:29,374
The idea is a pill which causes indescribable suffering, but not visible from the outside.

689
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,310
You have a terrorist.

690
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:37,338
You, instead of torturing him there, which would make you feel bad, you give him the pill.

691
01:06:37,701 --> 01:06:41,777
And the terrorist, suspected terrorist, just seems to take a half an hour nap.

692
01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:43,098
But then he awakens.

693
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,293
And I confess everything you want, no?

694
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:52,979
The first thing that bothers me here is that how this fits perfectly our postmodern logic of,

695
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,536
which I develop in many of the books, of decaf coffee.

696
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:00,918
We like today's projects, sorry, objects, products,

697
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,057
without paying the price for them.

698
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:05,059
Coffee, but decaf coffee.

699
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:06,837
Beer, but beer without alcohol.

700
01:07:07,201 --> 01:07:08,799
A cake, but fat-free cake.

701
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,096
And don't you think that this is only for products?

702
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:16,856
I claim it's exactly the same in our intersubjective relations.

703
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:22,080
Colin Powell's theory of war was precisely decaffeinated war.

704
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:25,019
war, but no victims on our side.

705
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:27,377
And to be a little bit more nasty,

706
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:37,759
I would say that at least the way it is in its predominant form, multiculturalist tolerance is the tolerance of, to be nasty, the decaffeinated other.

707
01:07:37,981 --> 01:07:38,084
No?

708
01:07:38,661 --> 01:07:40,019
The other is abstracted.

709
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:47,200
For example, I think this is the filthiest form of racism to celebrate Native Americans, if you call them that.

710
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:53,999
I found this disgusting, even more racist than Indians, because I spoke with one of them, and he told me, Native Americans, what is this?

711
01:07:54,181 --> 01:07:55,080
Are we part of nature?

712
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,635
What are you, cultural Americans?

713
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:04,420
And he said, to be called an Indian, at least then my name is a monument to white men's stupidity.

714
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,637
No, like, they thought better.

715
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:08,572
They thought they are in India, no?

716
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:13,239
But did you notice how these politically great guys,

717
01:08:13,621 --> 01:08:27,278
if you hear them talk about Native Americans, it's, you know, people who live in a holistic way, harmony with nature, have their dances spiritually connected to Earth, nothing about torture, family rapes, whatever.

718
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:35,979
And I don't say this in, I think, so what I want to say is that this is for me, this cleansing of the other is the most racist thing.

719
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:40,035
So back to this, this is the first problem I have with Sam Harris.

720
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:44,778
The second problem, but it's just a minor remark, is that, fine, so we are following KGB.

721
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:52,278
Namely, I learned in a book about the misuses of psychiatry in Soviet Union that they already had it.

722
01:08:52,600 --> 01:09:02,579
The standard way to torture dissidents there was under the mask up, because there in Soviet Union in the last decades, dissidents being critical of the system

723
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:09,357
was defined as a special form of social schizophrenia or whatever, no megalomania that you can create.

724
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:16,799
They injected something here in the region of your heart, and it was a terrifying experience.

725
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,138
It slowed down your heartbeat.

726
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,154
You thought, like, you know, you are slowly dying.

727
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,019
From the outside, you just took a nap.

728
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,017
It's exactly what Sam Harris described.

729
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,078
From the inside, it was a nightmare.

730
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,374
But, but, now I come to the truly central point.

731
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,959
Nonetheless, you will say, but what's the point?

732
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,855
What is fundamentally wrong with Harris?

733
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:49,817
Here we come to the topic of what in Judeo-Christian tradition, and Freud also refers to this tradition in his theory of how we relate to others, we call the neighbor.

734
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:54,556
The neighbor is something very radical in Judeo-Christian tradition.

735
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,877
The neighbor is not the other who is like us.

736
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,479
The neighbor is some kind of a traumatic presence.

737
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:07,537
It's the other person, if you want, in the abyss of its infinity.

738
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:10,657
And there is always something monstrous about it.

739
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,879
But the name of that monstrosity is freedom, no?

740
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:17,756
You cannot ever be sure you promised me this, but how do I know?

741
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:21,119
How do I know that I can trust you, and so on?

742
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:24,973
Which is why we need promises with people which are not neighbors.

743
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:35,138
If I were to know you totally, in a kind of a cognitivist or brain sciences dream, that I know the mechanisms, how you decide, I wouldn't need promises.

744
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:40,934
Promises are here because precisely I don't know what an abyss you are.

745
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:51,298
And I think we should be very careful here not to, how should I put it, not to idealize the notion of the neighbor.

746
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:58,338
There is something irreducibly traumatic in the notion of the neighbor, which is why a little lesson in theology.

747
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:06,558
If you look already at the Old Testament, I claim that the true function of the 10 commandments

748
01:11:07,682 --> 01:11:15,199
It's not so much to enable you to love your neighbor, but also to keep a neighbor at the proper distance.

749
01:11:15,461 --> 01:11:19,878
It can be very unpleasant, intrusive to come too close to it.

750
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:20,442
Why?

751
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,340
Let me give you a simple example.

752
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:26,877
I hope you were, but it's not as loving as it may appear.

753
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:35,356
You were, some of you at least, I hope most of you all, in a situation where somebody declared intense love to you.

754
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:42,059
approaches you and you see that it's sincere, it's not a joke, you are the center of my life, I totally love you,

755
01:11:42,083 --> 01:11:49,483
admit it if you are honest that maybe you enjoyed it but for a split of a second at least you were horrified.

756
01:11:49,540 --> 01:12:03,859
I mean it's something horrifying to be in such an intense way the focus of all desires of another person, which is why, do you know that William Butler Yeats famous poem like

757
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:08,656
You walk, be careful how you walk because you are walking in my dreams.

758
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:18,100
It's horrible to be somebody who as a real person walks in a dream of dreams of another person.

759
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:21,158
It's a very claustrophobic experience.

760
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:27,838
So again, this topic of neighbor is crucial, abyssal topic.

761
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:35,899
I even claim that we are basically, Our basic fear is fear of the neighbor.

762
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:40,799
And all racisms play upon this, this abyss of the other.

763
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:48,875
And that's, incidentally, one of the sad things, for me at least, going on today, namely the fact of how,

764
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:57,497
did you notice how in the last two, three decades, our politics is defined by two, three features?

765
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:10,753
One is that the only way to mobilize people, not just to do this technocratic administration, but to mobilize people passionately, is to play on a fear.

766
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:15,258
The only politics of passions today is a politics of fear.

767
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:18,538
And unfortunately, not only for the right, also for the left,

768
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:27,617
fear of immigrants, fear of, I don't know, fear of ecological catastrophe, fear of the state high taxes, whatever you want, fear of sexual depravity, and so on.

769
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:33,434
I claim what is beneath this is effectively fear of the neighbor.

770
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:42,695
Another thing to be noted here is how sad thing about today is then how do we deal with the neighbor?

771
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:47,599
You cannot simply swallow him or her.

772
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:56,999
Neighbor is out there in its abyss, which is why, again, I claim that this notion of love thy neighbor, it's something very radical.

773
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:01,959
It means love thy neighbor, love this radical otherness.

774
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,511
Not just love somebody who is like me.

775
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:11,000
It's that today, the way we deal with it is tolerance.

776
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,720
And here, I'm sorry, I don't have time.

777
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:14,537
Maybe tomorrow morning at the restraint seminar,

778
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,820
I want to go with it because I'm now in intense dialogue with that wonderful book.

779
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:24,516
but I have my critical with Wendy Brown's book on regulating aversion.

780
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:29,980
She draws, nonetheless, wonderful conclusions and asks the right questions.

781
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,235
Namely, the basic problem is the following one.

782
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:39,613
Why is the category of tolerance universalized to such an extent today?

783
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:57,417
Did you notice how problems which 20, 30, 40 years ago were perceived not as problem of intolerance, but problems of injustice, inequality, and so on, are today rephrased as problems of tolerance.

784
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:09,878
Racism is today, you don't tolerate my way of life, whatever, but make a stupid experiment, the moment of glory of United States Martin Luther King, the fight for racial equality.

785
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:19,336
I made a simple experiment, go to internet, put some of his speeches, and put tolerance in tolerance, practically absent.

786
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:22,657
Martin Luther King didn't fight for tolerance.

787
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:27,980
He fought for end of exploitation, end of injustice, inequality.

788
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,430
That was the problem for him.

789
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:37,459
I mean, it would be even obscene and racist to say for him, oh, we blacks want whites to tolerate us.

790
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:44,795
You know, it's the same ridicule as to say, as if a eminist would have said, we want men to tolerate women.

791
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:49,537
Which is even a very obscene idea, like many of my male friends would have said,

792
01:15:49,941 --> 01:15:53,740
I can somehow grant equality to women, but tolerate them never there.

793
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:56,335
So OK, that's another story.

794
01:15:57,201 --> 01:16:03,019
What's underlying this is something that should be called culturalization of politics.

795
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:11,252
In our postmodern era, where economy is more and more reduced to something that experts do, just administration.

796
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:18,240
The only conflicts that remain are perceived as conflicts of culture.

797
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:26,079
But now, really, sorry to conclude, this notion of neighbor is something terrifying, I claim.

798
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:26,970
In what sense?

799
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:36,858
In the sense that, again, neighbor is not the wealth of another person, as we put it, his or her inner life, what I see in you.

800
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,376
No, this level is usually a lie.

801
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:44,355
There is a wonderful poetic, but I totally reject it.

802
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,718
Multicultural phrase, which is something like this.

803
01:16:48,021 --> 01:16:49,499
It's supposed to be a deep insight.

804
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,894
I think it's precisely pseudo-depth.

805
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:57,059
It's an enemy is someone whose story you have not heard.

806
01:16:57,361 --> 01:17:01,799
It sounds so noble, you know, like you are my enemy if I just objectivize you, you there.

807
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:10,519
But oh, if I take care or make the effort of understanding you from within, oh, then I will see that you have your standpoint.

808
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:13,880
OK, up to a certain level, this is undoubtedly true.

809
01:17:14,021 --> 01:17:15,797
But I claim only up to a certain level.

810
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:22,197
And the limits are clear if I simply paraphrase this or apply to a very specific case.

811
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:28,360
Would you also be ready to say Hitler was our enemy because we didn't hear his story?

812
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:32,480
I did hear his story.

813
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,056
I read Mein Kampf and so on.

814
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:46,798
And what shocks me is how no matter how horrible your politics is, you always can find a nice way, as we usually put it, to rationalize it, to tell yourself a story about it.

815
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:56,037
So the radical conclusion here is that, and I think this is another deepest insight of Judeo-Christian tradition,

816
01:17:56,540 --> 01:18:02,876
is that the ultimate truth, the truth of you as a unique person, where you really stand,

817
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:10,038
is not when you go deep into yourself and the deepest sincere self-identification or whatever.

818
01:18:10,401 --> 01:18:12,378
At that level, we usually lie.

819
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:14,112
That's not the ultimate truth.

820
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:21,356
Which is why, if you want to get this point, I advise you to read two books.

821
01:18:22,441 --> 01:18:26,359
One is Aldous Huxley, the English guy, gray eminence.

822
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:34,997
It's the story of Father Joseph, Per Joseph, the foreign minister of Cardinal Richelieu in the early 17th century, the 30 years' war.

823
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,258
What's so fascinating in this person?

824
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,898
He was, for that epoch, evil incarnated.

825
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:55,798
The worst realpolitik manipulator, he concluded a pact between Catholic France and Protestant Sweden against Catholic Austria to prevent unification of Germany.

826
01:18:56,420 --> 01:19:00,619
So we can even say he's guilty for Hitler in a certain way.

827
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:07,098
Because it was because of his political plotting that German was not unified earlier as a nation state.

828
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:11,838
We all know this is what caused First World War and so on.

829
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:13,371
Now, what is the shock?

830
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:30,237
The shock is that the same person ordering tortures, poisoning, blah, was, in the evening, after his work was done, was writing the most precious of incredible depth mystical meditations.

831
01:19:30,561 --> 01:19:35,434
Absolutely, how should I put it in a vulgar way, top level, at the level of Santa Teresa, whoever you want.

832
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:38,739
And this is what bothered Huxley.

833
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,136
I think his solution is wrong, but this gap.

834
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:47,417
The same, Let's Go to the East, a simple book by Brian Victoria, Zen at War.

835
01:19:47,921 --> 01:19:48,619
The same problem.

836
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:55,299
We have undoubtedly authentic Zen Buddhist monks, like the one who was very popular.

837
01:19:55,460 --> 01:20:01,437
If some of you are old enough, in the 60s era, hippies, DT Suzuki, the great.

838
01:20:02,081 --> 01:20:03,132
Yeah, but he was in the 30s, 40s.

839
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:13,099
He was not only totally supporting Japanese militarism, but even was writing justification of it,

840
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:23,139
claiming that for the majority of people, this unconditional obedience of military discipline, you don't think there is order.

841
01:20:23,221 --> 01:20:23,653
You do it.

842
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,899
It's the only way to satori, to enlightenment, to overcoming of your force.

843
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,314
So the same paradox.

844
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:38,558
And I think the lesson of it is very clear that when we who stand in a Christian tradition, when we speak about redemption, blah, blah, all this,

845
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:47,038
is something totally different than this gnostic or pagan perspective of going deep into yourself,

846
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,378
finding this inner truth about yourself, and so on and so on.

847
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:56,737
Precisely, this level of inner truth is a lie.

848
01:20:57,701 --> 01:20:58,897
It's the point of lying.

849
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:03,298
So now, believe me or not, but I will really conclude now very shortly.

850
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,938
So just two concluding points from all this.

851
01:21:06,321 --> 01:21:09,352
Now you will tell me, OK, but this all my relativism and so on.

852
01:21:09,761 --> 01:21:10,458
We don't believe.

853
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,158
You don't know where you believe, blah, blah.

854
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:17,657
But there are people, so-called fundamentalists, who really immediately believe.

855
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:23,459
I don't have time, it will take another hour, to develop the whole line of thought.

856
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,013
My conclusion is they don't believe.

857
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,476
Not that they are not sincere that they treat, they know.

858
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:45,330
That is to say, to be very precise, I claim that belief, what bothers me in at least some type of fundamentalist, is precisely, for example, what's for me problematic in creationism as opposed to evolutionism.

859
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:48,159
It's not that it's wrong, I don't care.

860
01:21:48,560 --> 01:22:05,219
It is that the presupposition is that you obliterate the gap between religious faith and scientific propositions and you treat religious propositions at the same level like

861
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:13,993
Jesus has arisen from the dead becomes a statement like this is the DNA structure of that animal or whatsoever.

862
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:21,529
Which is why I think it's deeply significant that fundamentalists usually don't have any problem dealing with science.

863
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:24,458
They love science.

864
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,658
They all the time try to prove that there is no gap there.

865
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:30,198
You have them in Christianity, creationists.

866
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:31,636
You have them in Islam.

867
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:33,415
You have them among the Jews.

868
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:48,018
For example, I learned that there is a group in Israel which takes literally the prophecy that Messiah will come when a calf will be born with totally red hair.

869
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:55,271
So they say, let's fasten the process and they are making these biogenetic experiments to make it happen.

870
01:22:56,821 --> 01:22:58,696
So you know what's for me?

871
01:22:59,365 --> 01:22:59,610
Belief.

872
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,400
Belief is something different.

873
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:06,718
Belief is, for me, a kind of, there is always an element of a belief which is absurd.

874
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,857
Belief is not, you don't believe in facts.

875
01:23:12,546 --> 01:23:18,424
To say, I believe in Christ, but fuck it, I prefer to sin or I don't take, no, you cannot.

876
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:25,858
It's a belief which is by definition an existentially engaged belief.

877
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:30,096
It's for example, to give a pathetic example, it's ridiculous but it's true.

878
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:33,820
Anna Frank, if you read her memoirs, this is belief.

879
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:39,037
When she writes, in spite of all the horrors that Germans are doing to us, the Jews,

880
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:43,298
I believe that there is a divine spark in every human being.

881
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:46,800
This total counterfactual, crazy gesture.

882
01:23:46,901 --> 01:23:48,192
It's the same with human rights.

883
01:23:49,181 --> 01:23:58,259
Believing in human rights doesn't mean I look around scientifically, analyze people, I see at certain level they all have rights, then I say, oh, OK, I believe.

884
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,938
No, it's a leap of faith.

885
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:02,897
It's a kind of a crazy axiom.

886
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:06,677
You can be white, black, yellow, high, low, stupid.

887
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:14,812
I posit it as a practical axiom, and this engagement is crucial.

888
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:28,417
So the first paradoxical conclusion from this, I claim, is that the true danger of this kind of fundamentalism is not that it's a danger to secular knowledge, if they take over, no science.

889
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:29,632
That doesn't bother me.

890
01:24:30,321 --> 01:24:32,038
It's there the true end of belief.

891
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:35,997
It's belief at its most authentic is endangered.

892
01:24:36,661 --> 01:24:37,920
So what is belief today?

893
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:39,997
Let me go briefly, no, really, three minutes.

894
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:41,777
You are my super ego here, yeah.

895
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:43,125
Briefly back to Holocaust.

896
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:53,316
I claim that what the ultimate lesson of when I spoke about how we shouldn't play this game,

897
01:24:54,060 --> 01:25:00,099
God is the good father up there who somehow manipulates things, and you can trust on him.

898
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,155
Everything will turn out well, and so on.

899
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:11,059
I think that with things like Holocaust, it's obscene to expect, oh, we don't know how, but mysterious are the way of the Lord.

900
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:14,899
It must have some deep meanings that it's somehow justified.

901
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:19,038
I claim, here I follow Shaggles reading of Christianity.

902
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:23,235
I claim that it is what really dies on the cross.

903
01:25:24,441 --> 01:25:26,775
It's not, it's precisely this God.

904
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,737
As Hegel would have put it, God as substance.

905
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:34,316
God as this secret mind which benevolently controls everything.

906
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:41,018
God as whatever we here do, in a kind of higher unity, everything has a secret meaning and so on and so on.

907
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:47,718
Because, I mean, here we should be, if you want to be Christian, be really a Christian.

908
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:59,878
That is to say, it's not that we are here, God is there, and then God from time to time, why not, he sends a messenger, okay, things turn back, come back next time, and so on.

909
01:26:01,381 --> 01:26:10,518
The ultimate lesson of Christianity, of embodiment, incarnation, for me is that God is engaged in our history.

910
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:16,237
What happens here on Earth, it's not something that God observes from above.

911
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:26,719
And the way I read it is that the death of Christ on the cross, which means it's not just the death of a representative of God.

912
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,816
And I think even we should forget all that legalistic topic.

913
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:32,599
God paid the price for our redemption.

914
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:33,266
Oh my God.

915
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,016
Paid to whom?

916
01:26:35,241 --> 01:26:35,757
To devil?

917
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:36,223
To what?

918
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:55,599
It's the death on the cross is precisely the death of that Christ of God as an absolute master which controls everything in a kind of teleological unity so that all our stains are somehow

919
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:00,913
redeemed as contributing to some higher harmony, even if it's unknown to us.

920
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:08,377
God's Christ coming here suffering with us means precisely our suffering is for the real.

921
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:11,575
You cannot redeem it in this stupid way.

922
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:26,579
So what I claim is that something absolutely unheard of happens with Christianity, which is the death of Christ means something very radical.

923
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:32,758
It means in all other religions we trust God, we believe in God.

924
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:36,195
The death of Christ means God trusted us.

925
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:41,137
It means like I give you your freedom, it's up to you.

926
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:48,377
goes for me is literally, I take it literally when it says in the Bible, whenever the two of you are there, I will be there, I am there.

927
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,376
It means the gift of freedom.

928
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:54,079
It means God doesn't want to play that up there guarantee.

929
01:27:54,200 --> 01:28:00,099
It means God entrusts the faith of creation, his own faith into us.

930
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:07,559
It means what happens here is part, as it were, of the history of God.

931
01:28:08,101 --> 01:28:09,917
although I don't agree with Amalo and Levinas.

932
01:28:10,301 --> 01:28:11,597
He made nicely this point.

933
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:15,098
Here, I agree with him, apropos iconoclasm.

934
01:28:15,441 --> 01:28:16,194
Don't misread it.

935
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:20,659
The prohibition to make image of God in Judaism

936
01:28:20,981 --> 01:28:24,419
does not mean, oh, in this gnostic way, oh, it's too mysterious.

937
01:28:24,521 --> 01:28:25,355
We cannot paint it.

938
01:28:25,661 --> 01:28:26,898
It means exact opposite.

939
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:33,917
It means God is alive, not in your stupid deep meditations of up there, but how you react with others.

940
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:39,119
That's why you shouldn't make images, Because it's not an image to be made up there.

941
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:44,220
And I think, if anything even more, this holds for Christianity.

942
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:46,136
That's for me what holy ghost is.

943
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:50,457
God is no longer the substantial master up there.

944
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:55,639
God is, to put it in this way, the spirit of our community.

945
01:28:55,881 --> 01:28:57,517
It's the gift of freedom.

946
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:02,139
I claim, if you don't draw this crazy conclusion,

947
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:07,440
Then, whatever you claim to be, you repaganize Christianity.

948
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:12,457
You fall back at that level of God is up there sending messengers or whatever.

949
01:29:12,861 --> 01:29:17,359
Sorry, but to inform you, although you know this, but Christ is not a messenger of God.

950
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:18,252
Christ is God.

951
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:21,758
I'm just trying to draw conclusions from what this means.

952
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,198
I'm sorry if I was too long.

953
01:29:24,501 --> 01:29:25,879
On the other hand, I'm not sorry.

954
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:26,759
You had to suffer it.

955
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:27,230
That's life.

956
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:28,153
Thanks very much.

957
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:50,126
And we have some time for questions, and what we thought we'd do so that everyone can hear

958
01:30:03,431 --> 01:30:13,846
is we have a couple of microphones here and here, and so if you have a question pertaining to what was discussed and presented, you can cue up to the mic.

959
01:30:15,270 --> 01:30:15,719
If you...

960
01:30:17,194 --> 01:30:22,248
Zizek said we should be a little bit liberal and allow those who would like to end their suffering to leave now, so...

961
01:30:23,034 --> 01:30:24,745
Yeah, liberal, but did you see?

962
01:30:25,450 --> 01:30:26,904
Goldfinger claims gold.

963
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:30,187
You remember that car where you press the button, no?

964
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:33,510
My dream is to have here this kind of a plan.

965
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:38,804
You ask me a nasty question, I press the button, you jump up, and nonetheless.

966
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:43,857
Well, since we don't have that button, or maybe we do, I don't know.

967
01:30:45,033 --> 01:30:46,648
So if you feel like you'd like to leave, feel free.

968
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:51,533
Otherwise, go ahead and we'll try to negotiate back and forth between the two.

969
01:30:54,030 --> 01:30:55,688
Do you want to do or should I?

970
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:57,004
There is a guy there already.

971
01:30:57,551 --> 01:30:57,941
Are we ready?

972
01:30:58,310 --> 01:30:58,856
Oh, OK.

973
01:31:00,491 --> 01:31:08,039
So if you will comment briefly maybe on the connection between what you were talking about earlier and some of your other work in your writings.

974
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:16,585
Maybe something about how in films like Independence Day where we saw the events that would later happen

975
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:22,688
and then we look at movies like the two you mentioned today where we didn't see what we knew happened.

976
01:31:22,990 --> 01:31:24,445
Sorry, which is the second film, I didn't get it.

977
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:32,350
The two you discussed earlier, the two, the flight and the relationship between

978
01:31:32,990 --> 01:31:39,962
the desert storm conflict where we watched the film or the war on television as if it were a film or we were experiencing it,

979
01:31:40,650 --> 01:31:47,785
and the current conflict where we dismiss it with media and just kind of talk about it from the point of view of DC.

980
01:31:48,590 --> 01:31:57,190
There are so many, again, I will be short because it's, I hate you, because it's too good question in the sense to, you know what I mean?

981
01:31:57,230 --> 01:32:00,397
To answer it properly, it's, again, half an hour and so on, no?

982
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:07,002
What I want to say is that, first, when you said like Independence Day, we saw what happens later, no?

983
01:32:07,971 --> 01:32:11,103
My god, many people accused me when I wrote about this in my welcome.

984
01:32:11,950 --> 01:32:17,569
As if I'm some kind of a mean, evil, anti-American and wants to say, you see, you were dreaming about it.

985
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:23,521
So you basically got what you not only deserved, but desired.

986
01:32:25,711 --> 01:32:27,129
Here, things are much more complex.

987
01:32:27,230 --> 01:32:36,423
Because the first lesson of psychoanalysis is that it's also, I think, the title of that last novel of Truman Capote, Unfinished, something along these lines.

988
01:32:37,571 --> 01:32:42,007
The worst thing that can happen to you is that your dreams come true, how should I put it?

989
01:32:42,510 --> 01:32:45,988
The Freudian notion of desire is much more complex.

990
01:32:46,530 --> 01:32:48,342
If you fantasize about something,

991
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:57,469
It is often that the worst thing that can happen is if this fantasy is brutally from outside imposed onto you.

992
01:32:57,810 --> 01:33:02,388
In one of my books, I even make a very unpleasant.

993
01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:12,208
I take a brutal example, but talking with many feminists who first were shocked, but then half accepted it, I'm convinced in the truth.

994
01:33:12,651 --> 01:33:17,547
Namely, you know, now this will be problematic for some of you, but at least listen to the end.

995
01:33:17,990 --> 01:33:22,067
Do you remember this usual phrase of a rapist?

996
01:33:22,871 --> 01:33:24,449
Oh, but she secretly deserved it.

997
01:33:24,590 --> 01:33:27,568
I only gave the bitch what she really was asking for.

998
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:33,183
No, the standard defense is, oh, male fantasy, they dream about it, and so on.

999
01:33:33,990 --> 01:33:38,209
But when they speak frankly, many women will tell you.

1000
01:33:38,510 --> 01:33:44,347
I read many minutes of reports on rape that it is true that there was some kind of desire.

1001
01:33:45,191 --> 01:33:46,389
Now comes my conclusion.

1002
01:33:46,491 --> 01:33:48,088
Does this justify it?

1003
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:48,601
Not.

1004
01:33:48,870 --> 01:33:49,861
It's even more horrible.

1005
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:52,208
What do I mean by this?

1006
01:33:52,471 --> 01:33:56,042
I read in my country some reports on rape, and one thing is clear.

1007
01:33:56,931 --> 01:33:58,387
I do it in one of my early books.

1008
01:33:58,710 --> 01:34:00,670
Imagine this situation, just to get the point.

1009
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:03,704
Of course, it's not as simple as that, but the basic point is like this.

1010
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:07,128
Imagine two women, to simplify to the utmost.

1011
01:34:07,531 --> 01:34:12,629
One is self-assertive, autonomous.

1012
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:16,625
The other is more passive, dreams about being beaten, raped, and so on.

1013
01:34:17,031 --> 01:34:19,106
Imagine both of them raped.

1014
01:34:19,770 --> 01:34:24,583
I claim for the second one, it would have been much more terrifying.

1015
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:30,246
The first one will get over, maybe, I hope so, take even some revenge afterwards.

1016
01:34:30,771 --> 01:34:32,086
For the second one, who?

1017
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:36,488
At a certain level, you can say, oh, she just got what she was dreaming about.

1018
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:39,367
For that one, I fear she may kill herself, and so on,

1019
01:34:39,871 --> 01:34:40,746
I claim afterwards.

1020
01:34:41,010 --> 01:34:52,941
That is to say, there is nothing more humiliating then to get from the outside like stuck into your face the fact of your dreams.

1021
01:34:53,770 --> 01:34:57,707
Because you know, fantasies are a very fragile thing.

1022
01:34:58,410 --> 01:35:04,941
So back to that point, I think this is a different question, but very interesting one.

1023
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:14,810
Why this eternal fascination of the United States with the victory of the enemy from all those fantasies.

1024
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:22,668
And I like them, all those stories where there was, I think, with, I don't know who played in it, a big miniseries some 10, 20 years ago

1025
01:35:23,010 --> 01:35:27,446
where Soviet Union occupied the United States, and then daily life.

1026
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:31,003
And even the last one, I bought it, my god, at the airport now four days ago.

1027
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:35,507
I forgot some Italian sounding author, prayers for the assassins.

1028
01:35:35,910 --> 01:35:38,769
The idea is atomic bombs, blah, blah, blah, war.

1029
01:35:38,970 --> 01:35:41,466
The result, United States falls apart.

1030
01:35:42,311 --> 01:35:53,605
Southeast, Bible Belt Republic, New York, that area, atomic waste, and LA, Northwest in Seattle, Islamic Republic of the United States.

1031
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:59,709
And it's a very nice novel because it doesn't paint Islam simply as bad.

1032
01:35:59,851 --> 01:36:01,950
It tries to imagine how it would have felt.

1033
01:36:01,970 --> 01:36:09,664
But again, the point is, what ideological pleasure do you get from it, no?

1034
01:36:10,510 --> 01:36:13,330
So, OK, I would have to go on too much.

1035
01:36:13,390 --> 01:36:22,828
But to go your other points about where we get, we didn't see, and so on, and so on, I'm not, no,

1036
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:24,789
I will make another point here.

1037
01:36:24,870 --> 01:36:25,822
And that's all I can say now.

1038
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:42,669
I am not saying, maybe I gave a wrong impression, that the true film would have been the one which would have provided a total picture with all historical causes of the events, no, I already hinted a couple of versions of what would have been a more truthful film.

1039
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:46,065
For example, as I said, American 11 instead of United 93.

1040
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:54,444
That is to say, not some kind of Marxist, optimistic, total knowledge, but at least the true despair, how should I put it, no?

1041
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:56,046
At least the true despair.

1042
01:36:57,911 --> 01:37:03,909
And again, this doesn't involve any kind of secret pseudo-leftist justification.

1043
01:37:04,030 --> 01:37:07,068
ha ha, you got what you want, or whatever.

1044
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:17,746
No, it's just, how should I put it, the problem is simply precisely to confront things in all their horror.

1045
01:37:18,150 --> 01:37:31,109
What bothers me in this aggressive, either here Republican attitude, it's a feature which somehow strangely, this idea that you can only tell the story when people fight back.

1046
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:36,728
And you know that this was the same in communist countries.

1047
01:37:37,290 --> 01:37:52,688
It's a strange thing why, when they were dealing with those who survived the concentration camps, the communist regimes always found it a kind of irrational hatred and guilt.

1048
01:37:53,231 --> 01:37:59,829
Usually, all those Russian soldiers who were freed from Nazi camps, most of them were sent to Siberia killed.

1049
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:07,049
or even worse, in my country, Slovenia, part of x-Yugoslavia, we avoided Stalinist show trials.

1050
01:38:07,130 --> 01:38:10,142
But there was one show trial monstrous in 51.

1051
01:38:12,130 --> 01:38:13,467
It was called Dachau trial.

1052
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:20,849
The survivors of Dachau were put to trial, accused of surviving Dachau because they collaborated with the Germans.

1053
01:38:20,930 --> 01:38:23,028
And then there are no English spies, the usual story.

1054
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:31,849
But what fascinated, I think, what is beneath is that the communists couldn't imagine this true despair,

1055
01:38:32,150 --> 01:38:42,868
that there are situations where you can be so humiliated that it's no longer possible this heroic stance, shoot, but I fight back, and so on, no?

1056
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:48,434
They still, it's somehow too embarrassing, unimaginable to them,

1057
01:38:48,458 --> 01:39:02,058
this utter despair embodied in the figure of this nicely described in Agamben's book about Auschwitz, these Muslims, Muslim men, and this living dead, totally broken.

1058
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:06,016
Or to put it in another way, it's a very sensitive topic, but I insist on it.

1059
01:39:08,150 --> 01:39:14,801
Did you notice a strange fact that most of the really good films about Holocaust and so on are comedies?

1060
01:39:15,410 --> 01:39:17,845
I think there is a deeper necessity in it.

1061
01:39:18,671 --> 01:39:19,738
What kind of necessity?

1062
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:23,629
Tragedy can only be written.

1063
01:39:23,871 --> 01:39:29,548
something can be staged, presented as tragedy, when things are not really, truly desperate to the end.

1064
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:38,228
Because in tragedy, you retain a minimum of dignity to play your tragic role with this heroic dignity.

1065
01:39:38,630 --> 01:39:46,760
So a film which would have taken place, for example, in Auschwitz as a tragedy would have been an obscenity, I claim.

1066
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:50,790
It would have given too much credit to the Nazis.

1067
01:39:50,910 --> 01:40:07,706
The whole point is that the terror was so total that it was not possible to do a conflict at the level of tragedy, which is why some of the scenes, if you read Primo Levi, the way he described,

1068
01:40:08,450 --> 01:40:11,327
you cannot but describe them as comical.

1069
01:40:11,770 --> 01:40:22,063
For example, one of the most horrible scenes, read it in, if this is a man when every two months you had in Auschwitz camp a process called selection.

1070
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:27,307
All prisoners have to run naked in front of a SS doctor.

1071
01:40:27,991 --> 01:40:30,027
And the doctor was tired, didn't care.

1072
01:40:30,411 --> 01:40:35,710
Literally, you had two, three seconds to impress the doctor, that you are healthy enough to survive.

1073
01:40:35,810 --> 01:40:41,028
And he simply categorize you to be burned or to allowed to live.

1074
01:40:41,510 --> 01:40:47,410
But there is something obscenely, madly comical in this, how Primo Levi describes this.

1075
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:55,029
You know, like the prisoners were trying to pinch their lips to appear more healthy, more red, their stomachs tried to rise.

1076
01:40:55,290 --> 01:40:59,129
It's kind of a totally crazy comedy, no dignity in it.

1077
01:40:59,350 --> 01:41:01,427
And that's the true horror of it, I claim.

1078
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:06,176
So the same goes for Stalinist show trials, and so on, and so on.

1079
01:41:07,070 --> 01:41:12,703
When in this sense, I claim, and Kierkegaard knew this, Christianity is a comedy.

1080
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:19,061
Christianity, to read crucifixion as a tragedy is an obscenity.

1081
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:21,708
Tragedy is for ancient Greeks.

1082
01:41:22,011 --> 01:41:23,370
For the Christian, it's comedy.

1083
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:29,649
But of course, the whole point being comedy, which is much more nightmarish than more.

1084
01:41:29,870 --> 01:41:32,229
So again, I didn't answer your question.

1085
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:34,769
I know, but there was too much in it.

1086
01:41:35,012 --> 01:41:35,470
I'm sorry.

1087
01:41:35,511 --> 01:41:36,349
I cannot go in there.

1088
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:40,050
Ah, sorry.

1089
01:41:40,050 --> 01:41:40,196
Please.

1090
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:41,315
Thank you.

1091
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:53,528
At the end of your talk, he said that Jesus, by God through Jesus, gives us the gift of freedom, and that is Christianity as you read it.

1092
01:41:55,150 --> 01:42:07,767
That really made me think about an earlier statement you made about the idea of, for example, the paradoxical statements you were making about we have freedom to choose as long as we don't choose it.

1093
01:42:08,150 --> 01:42:12,729
So on some level, can you reconcile that with Calvinism?

1094
01:42:13,631 --> 01:42:19,597
Since we're here at Calvin College, I'm just wondering, are you an atheist Calvinist on some level?

1095
01:42:20,474 --> 01:42:21,250
No, if you, okay.

1096
01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:21,576
Paradoxically.

1097
01:42:22,290 --> 01:42:22,535
Almost.

1098
01:42:23,270 --> 01:42:29,109
If you ask me which religious orientation would be of Christianity, would be closest

1099
01:42:29,370 --> 01:42:40,588
to my spontaneous sensitivity, generally Protestantism, but maybe those who are closer to Protestants among Catholics, Pascal, Poirot, why?

1100
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:43,028
Because we can debate about everything.

1101
01:42:43,310 --> 01:42:52,410
One thing I don't concede, this obscenity that our salvation depends on our good acts.

1102
01:42:52,630 --> 01:43:07,212
I think this is an obscenity for me, an obscenity in the sense that this then introduces an irreducible aspect of, you know, as if, oh God, okay, if I make this, will it be okay that of kind of economic exchange or whatever.

1103
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:08,581
It has to be predestination.

1104
01:43:09,811 --> 01:43:12,388
That's where I totally agree with it.

1105
01:43:12,650 --> 01:43:18,105
And now comes the point, oh my God, I hate you, why are you asking me two good questions?

1106
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:24,808
Have you thought about this paradox, I've written about it, which is a crazy paradox,

1107
01:43:25,490 --> 01:43:44,253
namely how we all know Max Weber, capitalism, Protestantism, but if we approach it with a common sense, it would have been that capitalism, as we know, the most dynamic, competitive system in the history of humanity.

1108
01:43:44,350 --> 01:43:48,588
You are up to you, you are autonomous, you work like crazy.

1109
01:43:49,170 --> 01:43:55,489
How is it that this attitude is justified by the notion of predestination, which, if

1110
01:43:56,010 --> 01:44:06,770
you approach it in a common sense way, should have justified precisely the opposite attitude, to be vulgar if everything is decided in advance?

1111
01:44:07,312 --> 01:44:11,070
Why don't I sit down, read pornography, and drink lemonade?

1112
01:44:11,130 --> 01:44:14,408
You know, like, why were everything is already decided?

1113
01:44:14,770 --> 01:44:16,202
So it's mysterious.

1114
01:44:17,291 --> 01:44:27,507
How is it that precisely the awareness that everything is decided in advance pushes us to incessant activity?

1115
01:44:28,191 --> 01:44:35,308
My answer would be here problematic for some theologists maybe, but I'm convinced by it.

1116
01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:40,929
that predestination is an extremely refined dialectical notion.

1117
01:44:41,090 --> 01:44:43,247
It's not simply it's written up there.

1118
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:47,406
It's that it's written up there, but you don't know what is written, no?

1119
01:44:47,830 --> 01:44:57,730
And I think that we should make clear here a step further that even say it is written up there, but it is backwards written.

1120
01:44:57,790 --> 01:44:58,435
What do I mean by this?

1121
01:45:00,730 --> 01:45:12,829
There is a very refined paradox which theorists of even some theorists of rational action articulated, of how something may happen or not.

1122
01:45:13,330 --> 01:45:19,507
But if it happens, retroactively it appears that it had to happen from the beginning.

1123
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:32,289
For example, all good histories of the Roman Civil War, Julius Caesar, and so on, will tell you how once Caesar won, everybody saw it as a destiny, no?

1124
01:45:32,670 --> 01:45:38,126
But it is as if things are not necessary from the beginning.

1125
01:45:39,650 --> 01:45:46,086
So that the paradox is that if a thing happens, you have to say retroactively that it had to happen.

1126
01:45:46,851 --> 01:45:47,562
Retroactively.

1127
01:45:48,191 --> 01:45:50,169
And this brings me to another.

1128
01:45:50,330 --> 01:45:54,290
I love, as a Marxist, I love religious conservatives.

1129
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:56,246
You find intelligent conservatives.

1130
01:45:56,770 --> 01:46:03,087
Like TS Eliot, you know that, my god, if you study English, the most traditional and individual talent.

1131
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:13,404
That famous phrase, the proposition how every great work of art retroactively changes its entire past.

1132
01:46:14,451 --> 01:46:26,766
Or it's the same Borges said something similar in his wonderful text on Kafka, that a modest writer, you can say by whom he or she was influenced, a truly great writer,

1133
01:46:27,410 --> 01:46:30,946
creates its own, his or her own precursors.

1134
01:46:31,931 --> 01:46:39,449
His idea is that, of course, we can say Kafka was influenced by Dostoevsky, Edgar Lampeau,

1135
01:46:39,731 --> 01:46:40,724
William Blake, whatever.

1136
01:46:41,210 --> 01:46:43,045
But it's not as simple as that.

1137
01:46:43,710 --> 01:46:49,987
But to perceive that dimension in Dostoevsky, blah, blah, blah, Kafka already had to be here.

1138
01:46:50,390 --> 01:46:53,688
Now, this doesn't mean we simply retroactively project it.

1139
01:46:54,010 --> 01:47:04,741
I think that this retroactive constitution
of necessity is the key to predestination.

1140
01:47:07,110 --> 01:47:10,047
Predestination doesn't mean we are not free.

1141
01:47:10,530 --> 01:47:21,828
Predestination means that we are, at the much more radical level, free to constitute our very predestination, how should I put it?

1142
01:47:22,130 --> 01:47:23,886
Because that's the paradox of freedom.

1143
01:47:24,410 --> 01:47:27,859
Freedom, here I agree with deepest insights of Protestants.

1144
01:47:28,690 --> 01:47:34,207
True freedom is not, oh, do I want a strawberry cake or a chocolate cake or whatever, this and that.

1145
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:40,164
True freedom is in a way to choose your necessity, how should I put it, no?

1146
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:43,648
True freedom is something much more difficult.

1147
01:47:44,050 --> 01:47:47,646
For example, let's take the ultimate free act, love.

1148
01:47:48,510 --> 01:47:50,326
Of course, love has to be free.

1149
01:47:50,810 --> 01:47:54,938
If somebody tells me you have to love this, that, it doesn't work.

1150
01:47:55,930 --> 01:48:00,606
But it's a strange kind of freedom because at the same time, let me be extremely vulgar.

1151
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:06,149
You notice that I like to be, I use the, it's nice to be hypocritical and put the blame.

1152
01:48:06,210 --> 01:48:10,110
You know, I really don't want to be vulgar but for the sake of argument, sake of argument.

1153
01:48:10,130 --> 01:48:10,353
Okay.

1154
01:48:11,550 --> 01:48:17,567
Let's say if I were to say here are some nice girls, let me fall in love and I look around.

1155
01:48:18,010 --> 01:48:19,969
Ah, you have nice hair, my legs like that.

1156
01:48:20,130 --> 01:48:22,849
OK, the most percentage, it's you.

1157
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:25,848
No, I will not point at anyone, not to be accused of harassment.

1158
01:48:26,210 --> 01:48:28,547
And it doesn't work, isn't it?

1159
01:48:29,010 --> 01:48:32,266
The whole point of love is that it is free,

1160
01:48:33,070 --> 01:48:34,844
the freest maybe act of all.

1161
01:48:35,670 --> 01:48:39,128
But what kind of, how do you experience it?

1162
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:44,360
All of a sudden, you experience it as I cannot do otherwise but that.

1163
01:48:44,950 --> 01:48:46,429
That's my necessity.

1164
01:48:46,510 --> 01:48:47,184
I have to do it.

1165
01:48:47,470 --> 01:48:53,050
And it's the same with all great acts of freedom, not through chocolate cake or strawberry cake.

1166
01:48:53,090 --> 01:48:55,948
But for example, you are in a difficult predicament.

1167
01:48:56,330 --> 01:49:03,648
There is war, or let's say in Europe, Nazi occupation, whatever, to decide to fight it, to engage in fight.

1168
01:49:04,030 --> 01:49:07,188
It's probably the utmost free decision.

1169
01:49:07,630 --> 01:49:15,267
But it's not that when you decide for it in a way, or for example, for a white man here in the 50s

1170
01:49:15,790 --> 01:49:26,190
to really do it, not as a white liberal signing protests up there in New York, but like those white men who were killed here, to come really not here, we are up down there in the south.

1171
01:49:26,251 --> 01:49:31,123
Sorry, I still think, I thought that I was where I was two days ago in the south.

1172
01:49:32,410 --> 01:49:36,641
To go really down there and risk to be killed supporting the blacks and so on.

1173
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:40,767
It's obscene to say, oh, I was free to decide, I decided.

1174
01:49:41,390 --> 01:49:47,323
You decided because in some way you sense that you would be ashamed of yourself, you cannot do otherwise.

1175
01:49:48,110 --> 01:49:55,348
This is the deepest sense, not this neurological sense, when you think you are free, you are controlled by your neurons.

1176
01:49:55,690 --> 01:50:03,928
This is the deepest sense in which the highest freedom is assuming inner necessity.

1177
01:50:04,490 --> 01:50:13,608
So I know, again, that I didn't answer you, but here you see how I relate very intensely to all this topic of predestination and so on.

1178
01:50:14,050 --> 01:50:34,809
And definitely, definitely, I think that all the, how to put it, I even, now I'm writing a book on Hegel and Christianity, where I try to develop this, my god, I will be hated for that again, was this political, how very Eurocentric, unashamed, and pro-Protestant.

1179
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:38,507
First, we have Eastern Orthodoxy,

1180
01:50:39,190 --> 01:50:49,768
which for me is, I mean, as Christianity, I mean, Russian church, that orthodoxy, not John Milbank, not here, radical orthodoxy, neither East Buddhism, but that one.

1181
01:50:53,411 --> 01:50:55,689
I'm very uneasy with that one.

1182
01:50:55,790 --> 01:51:06,608
Because first, this whole, I think they secretly change Christ into kind of an idol, a mere ideal to be imitated.

1183
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:10,330
And then in the long term, we all can become Christ.

1184
01:51:10,410 --> 01:51:15,667
You know, this idea of man becoming God, gradually we will all becoming God,

1185
01:51:16,111 --> 01:51:22,148
connected with another problem which I find very problematic in Orthodox Christian church.

1186
01:51:22,730 --> 01:51:41,846
The notion of this distinction between what they call economy and God in itself, as if you can distinguish in God the inner mystery, trinity, of God himself and economy, which is basically to be cynical public relations, how God deals with humanity.

1187
01:51:42,370 --> 01:51:49,785
But I think that what gets lost here is simply the deepest Christian insight, which you find in,

1188
01:51:51,230 --> 01:52:01,969
at its purest only in Protestantism and some maybe of those mystics like Meister Eckhart, who got it, that what is the deepest insight of them?

1189
01:52:02,190 --> 01:52:06,730
it's that we are part of God's history, how should I put it?

1190
01:52:06,811 --> 01:52:08,184
It's not God up there.

1191
01:52:08,850 --> 01:52:13,228
So I claim that Catholicism, you have more this symbolic exchange.

1192
01:52:13,390 --> 01:52:15,605
You deal with God, institution, and so on.

1193
01:52:16,511 --> 01:52:22,407
I quite naively believe, so here I'm totally for it, that only with Protestantism did

1194
01:52:22,990 --> 01:52:33,928
Christianity, again, to use this nice Hegelian dialectical formulation, only with Protestantism Did Christianity become what it always truly was, as I put it?

1195
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:43,168
Here again, you have this nice paradox, which is properly Christian Hegelian dialectical paradox, that there is eternity.

1196
01:52:43,490 --> 01:52:49,228
But eternity is something which can become through time.

1197
01:52:49,811 --> 01:52:55,225
Not simply that it wasn't there, it becomes what it always already was.

1198
01:52:56,350 --> 01:52:57,844
OK, I'm sorry if I was wrong.

1199
01:52:58,611 --> 01:52:59,869
Again, these are serious problems.

1200
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:02,969
If you come again, you can tell us what toilets are like in Slovenia.

1201
01:53:03,197 --> 01:53:03,447
Thank you.

1202
01:53:03,814 --> 01:53:05,030
Germans, we are disgusting Germans.

1203
01:53:05,051 --> 01:53:05,649
That was a joke.

1204
01:53:05,752 --> 01:53:06,169
Next person.

1205
01:53:06,210 --> 01:53:07,443
We are disgusting Germans.

1206
01:53:08,191 --> 01:53:09,197
Sorry to inform you.

1207
01:53:11,210 --> 01:53:12,787
I've got a very simple question for you.

1208
01:53:13,090 --> 01:53:14,888
Oh my god, this will be the really nasty one.

1209
01:53:15,110 --> 01:53:19,888
You already got asked the question about Calvinism.

1210
01:53:20,430 --> 01:53:28,938
But going back to your presentation and the scope of human suffering and how that all kind of fits or it doesn't fit with Christianity.

1211
01:53:30,950 --> 01:53:33,165
To me, kind of, you stopped at crucifixion.

1212
01:53:33,951 --> 01:53:46,047
And I find it kind of narrowing to talk about Christian tradition at large without the resurrection, how resurrection fits into what you just said or how it doesn't fit.

1213
01:53:46,411 --> 01:53:46,680
It does.

1214
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:53,726
But here, maybe I'm a little bit too much in favor of some kind of materialist rereading, no?

1215
01:53:54,450 --> 01:54:02,199
I mean, resurrection is, for me, what I quoted, that when the two of you will be there and love between you, I will be there.

1216
01:54:03,030 --> 01:54:06,827
Resurrection, for me, is the Holy Ghost.

1217
01:54:07,530 --> 01:54:12,263
You don't need any Christ to meddle things up there, Hersey.

1218
01:54:12,450 --> 01:54:17,446
OK, so your definition of Christian Protestantism will be more of the 19th century liberal tradition.

1219
01:54:17,991 --> 01:54:18,728
Oh my god, no.

1220
01:54:19,091 --> 01:54:25,200
If we were to be, sorry to tell you this, But if we were to be in Soviet Union in the 30s,

1221
01:54:27,811 --> 01:54:33,925
even before you would reach home, you would disappear in a camp of re-education, five years minimum.

1222
01:54:34,330 --> 01:54:39,230
No, seriously, because no, my god, I'm Kierkegaardian here.

1223
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:51,708
And the greatness of Kierkegaard is that people usually misread Kierkegaard because they misread him as if his point was no, not institution, but inner faith, absolutely not.

1224
01:54:52,110 --> 01:54:55,128
Kierkegaard is, this is for me, the miracle of Kierkegaard.

1225
01:54:55,571 --> 01:55:11,164
He knew very well in his critique of what he called Christendom, the Christianity as institution, that the solution is not this liberal attitude of what it only truly matters is your inner faith.

1226
01:55:11,670 --> 01:55:13,426
OK, let me give you a radical answer.

1227
01:55:13,910 --> 01:55:16,726
If I were to choose, OK, I'll do it this way.

1228
01:55:17,370 --> 01:55:24,704
I have many friends who are this kind of half closet materialist closet believers, and they even don't know in which closet they really are or whatever.

1229
01:55:25,690 --> 01:55:28,910
I ask them, I like this brutal, do you believe or not?

1230
01:55:29,030 --> 01:55:32,349
The usual answer I get is really not.

1231
01:55:32,490 --> 01:55:37,941
I don't like institutions, but there is something deep in me, maybe some force, blah, blah, blah.

1232
01:55:39,610 --> 01:55:41,320
I have no mercy for this.

1233
01:55:43,190 --> 01:55:48,102
To me, what is much more sympathetic, what interests me is precisely church as an institution.

1234
01:55:49,950 --> 01:55:53,085
Church as an institution, which is why what interests me is Protestantism.

1235
01:55:53,451 --> 01:55:55,147
It's not this, me and God.

1236
01:55:55,490 --> 01:55:58,308
No, it's Gemeinde, it's the community.

1237
01:55:58,590 --> 01:56:06,489
That's absolutely crucial for me, which is why, for example, I totally agree with that basic Protestant insight.

1238
01:56:06,710 --> 01:56:09,169
What does it mean, read Bible alone?

1239
01:56:09,410 --> 01:56:13,881
It doesn't mean kind of inner orgasm of meditation, blah, blah.

1240
01:56:14,371 --> 01:56:16,468
It means God's work for me.

1241
01:56:16,770 --> 01:56:18,783
Read Bible means precisely

1242
01:56:19,870 --> 01:56:21,922
You cannot bypass logos.

1243
01:56:23,350 --> 01:56:26,048
This is even the limitation for me of all those mystics.

1244
01:56:26,370 --> 01:56:34,806
Like, great as he is, but Meister Eckhart cannot really deal with incarnation, with Christ.

1245
01:56:36,011 --> 01:56:48,609
Did you notice how the whole operation of Meister Eckhart, his mystical rereading of Christianity, is based on this basically treating with works?

1246
01:56:48,890 --> 01:56:55,206
I think you have been letting this ambiguity mundus, now it can means pure and world.

1247
01:56:55,950 --> 01:57:05,167
So here it is, God sends his son into mundus whatever, not as into the world, but into the purity of our virgin soul.

1248
01:57:05,770 --> 01:57:08,270
I think you lose everything in this way.

1249
01:57:08,330 --> 01:57:23,450
But going back so that I don't get lost, to your point, what I'm especially opposed to is this secular humanist notion of this Feuerbach version of you, it doesn't matter what you believe,

1250
01:57:23,771 --> 01:57:36,749
Christianity is more a kind of an ideal, you know, it's really we just project into it our highest human desires, what is most noble in us, and so on and so on.

1251
01:57:36,950 --> 01:57:53,529
No, I think it's absolutely crucial to insist, I cannot develop it now, that man is not enough to, you must have a dimension which is more radical than only a man in man,

1252
01:57:53,910 --> 01:58:05,428
and I cannot go now into it theoretically, but even in psychoanalysis, I claim, this is the function of a concept which is deeply misunderstood, the concept of death drive.

1253
01:58:06,050 --> 01:58:14,787
Death drive is not this, oh, I want to die, disappear, or some kind of crazy destructive drive paradoxically, I claim is Freud's name for immortality.

1254
01:58:15,370 --> 01:58:21,583
If you really want to understand what is death drive, forgot about all this nirvana stuff and think about Stephen King.

1255
01:58:22,210 --> 01:58:22,763
You know what I mean?

1256
01:58:23,191 --> 01:58:26,589
This undead, in the sense of death, but living death.

1257
01:58:26,790 --> 01:58:30,428
Something which insists beyond life and death.

1258
01:58:30,830 --> 01:58:37,867
So again, in this sense, sorry for my tastelessness, but you got my point, in this sense,

1259
01:58:38,350 --> 01:58:45,168
No, I'm definitely opposed to this, how should I put it, this soft religious humanism.

1260
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:50,622
Who cares, institutionally, just that you are sincere and that whatever, no.

1261
01:58:51,310 --> 01:58:56,706
No, no, no, here I am a strict Kierkegaardian, who, again, what Kierkegaard got,

1262
01:58:57,290 --> 01:59:06,206
and this was a great, almost, I would say, Marxist insight by him, is that wasn't, you know, better this than me, wasn't a big target of Kierkegaard's

1263
01:59:08,675 --> 01:59:14,770
was some big state theologist, I forgot the name, who was precisely this kind of a liberal.

1264
01:59:15,231 --> 01:59:23,630
And what Kierkegaard got is that there is no opposition between this kind of flat,

1265
01:59:24,191 --> 01:59:31,710
cheap, bleeding heart humanism and being the worst conformist state philosopher.
