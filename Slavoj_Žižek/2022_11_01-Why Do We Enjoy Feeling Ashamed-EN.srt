1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,400
Good evening, everybody.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,140
I'm Professor Russell Spriglia from the English Department.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,860
And looking out into the audience, I see many who were in attendance last time.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:23,220
Tonight's distinguished speaker, Sloboj Žižek, visited us here at Seton Hall, which was just a little over four years ago now, back in October of 2018.

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:35,180
So, because many of you are already familiar with him, rather than giving the typical academic introduction, you know, listing his many academic positions,

6
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,320
his most significant books, the, you know, the movies he's starred in, et cetera, et cetera.

7
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:49,240
I'm just going to cut to the chase and simply say that Slavoj Zizek, who is visiting us all the way from Ljubljana, Slovenia tonight,

8
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:58,440
is not only among the most recognized and recognizable academics in the world today, but also among the most important and most indispensable.

9
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:08,940
And so we're very fortunate to have him here with us again tonight, and I'd like to begin by thanking him, first of all, for coming back to see us at Seton Hall.

10
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:18,240
This event is cosponsored by the Provost's Office, the Dean's Office of the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Department of English.

11
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:27,100
So I'd like to take this opportunity to also thank Provost Katya Passerini, Associate Provost and my colleague in English, Jonathan Farina,

12
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,740
Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, Jerita Frierson,

13
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,160
Assistant Dean of Finance and Administration, Sheila Riley,

14
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,880
and last but certainly not least, my department chair, Angela Wiesel.

15
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,180
All of these people were instrumental in helping to make sure that this event came through.

16
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,200
I'd also like to thank Michael Riccardelli, Olivia Lason,

17
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,420
Eva Rose Menino, Michael Suppios, and Christopher Petruzzi,

18
00:01:53,444 --> 00:02:02,944
all of whom helped either to promote this event or to make sure that we were able to properly livestream it and record it for those who are unable to be here with us in person tonight.

19
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:10,300
So I'm not going to presume to anticipate Slavoj's answer to the question posed by the title of his talk,

20
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:28,380
why do we enjoy feeling ashamed, but what I would like to do before turning the microphone over to him is to very briefly provide a bit of framing or cognitive mapping For those who might be a little bit puzzled or perplexed by the title, why do we enjoy feeling ashamed?

21
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:35,600
And this, the idea for doing this came from as a direct result of my personal experience while promoting the event.

22
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,380
While I was out and about putting up flyers for it across campus, around town,

23
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,720
sharing it on various social media sites and platforms,

24
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,440
the most common response I got, honestly, I would say like seven or eight out of 10 people,

25
00:02:50,464 --> 00:02:59,764
as they looked it over and saw the title, they immediately responded, I don't enjoy feeling ashamed.

26
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:08,700
Now, as someone who works in psychoanalytic theory, and this is all Slavoj's fault, he's a direct influence of Slavoj,

27
00:03:08,724 --> 00:03:19,324
he's my greatest teacher, whenever I got this response, I couldn't help but think of one of Freud's famous anecdotes, and it's one Slavoj likes to tell.

28
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,320
You know, Freud has a patient, and he asks him,

29
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,040
in response to the question, you know, who is, well, Freud asks him, who is that woman in your dream?

30
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,920
And the response is, I don't know who that woman was, but I'm sure it wasn't my mother.

31
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:45,480
And for Freud, this response, this is like a quintessential example of what he calls negation, or wennienung in German.

32
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:51,780
And he goes on to say that, you know, this response, Such a response, it settles the matter, you know, immediately.

33
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,520
Beyond the shadow of a doubt.

34
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,560
We can absolutely be sure that the woman in this patient's dream was his mother because of that response.

35
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,740
So when the vast amount of, you know, the majority of people responded to this, you know, while they're seeing the title.

36
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,460
You know, I don't enjoy feeling ashamed.

37
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,040
I was so tempted to be a good Freudian and say, well, it's settled then.

38
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,120
You clearly do enjoy feeling ashamed.

39
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,400
But I didn't end up doing that actually for the record, so.

40
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,620
Okay. Now, very briefly, I'm going to close this introduction shortly.

41
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:31,660
But for those who responded in this way, you know, in the classic form of negation, the problem lies, of course, with the term enjoy, right?

42
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:39,100
With the suggestion that one could possibly enjoy feeling something as mortifying as shame.

43
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,620
In much the same way, you know, Freud's patient preemptively

44
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,740
dismisses the idea that the woman in his dream, you know, was his mother, because it would indicate some repressed, you know, oedipal desire for her.

45
00:04:52,240 --> 00:05:00,260
But what's absolutely crucial to stress here, and is there's a difference between enjoyment in the common everyday senses

46
00:05:00,284 --> 00:05:05,884
that we use the term like enjoying a nice cup of coffee in the morning or a sunset in the evening.

47
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,120
And enjoyment in the psychoanalytic sense,

48
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:19,440
this is what, you know, Freud's greatest ambassador, Jacques Lacan, he designated the term in French, which there's no good English equivalent.

49
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,500
Enjoyment is close, but it's not quite good enough.

50
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,200
The term jouissance, which is an enjoyment,

51
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,600
as Freud would have put it, that is beyond the pleasure principle.

52
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:39,740
It's an unconscious enjoyment in the repetition of something that, you know, undermines yourself, is not in your best interest.

53
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,160
So it's a pleasure in pain.

54
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,980
It's not a, you know, a common sense of enjoyment.

55
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,260
So I just want to conclude by stressing that out.

56
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,360
It's very important to keep in mind that fundamental distinction between the common everyday use of it

57
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:58,984
and this jouissance of excessive traumatic enjoyment that you don't really enjoy in the classic sense.

58
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,980
So, okay, I've talked long enough.

59
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,240
I've made you wait long enough.

60
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:09,620
So I'm just going to stop and ask you to please join me in welcoming back to Seton Hall my good friend, the one and only Slavoj Zizek.

61
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,970
I'm glad to be here again.

62
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,150
I hope not the last time.

63
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,770
But let me first address a technical problem.

64
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:35,490
Was it only my problem or your voice had a strange echo?

65
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,610
It was a little bit difficult for me to follow it clearly.

66
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,470
Can you follow me clearly?

67
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,210
It works.

68
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,650
Okay. Okay.

69
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,290
It will be a relatively long talk with some video clips, so I hope not too boring.

70
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,210
Let me begin.

71
00:06:51,050 --> 00:07:01,730
I want to begin with a well-known scene from Hitchcock's rather, Alfred Hitchcock's rather bad film Torn Curtain from 1966.

72
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:09,150
The only outstanding scene in the film is that of the murder of Gromek,

73
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:24,530
Stasi, Stadzicherkeit, his German secret police officer who suspects that Armstrong, played by Paul Newman, the movie's hero, did not sincerely defect to the East.

74
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:35,350
So Gromek follows Armstrong to a loan farm where Armstrong went to make preparations to return to the West.

75
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:50,970
Gromek realizes that Armstrong is a double agent And as he is calling the police, a tortuous struggle begins that ends with Gromek being brutally slain by Armstrong.

76
00:07:53,750 --> 00:08:05,970
The by far best scene in the movie, which as Hitchcock put it, shows how difficult it is to kill a man.

77
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:12,870
Gromek's head is pushed into a gas oven where he slowly suffocates,

78
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,750
desperately waving his hands.

79
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,850
Can we have the first?

80
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:24,450
It's four minutes long, but you will see what I will, that you draw from that scene.

81
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,950
Why did I show you this clip?

82
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:42,030
My point has nothing to do with the content, But I want to draw your attention to a shocking fact that I discovered only recently.

83
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:48,030
Gromek, the bad guy, is played by Wolfgang Kieling,

84
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:53,450
who was at that time a well-known West German movie and TV star.

85
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,990
He acted also in some other Hollywood productions.

86
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,250
And here comes the surprise.

87
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:20,130
During the post-production of this movie in Hollywood in August of 1965, the so-called Watts race riots took place, which were brutally suppressed by the police.

88
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,210
There were around 50 people dead.

89
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,410
And you know what happened in real life?

90
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:36,510
Killing the actor became disgusted with American society and as a result,

91
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:43,470
after the film was released, he defected to East Germany in real life,

92
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:57,170
calling the United States, quote, the most dangerous enemy of humanity in the world today guilty of crimes against the blacks and the people of Vietnam," end of quote.

93
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,510
The irony of his case is sublime, sorry, supreme.

94
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:14,430
The production of a movie about a fake defection to the east to communist East Germany led to an actual defection to East Germany.

95
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:29,410
A truly dialectical approach to the Cold War, I think, has to give space also to such peculiarities which disturb the simple opposition of democracy and totalitarianism.

96
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:34,070
Today's killings, not to kill, but Wolfgang killings,

97
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:39,050
are precisely people like Assange or Snowden,

98
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:47,870
who although he didn't want to found years ago, you remember, the only safe place to stay in Russia.

99
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:53,310
He is well aware that the reasons have nothing to do with Russia's love of freedom.

100
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,370
But these are paradoxes that we witness today.

101
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:08,070
And such an approach is needed, again, especially today, when our disorientation is generalized.

102
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,810
Events we should be ashamed of occur everywhere.

103
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,190
But should we be ashamed?

104
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,970
How does shame function today?

105
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,310
In his two revelations on shame,

106
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:39,270
the Austrian philosopher Robert Faller convincingly refutes two common notions about shame, shame as opposed to guilt.

107
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:44,930
The idea that shame comes from outside in contrast to guilt,

108
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:51,310
which is your inner feeling and that shame comes from my failure,

109
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,430
from being not good enough.

110
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,770
Guilt comes in different grades.

111
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:05,150
It involves rational argumentation, counter argumentation and the possibility of pardon.

112
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:14,650
While shame overwhelms us all of a sudden, we just wish to disappear, no rational way out is offered to us.

113
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:21,150
Now, Fowler demonstrates how the role of shame changed in today's culture.

114
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:33,470
Shame is no longer the shame of failure or weakness, but the shame of an obscene too much, too muchness, which can be success itself.

115
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,830
I am not ashamed of my lack or insufficiency.

116
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:45,190
I myself appear to myself as an obscene excess, an element out of place.

117
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:51,210
I just want to disappear, sink into ground because I'm too fat,

118
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,370
because I emit flatulence in public, whatever you want.

119
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:09,530
So the subject perceives itself as an obscene excess, as an element that lacks its own place in the symbolic order, which defines the coordinates of our reality.

120
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:15,330
Shame is not triggered by not enough, but by too much.

121
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,370
It comes from below, not from above.

122
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:34,230
This is also why the weird agency of what Fowler called innocent observer is an agent of pure appearance

123
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:44,630
and the duty of our ego is to maintain the appearances to prevent that the innocent observer will notice them.

124
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,390
What do I mean by this?

125
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,730
Fowler deploys the functioning of this innocent observer perfectly.

126
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,470
Shame doesn't arise when all know about the painful matter.

127
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:04,190
Shame bursts out only when an as-is, as if we don't know, breaks down.

128
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:13,310
When the attempt to maintain a public secret fails, shame arises in everybody who is present."

129
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,770
This means that shame is not simply external.

130
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,370
I can feel ashamed also when I am alone.

131
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:33,790
What we call manners or tact means that we learn to pretend that the big other didn't notice the disturbing element.

132
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:47,350
This role of the innocent observer, the guardian of appearances, also accounts for the strange fact that I can feel shame for others who should be ashamed of themselves.

133
00:14:47,970 --> 00:15:07,690
When the innocent observer registers the excess, we all feel equally ashamed since it became obvious that we all knew the reality and just discreetly ignored it.

134
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,570
Again, let me further clarify this.

135
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:22,810
Let's say that somebody in a closed social circle, like behind a large table, does something socially inappropriate, like emit a loud flatulence.

136
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:30,550
The proper thing to do is not to smile at him kindly with the message, okay, you did it, no problem.

137
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:37,390
The proper thing is to ignore it totally, to go on as if nothing happened.

138
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:42,730
Now what do I mean by this agency of pure appearance?

139
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:54,450
You were, I was often in a situation, let's say again there are four or five people and you know something dirty, dramatic about one of the persons there.

140
00:15:54,890 --> 00:16:01,150
You know and you know that everybody else knows and they all know that everybody knows.

141
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:09,690
But, nonetheless, the moment you mention publicly this fact, everybody is ashamed.

142
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:19,350
This is the best case, I think, or example of what Lacan means by the big other, the agent of appearances.

143
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,490
Now let's go to politics.

144
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,550
Stalinism is perhaps the clearest political case of such an innocent observer.

145
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:33,910
However, we all know how absolutely crucial appearances were in Stalinism.

146
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:42,530
The Stalinist regime reacted with total panic whenever there was a threat that appearances will be disturbed.

147
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:55,170
Let me just recall why, I wonder if you knew this, why it never reigned during the first of May parade in Moscow in Stalinist times.

148
00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:04,950
The authorities feared that the rain disturbing the parade would be perceived as an indication that the Communist Party is not all-powerful.

149
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:13,370
So they sprayed the sky above Moscow with gases which prevent the formation of clouds.

150
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:24,590
What characterizes Stalinism is precisely this conjunction of raw, brutal terror and the need to protect appearances.

151
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,310
Even if we all know something is not true,

152
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,310
the big other of appearances should not notice it.

153
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:50,050
That's why from 1956, the 20th Congress of Communist Party when Khrushchev rendered publicly some of the Stalinist crimes was such a trauma.

154
00:17:50,050 --> 00:18:00,150
You know that there were doctors in the background and carefully controlling it.

155
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:07,170
There were six to seven direct heart attacks, but why?

156
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,730
Nobody learned anything new.

157
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,270
The shock was that this was rendered public.

158
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,790
So where are we with this today?

159
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:23,190
Let me take a recent example, maybe you know this clip from China.

160
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:33,550
The process of choosing seven members of the standing committee of the Politburo, the real seat of power in today's China, is totally obscure.

161
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,030
It happens behind closed doors.

162
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:49,490
But at the last Congress, now a couple of weeks ago, an unexpected crack appeared in this monolithic edifice.

163
00:18:50,270 --> 00:19:07,810
The former, before Xi, Chinese President Hu, Xi's predecessor as the party leader was unceremoniously dragged off stage shortly after foreign media came in.

164
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:16,630
He looks disoriented and as two assistants help him stand, he speaks briefly with Xi'

165
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,030
whom he had been sitting next to in the front row.

166
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,750
Don't be afraid, this is one minute even less.

167
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,410
Why I found this almost a historical event?

168
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:48,290
Although the official comment just mentioned afterwards the bad health and momentary weakness of Hu, Hu is dragged out, whose resistance and defiance were clearly visible.

169
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:53,110
For a moment, the smooth appearance was disturbed.

170
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,310
Why did this happen?

171
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,630
There is, and discreetly friends from China told me this,

172
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,950
it wasn't that who was resisted,

173
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,530
she's total power and wanted to protest.

174
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,470
No, it was all staged.

175
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:16,110
So, I like this point that the very disturbance of perfect appearance was staged.

176
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:36,910
The first indication is that this incident occurred one minute after cameras from international TV were turned on, so that the whole world saw it.

177
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:41,690
So the mask of appearance did not fall down.

178
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,490
It was intentionally taken down.

179
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:51,910
He himself staged this incident to render visible his brutal power.

180
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:59,550
However this reading indicates that the new Chinese leadership can no longer cling to

181
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:10,310
undisturbed appearances, it has to disturb them to assert its full authority.

182
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:18,350
Again, I think this is a very pessimist sign because you know Chinese were really obsessed by undisturbed appearance.

183
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:31,170
To give you another example, you know the big introductory at the beginning parade which took place a couple of years ago, six, seven, when there were the Summer Olympics in Beijing.

184
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:41,990
They were staged by Zhang Ki-mo, maybe you know him, the popular Chinese movie director who did Hero and other movies.

185
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,010
But you know what?

186
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:43,790
The shock.

187
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,130
The Chinese were the party.

188
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,730
They were so afraid that something will go wrong

189
00:21:53,370 --> 00:22:06,470
and disturb the appearance that while the real parade went on what the world saw on TV was a pre-recording of earlier staging of the same parade.

190
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:12,750
so that they could be absolutely sure that nothing will go wrong.

191
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,630
So let me go on.

192
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:27,450
So they wanted to, they experienced if the perfect appearance is disturbed, it's shame.

193
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,710
It's total shame.

194
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:29,970
It shouldn't happen.

195
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,890
And again, as I already said,

196
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:42,190
this is what I found nonetheless fascinating, especially with regard to what goes on today in classical communism.

197
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:45,770
Again, as I already said, it's extremely brutal,

198
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:56,270
but at the same time it's incredibly afraid of the slightest disturbance.

199
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:10,430
And I had, when I was much younger, in late 70s, I was the editor, one of the co-editors of a journal and we published some poem.

200
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:21,950
We thought nothing special, but then some lines it was possible to read them as a veiled critique of the communist party.

201
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:26,150
And there was a special meeting of the central committee.

202
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,290
There was a panic in the party.

203
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,230
No wonder.

204
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:35,670
I think it was Brodsky, the Russian immigrant poet, who said,

205
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:39,330
and in some sense, it's not just a cynical joke.

206
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:48,990
It's true that at no time in human history, poetry was held at such high place than in Stalinism.

207
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:53,570
People got shot for a wrong line in a poem and so on.

208
00:23:54,010 --> 00:24:06,110
The irony of my case was that if there were to be no panic from the party, nothing would have happened, nobody would have noted that stupid poem.

209
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,930
So now I come to the point that you mentioned.

210
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:18,630
The excess which causes shame is profoundly linked to some kind of surplus enjoyment.

211
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:30,150
I feel shame when doing something that I secretly enjoy, like the same tasteless example emitting flatulence.

212
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,250
Plus, and this reflexive term is crucial,

213
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,650
I enjoy this shame itself.

214
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,630
In some of his acts, but not all of them, Trump,

215
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,390
Donald Trump, acts without shame.

216
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,910
The liberal leftists feel shame for him.

217
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:54,770
And this shame attributed to others is It is, in itself, a source of pleasure.

218
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:58,890
I enjoy others feeling shame for what I am doing.

219
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,310
However, Trump's shamelessness is not unlimited.

220
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:08,490
Say, he would never shamelessly claim he is bisexual or gay.

221
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:16,870
In his eyes, those whom he dismisses as non-patriotic should be ashamed of themselves.

222
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:26,450
But in contrast to the liberal left, Trump would not feel himself ashamed on behalf of what the left is doing.

223
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,630
And what about today's woke left?

224
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:38,030
I think Fowler is right to point out that we often have shame instead of argumentation.

225
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:51,630
Instead of a rebellious, enlightening left, ready to debate every question with its enemy since it feels assured about its better arguments,

226
00:25:51,654 --> 00:26:03,054
now a fussing pseudo-left appears which fears argumentative confrontation and wants to close the mouth, especially to its own people.

227
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,210
End of quote.

228
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:09,510
So I think the lesson of this is that shame is simply not reliable.

229
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:15,850
You mentioned to me this afternoon in Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer.

230
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:22,510
You remember that wonderful moment when Tom does a good thing.

231
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,670
He helps, I think, the black.

232
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:26,610
Sorry?

233
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,290
A Huck Finn does this, yeah.

234
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,750
I was always on Huck Finn's side, his bed, yeah.

235
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:41,190
He helps the black Jim, the slave, escape, but he feels ashamed of it.

236
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:49,130
It's an obvious case of how the truth is here on the side of his act, not his inner feeling.

237
00:26:49,130 --> 00:27:03,070
So we should move from shame to critical examination of the entire situation including shame itself.

238
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:14,570
Yes, the first step should be it's horrible when you see no shame when something shameless is happening.

239
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,270
But then we should go on.

240
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:22,770
So, let me give you an example of this, which again, there is nothing obscene, violent,

241
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,170
but it shocked me.

242
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:33,990
Now, a week ago, on October 23rd, a video clip was released which reportedly shows

243
00:27:34,014 --> 00:27:47,814
the Russia's Chechen Republic leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, being given three Ukrainian prisoners of war by his teenage son.

244
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:52,150
His teenage son, his three sons, 16, 14 years old, went,

245
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,210
that's the official myth, as volunteers to Ukraine.

246
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:03,930
And they got, came back with three prisoners and they give them as a present to his father.

247
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,070
Short clip, very short clip.

248
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:16,690
16 years old kid gives his father three prisoners as a gift,

249
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:22,670
as if prisoners of war are private property and even miners can own them.

250
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,950
Plus, what I found most shocking is the fact that this is publicly,

251
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:32,390
that this is recorded and publicly displayed.

252
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:37,770
I mean, the question is how can something like this happen?

253
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,550
This utter obscenity.

254
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:44,030
But what about the Western folk left?

255
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,650
Now comes trigger warning.

256
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,030
You will probably not agree with what I will say.

257
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:59,110
Towards the end of October of this year, Gonville and Caius College in Cambridge.

258
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:15,070
Cambridge, not here, Massachusetts, England, was hosting a talk by Helen Joyce, known for her view that men and women are being redefined by trans activists, with laws and policies

259
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:24,710
reshaped to privilege self-identified gender identity over biological sex.

260
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:29,490
Joyce unambiguously supports trans rights.

261
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:46,910
What she rejects is gender identity ideology, the idea that people should count as men or women according to how they feel and what they declare instead of their biology.

262
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:57,530
Now, students at this college have launched protests with the college's LGBT plus representatives

263
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:08,930
demanding that Joyce's appearance be cancelled because they are unanimously disgusted by the platforming of such views.

264
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:27,570
Shooters were even opening a safe space, welfare, tearoom for students during the talk, blaming understandable hurt and anger for many students, staff and fellows caused by this invitation.

265
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:41,830
The college's master joined them saying that while freedom of speech is a fundamental principle People on some issues which affect our community, we cannot stay neutral.

266
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,990
Now first my theoretical position here.

267
00:30:45,670 --> 00:31:00,250
I disagree with both polls in this conflict because I think the opposition between biology and what I feel and declaring what I feel is not exhaustive.

268
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:11,170
Where, and here is my criticism of some of this free choice of gender ideology, where is Freud here?

269
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:19,630
Where is the Freudian subject of the unconscious, which is neither biological nor a matter of feeling?

270
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:28,710
We become sexual subjects when our biological features get mediated by complex symbolic structures.

271
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:33,830
Structures which work at a different level than our feelings.

272
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:37,970
No matter how sincere, feelings may deceive.

273
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:52,790
But nonetheless, I think that debating the role of biology or social symbolic structures in the formation of our sexuality is a legitimate topic.

274
00:31:52,790 --> 00:32:07,330
How fragile the opponents of Joyce's appearance must be if they experience such a debate as something so threatening that they even need a safe space to protect them?

275
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:19,290
Is it not that their refusal of debate betrays a fear that such a debate may render palpable the weakness of their position?

276
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:35,070
Plus, are they aware that the logic of my identity is what I feel, if I feel a man, a woman, a trans, and I declare what I feel, can also be used in a directly racist and sexist way.

277
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:48,630
A full-blooded heterosexist would also need a safe space to avoid LGBT plus persons by whom he is anonymously disgusted.

278
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,830
I'm not agreeing with him.

279
00:32:52,150 --> 00:33:03,110
I just claim again that this idea of my identity is what I feel, immediately experience and declare.

280
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:10,530
It proceeds as if there was no Freud, no divided subject,

281
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,150
no psychoanalysis and so on and so on.

282
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:22,730
Duane Roussel, my Canadian friend, characterizes woke as racism in the time of the many without the one.

283
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:29,490
This may appear problematic, but I think it hits the mark in an almost exact opposite

284
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:42,670
to the traditional racism which fights against a foreign intruder posing a threat to the of the one, say immigrants and Jews to our nation,

285
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:55,110
Vogue reacts to those who are suspected not to truly abandon all forms of the one, patriots, proponents of patriarchal values, and so on.

286
00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:09,170
With all its declared opposition to the new forms of barbarism, the Vogue left fully participates in it, promoting and practicing a flat discourse without irony.

287
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:14,950
Although it advocates pluralism and promotes difference,

288
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:19,530
its subjective position of annunciation,

289
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:23,770
the place for which it speaks, is extremely authoritarian,

290
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:30,930
allowing no debate and imposing exclusions, which are often based on arbitrary premises.

291
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:45,070
In all this mess, we should always bear in mind that the woke stance and cancel culture are de facto limited to the narrow world of academia

292
00:34:45,094 --> 00:34:49,994
and up to a point some intellectual professions like journalists.

293
00:34:50,050 --> 00:35:01,910
While society at large moves in the opposite direction, cancel culture with its implicit paranoia is a desperate

294
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:14,134
but also inefficient attempt to compensate for the actual troubles and tragedies of the LGBT plus individuals.

295
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:19,290
The violence and exclusion to which they are permanently submitted.

296
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:20,950
I'm well aware of this.

297
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:29,570
But I think that precisely, cancel culture is a retreat into a cultural fortress,

298
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:41,494
a pseudo-safe space whose discursive fanaticism lives intact and even strengthens the resistance of the majority to it.

299
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,570
So you got my point.

300
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:48,930
I'm not attacking woke and cancel culture as being too fanatical and so on.

301
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:56,190
I claim precisely that behind this mask of fanaticism, stringency, it's a compromise.

302
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,950
It doesn't really change social reality.

303
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:18,010
Now on the opposite side, the hidden tension of the conservatives who reject the idea that sexual identity is a discouraged social construct becomes palpable

304
00:36:18,034 --> 00:36:24,634
where in the panic with which they reject the project of the LGBT plus education,

305
00:36:24,658 --> 00:36:35,258
which should present to a child all options of sexual identity, they, conservatives, patriarchal, binary and so on,

306
00:36:35,282 --> 00:36:51,082
they fear that if children are to be educated in this way, they might be influenced to betray their natural sex and choose some unnatural form.

307
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:56,390
This is why recently Russia prohibited all gay and LGBT propaganda.

308
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:04,790
In short, I don't know if it happens also in your country, it happens in my country all around Europe now,

309
00:37:04,814 --> 00:37:17,114
how again, conservatives are horrified by this idea if you teach young children about LGBT construction or sexual identity,

310
00:37:17,138 --> 00:37:24,238
that this may affect them and that they will effectively become gay, trans and so on.

311
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,470
But the paradox is clear here.

312
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:30,950
They don't believe their own idea that sex is natural.

313
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:37,570
If they were to believe it, they wouldn't be so afraid.

314
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:50,810
Again, if one's sexual orientation is so easily changed by education, does this not imply that sexual identity is a social construct?

315
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,990
So how to break out of this cycle?

316
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,670
Now comes the most problematic part.

317
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:09,250
We got an unexpected hint from Ukraine where something happened recently which may appear a step further in our moral decay.

318
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,670
But I don't think so.

319
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:11,790
I think it's the opposite.

320
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:28,410
On October 13th, it was revealed that more than 15,000 Ukrainians have planned to organize a mass orgy in case Putin launches a nuclear attack on Ukraine.

321
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,490
This is not a joke.

322
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:33,030
I checked it up with my Ukrainian friends.

323
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:45,530
15,000 individuals have registered for this event, which is being called Orgy at Shekavitsa.

324
00:38:45,530 --> 00:39:00,430
The mass event will be taking place, okay now it will not, probably there will be no nuclear bomb, will be taking place in a predesided place on a hill in Chekhovitsa, part of Kiev.

325
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:03,070
It was well organized.

326
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:11,730
People participating have been asked to decorate their hands with stripes denoting their sexual preference.

327
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:20,230
If you want anal sex, you have three stripes on your hand.

328
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:27,490
If you are interested in oral sex, you have four stripes and so on.

329
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:35,710
The reaction of participants is those who are registered, it's noteworthy.

330
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:46,170
One woman told a reporter, it's the opposite of despair. Even in the worst case scenario, people will look for something good.

331
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,730
This is the mega optimism of Ukrainians.

332
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,070
And similar groups popped up.

333
00:39:54,050 --> 00:40:01,530
For example, an orgy on Deribasivka Street in Odessa and so on.

334
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:13,530
Now, one should take notion of collective orgy as a life-affirming project in the time of extreme despair.

335
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:23,130
No need here for a deeper pseudo-Freudian analysis of the disintegration of civilized social links in a traumatic time.

336
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:34,490
The truly non-civilized procedure is what Russia is doing, giving its soldiers Viagra to rape Ukrainian women,

337
00:40:34,514 --> 00:40:49,714
UN envoy Pramila Petin reported that rapes and sexual assaults attributed to Moscow's forces were part of Russia's military strategy.

338
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:52,290
That's the true horror for me.

339
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,750
How comes that Russia is doing this?

340
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,930
We have to go a little bit deeper.

341
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:08,150
Simply, the rule is that everything is permitted in the struggle called by Putin and his ideologists – Satanists.

342
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:14,290
The term regularly used in the Russian media has to be taken seriously.

343
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:21,510
Alexey Pavlov, Assistant Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation,

344
00:41:21,534 --> 00:41:38,334
is now calling for the de-Satanization of Ukraine, saying that there were hundreds of sects in the countries of sects where citizens have abandoned orthodox values.

345
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:48,970
I believe that with the continuation of our special military operation, it becomes more and more urgent to carry out the de-Satanisation of Ukraine.

346
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:59,130
The new regime turned Ukraine from a sovereign state to a totalitarian hyper sect.

347
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:04,930
Putin echoes the same stance, quote from Putin.

348
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:11,570
This is a complete denial of humanity, the overthrow of faith and traditional values.

349
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:22,370
Indeed, the suppression of freedom itself has taken on the features of a religion, outright Satanism."

350
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:35,550
No wonder that Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, called Putin a fighter against the Antichrist and chief exorcist.

351
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:42,550
Some people ask how Russia, still a normal state, can ally itself with fundamentalist Iran.

352
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:49,110
But we can see now that, if anything, Russia is more fundamentalist than Iran.

353
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:53,330
Now I raise my stakes and make us go a step further.

354
00:42:54,050 --> 00:43:07,270
What is, I think, even more morbid than Russia's brutality and this open ideology of fighting You know that now the goal, again, this is not official discourse in Russia.

355
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:11,370
It's no longer denazify Ukraine, but de-Satanize.

356
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:17,090
What is even more morbid for me are some leftists,

357
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:30,550
personics working for peace, who claim that now is the time to send a big European delegation to Russia to inquire and negotiate about the terms of peace.

358
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,310
Please, my comment.

359
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:39,670
I hope you all know the well-known joke evoked by Freud on the borrowed kettle.

360
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:45,430
First, let's say I borrow a kettle from you.

361
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,090
I return it to you broken.

362
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,190
And then you said, what, it's broken?

363
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:57,090
And my defense is, first, I never borrowed a kettle from you, second, I return it to you unbroken.

364
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:02,810
Third, the kettle was already broken when I got it from you.

365
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:08,910
Do those who oppose hectic Ukraine with arms not fall prey to a similar paradox?

366
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:12,350
Their arguments clearly fall into three categories.

367
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:25,370
First, abstract superego reasoning. Giving arms never stops the war. It's like pouring oil on fire. So it's always immoral and murderous.

368
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,430
That's the abstract position.

369
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:33,050
Then you have a more concrete listing of particular arguments.

370
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:44,610
Okay, Russia committed a horrible crime by invading another state, but Ukraine is also not innocent, so we cannot put the blame only on one side and so on and so on.

371
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:50,770
And third, more and more popular in Europe and in United States, direct egotism.

372
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:57,930
Why getting involved in a war far away which will only hurt our interests and living standards?

373
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:03,850
And let me make another argument against pacifism.

374
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:10,330
Yes, of course, my God, I'm scared like shit of nuclear war.

375
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:19,130
But at the same time, don't forget that all occupiers are sincerely always for peace.

376
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:25,150
Peace means I want peace in the occupied territory, leave me alone.

377
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:32,650
Germany, when they occupied France in 1940, of course they wanted peace there.

378
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:37,870
Israel on the West Bank, West Bank is a special case.

379
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:54,290
I oppose terrorist attacks from Gaza or South Lebanon, but on the West Bank, of course Israel want peace, because peace means doing our job, gradual ethnic cleansing of it.

380
00:45:55,330 --> 00:46:06,870
The Pisanics, who are against NATO and sending arms to Ukraine, ignore the key fact that it was Western help that allowed Ukraine to resist.

381
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:10,970
Without it, Ukraine would be long occupied.

382
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:22,170
This help led to today's stalemate which maybe now created conditions for a possible compromise.

383
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:29,510
So in Germany, I admire the stance of the Green Party, which not only advocates support

384
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:41,570
for Ukraine, but also proposes the use of the ongoing oil and gas crisis as a unique opportunity to make our industries greener.

385
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:44,070
You see, I like this stance.

386
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:50,710
Most of us, for most of us, the problem is just, OK, it's dramatic, we should help them, but not too much.

387
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:53,290
How will it disturb our way of life?

388
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:56,370
We are used to live in a comfortable way.

389
00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:11,150
Is it not a much better position to say, but why don't we use this situation to make our industry is greener for an ecological turn and so on and so on.

390
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:25,370
Did you notice another inconsistency in those who want direct peace, which basically means put pressure on Ukraine to give one-third of their land to Russia?

391
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:32,110
They first insisted that Ukraine simply cannot win a war against Russia.

392
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:36,310
Chomsky, Varoufakis, they were all saying this, let's be realist.

393
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:37,790
Ukraine cannot win.

394
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:43,030
But now, when, at least for a moment, it's not yet over,

395
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:46,190
Ukraine is winning the war,

396
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:58,670
they repeat that it shouldn't be allowed to win or even to gain too much because this may provoke Putin's ire and he may press the button.

397
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:03,730
Now, what is the truth behind it?

398
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:10,650
Recall how in the first days of the war, Western powers offered Zelensky, Ukrainian president,

399
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:27,290
you remember, just two, three days into it, they offered him a special plane to take him out of Kiev, implying that the situation is already lost, so let's get over it fast.

400
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:34,750
This hysterical precipitous offer made palpable the true desire of the West,

401
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:42,010
a desire which was spoiled by the unexpected Ukrainian resistance.

402
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:48,310
That's for me the truth.

403
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:49,990
I wonder if you agree with it.

404
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:57,690
And I have many friends that, we in the West, all my political friends in Slovenia, in France,

405
00:48:57,714 --> 00:49:07,114
I could feel the secret pleasure when, you know, in the first day there were already Russian commandos dropped onto Kiev.

406
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:13,210
They thought, okay, okay, it will be soon over, then we will protest, but it will be over.

407
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:23,970
The true best surprise was Ukrainians really, they tell you this privately, not publicly, Ukrainians screwed up everything by their resistance.

408
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:30,830
Couldn't they just swallow it and sacrifice themselves for our Western welfare and so on?

409
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:42,590
So now our obsession is let's make peace, but peace in such a way that Russia should be allowed to save face.

410
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:44,710
What does this mean?

411
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:54,550
Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who now serves as deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council

412
00:49:54,574 --> 00:50:13,574
recently said that the US-led NATO military alliance would be too scared of a nuclear apocalypse to directly enter the conflict in response to Russia using tactical nuclear weapons.

413
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:19,290
I believe that NATO will not directly intervene in the conflict even in this situation.

414
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:30,850
After all, the security of Washington, London, Brussels is much more important for the North Atlantic alliance than the fate of a dying Ukraine that no one needs.

415
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:36,370
The supply of modern weapons is just a business for Western countries.

416
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:48,450
Overseas and European demagogues are not going to perish in a nuclear apocalypse, therefore Therefore, they will swallow the use of any weapon in the current conflict.

417
00:50:49,290 --> 00:51:00,630
You see, that's why for me this idea, let's allow Putin to save his face, doesn't work.

418
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:12,510
Because what Medvedev says here is exact what amounts to preventing the West to save its face.

419
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:21,330
Medvedev in advance interprets every compromise as the West will lose its face, they are afraid,

420
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:28,750
they don't want to perish in a nuclear war and so on and so on.

421
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:44,730
Also, as for the background of the war, and I'm talking now as a Leninist communist my Here you get, please listen carefully and then we will slowly come to the end, Putin.

422
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:55,070
Putin, it's incredible, people forgot this what Putin said on 21st of February, two days before the attack.

423
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:01,130
I found these lines shocking.

424
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:06,070
I don't get it how some leftists claim NATO imperialism and so

425
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:16,230
Putin openly declares himself conservative with a goal to destroy European unity.

426
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:25,870
He's systematically supporting all extreme right-wing in Europe, Le Pen in France, Salvini in Italy, and so on and so on.

427
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:32,670
And the big bad guy for him is Lenin.

428
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:35,490
And it's true, look at the history.

429
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:48,450
The 20s, okay, there was a civil war, blah, blah, but in 22 or when the civil war was over, it was a golden era for Ukraine.

430
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:55,350
Under Tsarist Russia, Ukrainian language was not recognized and so on and so on.

431
00:52:55,350 --> 00:53:05,070
In the 20s, Ukraine was admitted as a full nation with all the cultural apparatus.

432
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:09,490
It was an extraordinary time, especially in Ukraine.

433
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:15,870
Like, do you know that for some time, there were its incredible story, just the visual arts.

434
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:26,570
At some college in Ukraine, College of Visual Arts, At the same time, Malevich and Chagall were teaching.

435
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,210
They couldn't stand each other and so on.

436
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,690
It was a golden era.

437
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:35,670
Then, with Stalin, the line changed, which is why today in Russia,

438
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:40,550
Lenin is out, Stalin is half in.

439
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:51,050
And also, this idea of, this is the most dangerous line of argumentation, I don't know if you have it here, this idea of Euro-Asianism.

440
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:53,410
My God, do people know history?

441
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,390
At the origin, this is a fascist idea.

442
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:03,690
Do you know that already in the early 20s, among Russian immigration, anti-communist immigration,

443
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:12,310
came this idea that, for example, the main person here is Ivan Ilyin,

444
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:16,810
who is now quasi-official philosopher.

445
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:23,810
His body was transported from France, brought to Russia, buried with all state owners, and so on and so on.

446
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:27,010
His idea was that fascism was good.

447
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:31,170
He supported to the end Mussolini, Hitler, the West, and Hitler.

448
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:41,430
But that their fascism was too much under the influence of Western mechanical society to industrial.

449
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:49,370
And that the only true fascism would have been the Russian fascism as the right balance

450
00:54:49,394 --> 00:55:01,594
between Western individualism and aging this global immersion of the individual into a crowd and so on and so on.

451
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:04,010
Here I am.

452
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:08,590
Now I come to my conclusion.

453
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:15,130
What interests me, and this is the real danger that I see,

454
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:32,110
is that this Putin's line of criticizing the West as decadent, orgy, and so on, gay rights, LGBT plus, is more and more

455
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:37,190
in consonance with American new right.

456
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:45,150
My, I use this term with full irony, friend Jordan Peterson from the debate.

457
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:47,110
I was shocked.

458
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:49,290
I didn't know he will do this.

459
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:55,830
You know that he adopted now pro-Russian position.

460
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:05,070
But I think in some sense he is right, not in the sense that I agree with him.

461
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:19,090
But I think that Americans knew religious conservatism and what Putin is doing are gradually getting coordinated.

462
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:27,370
The Republican Party lawmakers who oppose support for Ukraine are getting stronger and stronger.

463
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:37,110
They do not want to send money abroad when it can be used in the U.S. to fortify the southern border and so on.

464
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:51,370
For example, Trump-backed candidate P.D. Vance criticized Ukraine as a corrupt nation run by oligarchs, and while he formally condemned Russia's invasion,

465
00:56:51,394 --> 00:57:04,694
he also called it insulting and strategically stupid to devote billions of resources to Ukraine while ignoring the problems in our own countries.

466
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:12,690
So, a Russian attack on Ukraine and the alt-right revolt in the US are two aspects of the same global movement.

467
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:31,570
If the Western Christian revolt and the Russian anti-European stance will unite into one, This will be a global sociopolitical catastrophe of immeasurable amplitude.

468
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:47,950
For the US and Russia, Russian neoconservatives, Europe is caught in the vortex of self-destructive the generation, LGBT+, gay marriages, no clear distinction of sexes.

469
00:57:51,110 --> 00:58:03,790
So one cannot but note the obvious imminent inconsistency of the neo-conservatives from the Russian ones to American alt-right

470
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:16,214
while they pretend to deplore the multicultural hedonism, and present themselves as the embodiment of traditional Christian values,

471
00:58:16,238 --> 00:58:23,438
their works and acts display extraordinary vulgarity, sexism and racism.

472
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:25,790
Let me just conclude with one case.

473
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:30,230
You remember, it occurred back in 2012.

474
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:41,050
In an effort to explain his stance on abortion, Rep. Todd Akin, the Republican Senate nominee from Missouri,

475
00:58:41,074 --> 00:58:56,774
provoked Ayer across the political spectrum by saying that in instances of what he called legitimate rape, women's bodies somehow block an unwanted pregnancy.

476
00:58:56,790 --> 00:59:14,170
Responding to this theory, Akin claimed that he has misspoken, he really wanted to say that there are legitimate cases of rape where penetration is really enforced.

477
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:23,530
But that if the victim shows signs of consent, say getting wet and excited, this then is no longer a legitimate case of rape.

478
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:27,670
I think this confusion reveals the truth.

479
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:35,330
What Akin really wanted to say is precisely what his misspoken formulation says.

480
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:46,670
In some cases, rape is legitimate since the victim showed signs of participation, which means it really wasn't rape.

481
00:59:46,670 --> 01:00:03,150
Leaving behind the obvious falsity and vulgarities of Aikin's reasoning, I want to draw the parallel with the Russian attack on Ukraine since the matter of rape was also evoked from the Russian side.

482
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:13,650
At a press conference on February 7th, Putin noted that the Ukrainian government does not like the means agreement and then add it.

483
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:16,970
Like it or not, it's your duty, my beauty.

484
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:21,530
The saying has well-known sexual connotations.

485
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:27,310
Putin quoted, was quoting from Sleeping Beauty in a Coffin,

486
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:33,970
sung by a Soviet era punk group, Red Mold, where you have the lines,

487
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:41,310
sleeping beauty in a coffin, I crept up and fucked her, like it or dislike it, sleep my beauty.

488
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:44,470
So there is a clear reference to rape here.

489
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:48,410
There are cases when the rape of a country is legitimate,

490
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:50,590
that is to say, justified.

491
01:00:50,990 --> 01:01:01,530
My point is that such male chauvinist obscenities are the not even so hidden truth of the proponents of traditional Christian values.

492
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:03,810
So again, to really conclude,

493
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:07,410
we should accept Peterson's basic premise.

494
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:16,070
Russian attack on Ukraine and the alt-right revolt in the US are two aspects of the same global movement.

495
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:24,870
But does this mean that in contrast to him, to Peterson, we should support the opposite side?

496
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:27,550
Here things get complicated.

497
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:38,450
It is true that if the Western Christian revolt and the Russian anti-European stance will unite into one, this will be a global catastrophe.

498
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:45,730
However, we are still dealing with an antagonism internal to global capitalism.

499
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:51,990
What Peterson attacks is the ultimate consequence of global capitalism itself.

500
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:57,910
We all know the most famous line from Marxist communist manifesto.

501
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:07,010
The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations.

502
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:20,750
All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at least compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life."

503
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:35,490
I think that what is still ignored, this is still ignored by those leftist cultural theorists who focus their critique on patriarchal ideology and practice.

504
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:47,770
Is it not time to start to wonder about the fact that the critique of patriarchy was elevated into the main target at the very historical moment,

505
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:54,270
ours when patriarchy definitely lost its hegemonic role?

506
01:02:56,910 --> 01:03:04,790
What becomes of patriarchal family values when a child can sue his parents for neglect and abuse?

507
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:16,710
When family and parenthood are reduced to temporally dissolvable contract between independent individuals.

508
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:31,670
So the culture war raging in the developed west now, in the States, in Europe, is I think a false war, a war between two versions of the same global capitalist system.

509
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:40,830
It unrestrained pure version, which is this insistence on infinite dynamics, plasticity,

510
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:55,330
LGBT, reinvent your identity all the time, and it's neo-fascist conservative version, which tries to unite capitalist dynamism with more traditional values.

511
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:57,770
The paradox is here double.

512
01:03:58,390 --> 01:04:03,610
The Western political correctness is a displacement of the good old class struggle.

513
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:18,130
The liberal elite pretends to protect the threatened racial and sexual minorities in order to obfuscate the basic fact of their privileged economic and power position.

514
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:30,950
And this lie allows the alt-right populists to present themselves as a defense of the real working class against the big corporations and the deep state elites.

515
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:42,230
The paradox is thus that today's populist conservatives are more revolutionary than and the politically correct liberals

516
01:04:42,254 --> 01:04:49,454
who are not afraid to call for social order and even police oppression when they feel this is needed.

517
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:58,170
We often hear the complaint, where were the police and National Guard on January 6, 2021.

518
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:14,630
The implication to be drawn is not just that left and right are today outdated notions, But that both poles of today's Cold War can only be properly grasped as a displaced class struggle.

519
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:21,170
Neither of them really stands for those exploited.

520
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:25,070
And again, this is our tragic predicament today.

521
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:33,750
You remember, I was, of course, my eyes were glued to the screen on January 6th of the previous year.

522
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:36,450
You remember the crowd invading capital.

523
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:47,390
But what shocked me so much is how many of my leftist friends in the United States and in Europe were crying.

524
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:50,850
They said, what is going on?

525
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:53,230
We the people should be doing this.

526
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:57,850
It's beautiful to watch it, but the wrong guys are doing it.

527
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:03,150
That's our predicament today.

528
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:15,890
I think what, again, I listen, I even sometimes listen to Steve Bannon's podcasts or whatever.

529
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:21,830
And did you notice how he's doing almost the same thing as Putin?

530
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:31,210
He begins like if he has a one-hour podcast talk with the first 20 minutes, I almost fully agree.

531
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:37,290
He describes how the big corporations stayed, employs ordinary blah blah blah, all that.

532
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:41,370
Then, of course, things take a strange turn.

533
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:54,310
It's the same I heard from my friends in Moscow who are like with one leg in prison already but with the other leg still running around, that Putin is doing the same.

534
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:58,910
He doesn't have only Dugin and this religious orthodox maniac.

535
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:11,870
Putin also mobilized a group of young Marxists who are providing him a more leftist Third World line.

536
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:21,490
They provided him with this line, Russia is really defending the world from Western imperialist colonization.

537
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:28,350
We are on the side of all those exploited in the Third World and so on and so on.

538
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:37,210
And I hope you are aware of this situation, how incredibly successful this Russian propaganda is

539
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:48,870
not in the West, but in Latin America, in many parts of Asia, Africa, and so on and so on.

540
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:59,250
So, I think that maybe this is the crucial dilemma today.

541
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:13,310
Our situation today is the one of crisis of a system itself.

542
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:31,510
What conservatives got right is that this Fukuyama ideal of liberal democratic capitalism is in full crisis, in the sense of, you know what is for me the most ominous case?

543
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:45,830
In England, in France, in United States, you have now protests which are no longer like in some parts of Eastern Europe, protests for true democracy.

544
01:08:45,854 --> 01:09:07,154
No, they they articulate a doubt in our version of liberal democracy itself. And the tragedy is that there is no way to to give to articulate in organized political way this rage.

545
01:09:07,178 --> 01:09:15,678
And with this I want to To conclude, we are back at the beginning of European history.

546
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:26,450
My friend, although a right-winger, he is not stupid, Peter Sloterdijk, wrote a wonderful book, Being and Rage, Sein und Zorren,

547
01:09:26,474 --> 01:09:39,274
of course an ironic paraphrase of Heidegger's Being in Time, where he said, what's at the beginning, at least in our mythic view of the western culture, it's Homer Iliad.

548
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:55,050
And what is the first line of Iliad, a call to the dead goddess, whatever, to allow him to do a poem on the rage of Achilles, which brought blah, blah, blah.

549
01:09:55,410 --> 01:10:00,670
Today we have even a much more dangerous rage, dissatisfaction.

550
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:07,770
action, and what's really tragic is that the left is losing it.

551
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:21,410
I think that – I agree here with the guy whom I criticised briefly, Varoufakis – I think that capitalism is changing already into something different.

552
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:32,150
And either we will invent – I don't like to use the word communism, it's too crazy but a really new social order to deal with the ongoing problems,

553
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:40,110
or a new form of fascism, sorry, of neo-federalism, let's call it, will take over.

554
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:48,790
So, you know, what, again, what I would be really my nightmare is and Trump is already sending signals and so on,

555
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:55,630
even Bolsonaro is more friendly towards Putin and so on.

556
01:10:55,630 --> 01:11:08,910
This pact between European and whatever new populist conservatives and Russia and so on,

557
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,930
that's the danger.

558
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:20,630
And I don't think we are taking seriously this danger because we too much still believe in liberal democracy.

559
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:22,890
I appreciate liberal democracy.

560
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:26,590
It's a wonderful thing, but today it's a crisis.

561
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:36,110
Because the only way to confront all the problems we have today is to make a step beyond.

562
01:11:36,970 --> 01:11:40,310
And that's the reason of my pessimism.

563
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:41,070
You know why?

564
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:56,410
To conclude, I don't, you know, in good old Marxist, all liberal times, we still could rely on historical faith necessity, like this Marxist faith of history is moving towards progress and so on.

565
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:56,790
No.

566
01:11:57,210 --> 01:12:00,570
Now we have to act against history.

567
01:12:01,030 --> 01:12:04,390
Historical tendency is towards catastrophe.

568
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:07,550
What will happen, I don't know.

569
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:14,450
But I prefer to be a pessimist in order to awaken us.

570
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:16,010
Sorry if I was too long.

571
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:34,910
So stop, please, we don't have time for this.

572
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:39,390
I said some things which may be very problematic for you.

573
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:45,830
First about, I'm not bluffing, you know, I'm not reading a proper Russian propaganda.

574
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:54,410
For very conformist reasons, this will I hope amuse you, which shows the depth of my depravity.

575
01:12:54,410 --> 01:13:05,930
When I was in high school in mid-60s in Slovenia, English was obligatory, first, second language,

576
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:08,170
and then we had the choice of another.

577
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:11,310
It was either French or German or Russian.

578
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:16,510
I've chosen Russian for disgusting reasons.

579
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:23,170
My idea was, it's a cold war, one side will win, I want to be sure to speak the language of the winner.

580
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:32,870
But now it comes good because you know I am not, I am not just reading about it.

581
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:35,870
I listen all the time to Russian media

582
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:39,810
and it's even more horrible than this report.

583
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:41,990
And the second thing with this I really conclude,

584
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:53,790
some pragmatic friends of mine are telling me but don't take all this stuff about Russian mission, holy war, Don't take it seriously, these are just words.

585
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:57,930
What they really want is just a small part of Ukraine.

586
01:13:58,630 --> 01:13:58,670
No.

587
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:06,210
Words, if we have something to learn, is that words are not, never only words.

588
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:13,190
Take the case, I'm not comparing nonetheless Putin with Hitler, but take the case of Germany.

589
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:28,494
Do you know that when Hitler took power in 1933, this was the predominant attitude and Fortunately, among the Jews there, he just needs this rhetoric to take power once he will establish make a deal with him.

590
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:31,290
No. Words matter.

591
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:38,150
So I don't believe in this Putin is just saying this or his ideologies in reality.

592
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:42,270
No. Wars are never simply pragmatic.

593
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:49,370
You always, how should I put it, get caught into your own words.

594
01:14:49,370 --> 01:15:00,630
So, please counter-attack, I would like to hear your counter-opinion, or I hope I made my position clear about LGBT plus and so on, all that.

595
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:04,450
I totally support them.

596
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:09,670
In my country, I also here and there fight for them, with them, and so on.

597
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:16,010
I'm just saying that the ideology, which not always,

598
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:32,990
but sometimes accompanies LGBT plus, this simple reliance of the choice of our sex is our free decision and then this game of plasticity, you know, in the sense of,

599
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:53,930
oh that's the true freedom. Today I'm gay, tomorrow I'm hetero, next day I'm bisexual, This is so discriminatory and humiliating for LGBT people themselves.

600
01:15:54,470 --> 01:16:06,010
You know how traumatic, for example, I know an example, there was a movie made in Belgium where a boy wanted to become a lady.

601
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:15,610
And it was so traumatic for him, although he or she had the support from parents, everybody was good and so on.

602
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:20,950
And of course, in some sense, it's a choice.

603
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:23,690
It's not biologically determined.

604
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:31,210
But it's not a simple conscious choice in the sense of oh, that's how I feel now and so on and so on.

605
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:35,510
You know that if you are a trans, if you do the operation,

606
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:38,790
you know how painful are these operations?

607
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:39,910
This is traumatic.

608
01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:45,910
This means you feel the urge to do it.

609
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:56,530
Which means of course it's your choice, but not a simple choice in the sense, oh my God, look, I like boys, I like girls, I like trans people, let's play all of them.

610
01:16:56,530 --> 01:17:00,770
And you are ready to stake your survival on it.

611
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:03,350
So that's what I'm pleading here for.

612
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:13,130
It's not biology, but it's also not this superficial how I feel I declare and so on and so on.

613
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:26,950
Do you know that yes, LGBT plus people are free, but they are maybe the most free people among us and they pay the price for it.

614
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:36,670
You know that here I accept this paradox of true freedom is not this superficial freedom of choice.

615
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:42,450
Like let's go to a patisserie, should be cheesecake or chocolate cake or strawberry cake.

616
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:48,590
True freedom is experienced usually even as necessity.

617
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:54,430
Like, imagine LGBT plus boy, at least biologic looks, no.

618
01:17:55,110 --> 01:18:07,270
He experiences deep his identity as either third one or woman or whatever, something third, and in some sense, he has no choice.

619
01:18:07,870 --> 01:18:12,370
But again, this is true freedom.

620
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:13,570
It's like love.

621
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:15,350
I always like this example.

622
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:18,270
Love has to be free.

623
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:21,270
I cannot order you to fall in love.

624
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:29,490
But isn't it that love is freedom experienced as the utter necessity?

625
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:40,870
Like when you are truly in love, you cannot say, oh, this person whom I love is too difficult, confused, let me choose another object.

626
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,470
No, you cannot go out.

627
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:43,830
Love is your fate.

628
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:46,370
And precisely as such, it is free.

629
01:18:46,910 --> 01:18:55,190
So, as somebody trained in psychoanalysis, theoretically only, you know, no, I would never do practice.

630
01:18:55,730 --> 01:19:01,530
Some students years ago wanted me to be their psychoanalyst.

631
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:03,050
And you know what was my reaction?

632
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:08,730
I told them, if you want me to be your analyst, then you are really crazy and you need one.

633
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:27,250
But what I'm saying is that, you know, Freudian psychoanalysis gives the thick background of all the traumatic dimension of the topic done by LGBT+.

634
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:40,350
But again, I don't like this idea which sometimes you can feel it that basically sexuality is three in this superficial sense,

635
01:19:40,374 --> 01:19:49,874
you flirt with this, with that option, and then the evil patriarchy comes and tells you no binary, this, that, and so on and so on.

636
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:51,710
No, Freud was right.

637
01:19:51,930 --> 01:20:10,310
We are extraordinary, complex, divided persons, and the great lesson of Jacques Lacan is that There is always a minimal gap between what you want and what you really desire.

638
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:21,190
It's quite often that what you declare that you want is part of a struggle against what unconsciously you desire.

639
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:34,250
And I think out of my respect for LGBT plus and so on, people, to conclude, yes, maybe Then I will really stop if you are stupid enough to believe, but I will.

640
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:45,310
You know what attracts me, and I was so proud when LGBT plus many people, okay now it's more complex, it's LGBTQ whatever and so on.

641
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:52,750
You know what's my basic idea in this agreement with some strength.

642
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:58,350
How do you, maybe if you read some of my books you must know this line, how do you define

643
01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:08,630
Either in an empirical way, which is, maybe there are other identities that the list is never complete.

644
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:19,270
So plus stands for, let's see, if you say, I'm neither L, not G, B, blah, blah, the space is open for you.

645
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:22,310
But I propose a much more radical reading.

646
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:30,510
As subject, we are basically this plus itself, escaping every identification.

647
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:38,810
That's why, I'm sorry, I didn't go more into philosophy, that's why modern subjectivity is more feminine.

648
01:21:39,370 --> 01:21:42,850
And that's the great thing about psychoanalysis, what I mean by this.

649
01:21:43,390 --> 01:21:54,230
You know, hysteria for Freud, and Lacan points this out, It's the basic form of critique of ideology in practice.

650
01:21:54,530 --> 01:21:58,090
Why? Because, as Lacombe points out in a wonderful way,

651
01:21:58,970 --> 01:22:05,470
the basic mechanism of ideology is ideological symbolic identification.

652
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:11,610
The existing order tells you, gives you a space of what you are.

653
01:22:11,950 --> 01:22:16,210
You are a man, a professor, or whatever.

654
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:21,610
But the original hysterical question is,

655
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:27,110
why am I what you are saying that I am?

656
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:34,550
The doubt into your symbolic identity provided by society.

657
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:44,250
That's the, this is why in contrast to those who think that the Cartesian cogito, this pure modern subject is masculine.

658
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:50,770
No, it's feminine, and we don't have time to go into this, but this is a wonderful topic.

659
01:22:51,290 --> 01:23:02,590
You know that that's why already in his age, early 17th century, Descartes was extremely popular among women who immediately got this.

660
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:07,070
Cogito, aha, it's not men, there is a space for us.

661
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:13,990
And women, not just Queen Christina of the stupid movie with Greta Garbo of Sweden.

662
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:20,510
But it was extraordinary what movement among women was triggered.

663
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:32,210
And all this is so important today if we live also psychologically in an era of paradoxes, my God.

664
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:42,810
It's permissiveness which is turning around into strict regulation with all the politically correct rules and so on and so on.

665
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:58,710
With all this focus on, again, permissiveness and pleasure, what we get is more than ever impotence, frigidity and so on and so on.

666
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:01,110
Sex is a big mess.

667
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:03,210
We have to accept this.

668
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:05,950
In itself, it's a big mess.

669
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:12,970
And here, although at other points I disagree with her, here I agree with Judith Butler

670
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:23,310
where she pointed out how the basic, this would be the minimum of what you mentioned, this surplus enjoyment as opposed to pleasure.

671
01:24:24,030 --> 01:24:29,650
You know that sexuality always gets entangled in these paradoxes.

672
01:24:29,650 --> 01:24:39,870
Your desire is repressed, but then it turns around into desire for repression itself.

673
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:49,570
The very mode you try to repress your desire turns into an additional source of enjoyment and so on and so on.

674
01:24:50,650 --> 01:25:15,750
And I think here, precisely in today's mess of sexual identities, psychoanalysis is needed more than ever now it's really time for me to stop my favorite it's diet coke

675
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:35,640
with cherry taste because this cherry, this is a nice example of this rigid designator it's you recognize it's totally chemical I don't see any link between how real Clarice tastes and that's why I like it.

676
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,680
Okay. Thank you, Slav.

677
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:41,440
We've got time.

678
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:48,320
I mean, we have to be done by nine because we're both guessing on Steve Bannon's podcast.

679
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:50,520
That's a joke.

680
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:58,680
Yeah, we have, you know, 20, 25 minutes for question and answer.

681
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:02,900
There are microphones up front, or why don't we use this center one?

682
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:07,460
So, if you have a question, why don't we line up at the microphone and.

683
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:10,340
Yeah, but didn't you tell me there are more microphones?

684
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:13,240
There's one over there too, but let's, in the interest of getting it.

685
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:13,680
Okay.

686
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:16,560
Yeah, you, yeah.

687
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:21,580
Wait, so.

688
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:23,500
Yeah, okay.

689
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:30,760
Okay. Is the mic working?

690
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:34,380
Testing, testing, one, two, three.

691
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:35,360
Can you hear me?

692
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:39,020
Okay.

693
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:50,320
Please. So I guess I noticed although I'm often proclaimed anti-feminist, but it makes me very sad.

694
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:53,720
Is there any woman in the line?

695
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,760
No, you know why I'm saying this seriously?

696
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:09,300
Because, for example, I'm very good friend with many black people and we have this type of wonderful relationship where,

697
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:18,660
I don't dare to give you examples, all the time we exchange dirty racist innuendos, jokes and so on.

698
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:21,960
And we love each other for that, you know.

699
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:27,420
And so once I was with a black friend of mine, I was tired. I was just polite.

700
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:29,040
And he was in a panic.

701
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,180
He told me, are you mad at me or what?

702
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,060
Where are your dirty jokes?

703
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:43,560
So what I'm saying is that nonetheless, a proof that I am a feminist, it's a purely theoretical one.

704
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:49,500
I am a Hegelian, and in the last 20, 30 years, practically,

705
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:53,180
all good books on Hegel are written by women.

706
01:27:54,240 --> 01:28:01,000
Rebecca Comay, even Judith Butler, something about desire, her first book, very good one, is on Hegel.

707
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:03,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

708
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:06,080
So, I'm sorry, I'm again getting lost, please.

709
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:09,160
Testing one, two, three.

710
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:10,780
All right.

711
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:13,020
Yeah, but do you in.

712
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:15,660
Testing one, two, three.

713
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:17,240
Do you hear him?

714
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:18,820
Okay, okay.

715
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:26,360
So I guess my question would be, so for a little context,

716
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:38,700
in say medieval society you sort of had, you would have, you would have the concept of the carnival was a very common sort of thing.

717
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:44,100
Yes, and then you had a sort of similar things in similar societies like in ancient Rome.

718
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:53,740
I think I've heard the anecdote of how they'd have a festival or something where they'd make the slave the emperor, the king for Dan and at the end of the day they'd kill him.

719
01:28:54,240 --> 01:29:05,960
So you sort of had this sort of publicization and sort of social acceptance of this sort of bizarre, irrational, into the sort of form of public release.

720
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:20,100
Do you think that the sort, do you think that a sort of modern sort of sense of trying, sort of like 15th, 16th, 17th century, trying to cut, trying to lift the average person outside

721
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:37,424
of that carnival, do you think that the sort of 20th and 21st century as sort of seeing the sort of carnival and sort of this very sort of strict regime that you might see spoken about when someone like Foucault,

722
01:29:37,424 --> 01:29:50,100
do you think that the 20th and 21st centuries are sort of that the carnival and this sort of order that we tried to create without it are sort of converged and merged?

723
01:29:50,100 --> 01:30:06,220
Do you think that the sort of shame that is sort of being seen on the public level is at the very consequences of those merging?

724
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:10,040
It's a very precise question.

725
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:18,740
I'm still in some sense, sorry if I disappoint you here, attached to modernity.

726
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:24,700
I still think maybe not early modernity, but French Revolution is a mega event for me and so on.

727
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:37,100
So my point would be that already what happened in the 20th century was a kind of dark underside of carnival.

728
01:30:37,460 --> 01:30:52,020
Do you know probably, did you read the book, it's a classic on carnival among others by Michael Bakhtin on Francois Rablé, he elaborated this notion of carnival.

729
01:30:52,880 --> 01:31:02,580
But my friend, the German art theorist, Boris Groys, recently got hold of archives of Bakhtin.

730
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:11,140
He survived the purges because he moved to Kazan, some smaller city, and the big Moscow bureaucracy forgot about him.

731
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:30,280
And what's so fascinating is that, it was a unanimous message from his private notes that for him, the big carnival that he didn't dare to mention where the Stalinist purpose.

732
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:37,980
Because it was, you know, today you are a king, member of Politburo, tomorrow you are an English spy, a British spy.

733
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:45,480
It was, and even in, there is also a carnival aspect.

734
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:50,080
Some friends of mine, black people are exploring it.

735
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:58,300
Ku Klux Klan in its, sorry for this horrible term, I mean it ironically, golden era in 1920s.

736
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:02,780
You know, it was the end of the week carnival for the white people.

737
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,060
Let's have some fun.

738
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,280
Let's lynch some black guys.

739
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:10,700
let's rape some black women and so on and so on.

740
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:31,540
So I think that I always found it problematic to oppose this rigid order of a society and this moment of freedom where the king is a servant, the servant is a king, all that stuff.

741
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:48,500
I think that in most of the time, carnivals were simply a kind of a libidical supplement in an intermediate way, even supporting the existing order which you should not forget this.

742
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:51,500
Don't idealize medieval times.

743
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:54,720
There are many things we don't know.

744
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:59,620
I mean, we don't know, but how brutal oppression was there?

745
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:07,420
I mean, you know, sometimes we idealize them as a kind of a small organic community, extremely brutal times.

746
01:33:07,820 --> 01:33:22,880
So what I am, of course, there are attempts to see even in mass sport events and so on, new forms of cardio, but for me, again,

747
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:28,260
the least I would say is that there is also a very dark side

748
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:39,980
For example, in Nazi literature, when, no, it's too crazy to say that's too horrible, that Auschwitz was a carnival.

749
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:47,220
But the way Kristallnacht, you know when 38, when Jews were beaten,

750
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:52,660
some of them lynched and so on, has a clear structure of a carnival.

751
01:33:53,660 --> 01:34:01,400
It even up to a point, as is typical for a carnival, run out of control, and that's the very sad thing.

752
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:05,720
It wasn't that it was planned by Goebbels or whom.

753
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:11,640
It was, but even they were surprised by how it exploded.

754
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:19,300
So again, I'm just saying don't also don't idealize the carnival.

755
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:34,460
The carnival is for me quite often that, or another element, it's not the same as carnival, I know, but one of the nicest memories from communism that I have is, I didn't like it,

756
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:44,200
but how it's not carnival, but the role played there by political jokes, jokes against those in power.

757
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:59,840
I always had a suspicion, although some people were arrested for telling them, that those in power were fully aware that it has this carnivalesque notion of,

758
01:34:59,864 --> 01:35:07,964
if you don't allow people to let their steam off, how do you call it, through telling jokes, then you will have real protests.

759
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:27,200
So it's not true, but there is a rumor. It's not true, but it's the right insight that secret police departments, police in Eastern Europe, communist times, had secret departments fabricating jokes.

760
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:33,880
Not jokes against the Western decadence, but jokes against their own police.

761
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:42,860
The idea was allow, give these people a way to express their anger to, you know, and so on and so on.

762
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:51,260
And again, with Stalinism, it's absolutely clear this functioning,

763
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:53,540
this carnivalesque dimension,

764
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:57,840
especially when the purgaries got serious.

765
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:02,200
The true Stalinist purgaries were 34, 36.

766
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:06,260
And it's pure carnival in what sense?

767
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:15,940
Do you know that, for example, in those two years, like 70% of the central committee members were liquidated,

768
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:24,200
more than half of the headquarters of the army top generals were liquidated. Situation was the worst.

769
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:28,840
It's very interesting to know this in Ukraine, where that's what I call a perk.

770
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:37,840
In 1934, Ukrainian Central Committee had 200 members, the central committee of the party.

771
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:44,700
You know how many of them were alive three years later, no two years later, three.

772
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:47,820
That's what I call a perch.

773
01:36:49,200 --> 01:37:06,780
So again, I didn't answer all the depth of your question I know, I'm just saying that Bakhtin himself is misread when he's presented as the guy who somehow just celebrated carnival.

774
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:13,200
No, he was well aware of the dark aspects of a carnival of this other side.

775
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:22,320
Otherwise, I am an idiot, but not complete idiot, which means that I am well aware of the finesse of your question, the other aspects.

776
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:35,880
But now I will just limit myself to this general point, don't overestimate some kind of a, non-emancipatory power of carnival.

777
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:41,160
And this is why my, this is why I'm also not so fascinated,

778
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:44,100
you know, we had not so much here but in Europe,

779
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:51,340
you know this big populist movement like a couple of years ago in Istanbul.

780
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:57,500
One million people protesting against Erdogan or in Egypt and so on.

781
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:04,020
I always have a deep mistrust against this big million people there.

782
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:09,720
What interests me is how to say after you get drunk, the morning after, no?

783
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:16,820
How this energy unleashed is then translated into a new order.

784
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:21,600
Usually, carnivals don't produce a new order.

785
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:24,180
They are just a momentary explosion,

786
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:29,960
and then things return to the old order.

787
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:32,120
And that's what I don't like.

788
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:38,740
I think that the really difficult thing is not to organize one million people shouting there.

789
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:48,340
No, but to make a change felt when things return to normal, to establish a new normal.

790
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:55,360
That's why years ago, you remember the movie, how is that, oh my God, the movie about.

791
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:56,520
Sorry?

792
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:10,060
Yeah. My big point, I repeated it many times in my books, is I would kill my mother, sold her into slavery to see, I'm sorry,

793
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:11,700
Vendetta Part II.

794
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:13,280
Did you see the movie?

795
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:18,880
At the end, triumph, people break the police code, they won.

796
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,240
Okay, but what happened then?

797
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:23,780
How is the new power structured?

798
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:26,860
That's the big problem today.

799
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:30,280
Okay, let's see if we can get a couple more.

800
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:31,680
I'm sorry, I will be much faster.

801
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:32,160
I understand.

802
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,320
Thank you, sir.

803
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:36,380
I mean, I will have to give you a quicker answer.

804
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:37,720
Sorry. Yeah, please.

805
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:40,820
Howdy. I've got more sort of foreign policy question.

806
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:53,760
And so for me, when you were talking about Russia and Ukraine, it didn't feel to me as though you really adequately addressed the consequences of a more confrontational policy against Russia,

807
01:39:53,784 --> 01:40:00,284
which, as you said, words are not just words, should always be taken seriously, especially in Putin's case.

808
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:07,400
And he has, and his government has brought up nuclear war, mutually assured destruction on many occasions now.

809
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:16,980
And I was just wondering how in your mind is it considered moral or could it be considered moral to advocate for a confrontational stance against Russia

810
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:20,700
when the possible consequences of such a stance are so?

811
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:23,860
Please just repeat the last word.

812
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:33,300
How could it be considered moral to adopt a confrontational stance against Russia when the possible consequences of adopting that stance are so high,

813
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:36,200
you know, i.e. mutually assured destruction?

814
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:44,960
But I totally agree with this.

815
01:40:45,520 --> 01:41:02,100
But why do you think that, isn't it that the way I see it, that Russia started the topic of using tactical nuclear weapons and all that stuff and so on and so on?

816
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:10,940
And I think, first I don't believe that Putin is a madman and so on, who just waits to press the button.

817
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:14,920
I think he's precisely playing on this fear.

818
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:18,900
My God, what if I go crazy and so on and so on.

819
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:21,940
So you know what's my problem?

820
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:32,320
Many of my friends by this line whenever NATO does something it must be bad or whatever.

821
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:37,760
But my problem here is, okay, I tell you this.

822
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:43,160
We can talk for hours because I'm also very critical of Ukrainians.

823
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:53,460
First, the mistakes, and it's two weak words, mistakes they made, point to this is the darkest part, how?

824
01:41:53,920 --> 01:42:07,280
Even now, the West is already, everything is set in motion to prepare whatever you call it, I hate these words, neoliberal colonization from the West of Ukraine.

825
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:17,760
Do you know that according to some sources, one-third of best Ukrainian land is already owned by big American agricultural companies and so on.

826
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:25,860
They are putting terrible pressure now already on Ukraine, this open totally to free market, blah, blah, all that.

827
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:30,040
So I'm well aware on this.

828
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:33,180
You know what's the danger I see here?

829
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:41,420
Some of my leftist friends who say, okay, if you attack, if we give arms to Ukraine,

830
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:45,380
it means we support our military industry, blah, blah.

831
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:48,660
I ask them a very simple question.

832
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:52,780
So what should be our message to Ukrainians?

833
01:42:52,780 --> 01:43:01,700
Sometimes what my friends are saying, telling me sounds like,

834
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:15,220
okay the attack is horrible, but on behalf of global peace and so on, Ukrainians should suffer a little bit, make a compromise and so on and so on.

835
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:33,920
You know who went here to the end and it costs me his friendship more or less Yanis Varoufakis, I was shocked when Taliban won in Afghanistan, he posted, tweet, whatever, but his point was,

836
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:37,520
it's a great defeat of American imperialism.

837
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,180
It's a great victory.

838
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:53,060
Then he says, okay, women will suffer, we should help them, but nonetheless, so his message is that we should say to Afghani, we mean, yes, it's horrible, but sorry,

839
01:43:53,420 --> 01:43:59,540
there is a higher interest of defeating American imperialism, blah, blah, blah, just suffer.

840
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:03,200
This is for me the most horrible thing to do.

841
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:15,800
For example, when people also, some of my leftist friends, condemned, sorry, not Norway, Finland and Sweden, their desire to join NATO.

842
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:25,580
Again, my point is, and I know I have high political connections there, they were scared like shit.

843
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:28,700
So what should we tell them?

844
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:36,900
Sorry guys, you are in danger but you know we don't want to support our military industrial complex or what.

845
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:43,520
So I think that this should be an ABC of progressive politics.

846
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:57,320
Never elevate your cause into a big cause for which then you demand subordinated group to sacrifice their interests.

847
01:44:58,420 --> 01:45:03,060
No, no, again, I'm very critical here of Ukrainians.

848
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:10,440
But, okay, I ask you, and sincerely, it's not rhetoric.

849
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:17,840
What, yes, what should the West have done, Western Europe, when Russia attacked Ukraine?

850
01:45:19,180 --> 01:45:32,780
That's a big question, but I just, I don't see how the suffering of Ukrainians can be put, you know, how we can say that it's better to have the whole world suffer than to just have Ukraine suffer.

851
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:34,580
I agree, it's horrible for that to happen.

852
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:38,380
But when you're talking about world war here.

853
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:44,340
Already, in what you said, some factual implications that I find problematic.

854
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:50,540
Why do you think it would have stopped in Ukraine?

855
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:57,560
Well, I'd just like to say also, I'm not talking about what you said with Afghanistan, where it's this conceptual American empire that we're fighting.

856
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:01,720
This is talking about something that could happen to everybody, right?

857
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:07,220
I think that the possibility of nuclear confrontation should be avoided at all costs,

858
01:46:07,244 --> 01:46:17,044
and if that means not necessarily giving Russia part of Ukraine, but that means adopting a more peaceable, you know, stance right to negotiate.

859
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:18,500
I think that that's what has to be done.

860
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:24,460
Why? Okay, I hear your point.

861
01:46:24,580 --> 01:46:34,320
Of course, we are all afraid of not only of nuclear war, but even larger European war and so on and so on.

862
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:49,740
But the problem for me in Ukraine is nonetheless that I see in what Putin is doing.

863
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:51,880
It's not just Ukraine.

864
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:59,560
It's he began in where not Chechnya, then it was Grazia, Georgia, and so on.

865
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:00,740
It goes around.

866
01:47:00,940 --> 01:47:13,320
He openly says the greatest tragedy of the 20th century was the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and he is openly saying defining Russian sphere.

867
01:47:15,140 --> 01:47:25,780
And I think that first we should clarify what Russia is.

868
01:47:25,780 --> 01:47:42,580
where I disagree with some of my leftist friends is that they are so obsessed by NATO and so on that automatically you have to be, if you are opposed to big Western imperialism, you

869
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:48,160
somehow have to be at least partially on the good side.

870
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:50,760
But my point is a very brutal one.

871
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:58,260
I'm not comparing Putin with Hitler, but what would you then say Germany 1939?

872
01:47:59,660 --> 01:48:01,700
Let's give, isn't this the same logic?

873
01:48:02,260 --> 01:48:08,820
Let's give to Hitler Czechoslovakia just to keep peace in Europe.

874
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:09,280
And then.

875
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:15,400
No, because, I mean, Hitler didn't have the capacity to, Hitler didn't have the capacity to level New York with, you know, the push of a button.

876
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:17,520
Yeah, yeah.

877
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:31,060
Okay, I agree, but again, my problem is, so what's your idea?

878
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:36,080
It's just that let's make compromises, compromises to,

879
01:48:36,460 --> 01:48:39,440
I think this doesn't work.

880
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:46,000
It works in the short term maybe, but then it goes on, it goes on, it goes, it goes on.

881
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:52,440
I'm absolutely fanatically to avoid with peace, but okay, let's be concrete.

882
01:48:53,160 --> 01:49:08,500
Now even Putin is giving hints, now maybe that it's more or less a stalemate, kind of in Ukraine, Ukrainians recapture some parts of it.

883
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:14,620
Yes, there are now maybe conditions for some negotiated peace.

884
01:49:14,620 --> 01:49:20,180
But are you aware that these conditions were created by Western help?

885
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:25,620
Without Western help, Ukraine would have collapsed in a week or two.

886
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:37,080
So I think, at least let's admit this, I don't see in the West some mega, in spite of rhetoric occasional, some mega rhetoric.

887
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:44,060
Even, I think, do you remember immediately when Russia announced the attack?

888
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:51,480
You know what was first Biden's, and I'm no sympathizer of Biden's reaction, it was incredible.

889
01:49:52,940 --> 01:50:01,780
When he was asked what will be the countermeasures, Biden said, it depends how radical Russian interventions will be.

890
01:50:01,780 --> 01:50:06,180
If they want just part of the Southeast, it's one thing.

891
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:07,720
If they want all of it.

892
01:50:08,540 --> 01:50:17,680
So it's incredible how Biden showed immediately an openness to compromise and so on and so on.

893
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:28,800
I just don't accept this obsession with Russia has to save its face and so on and so on.

894
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:38,300
But okay, one thing, okay, let's not lose time, but to give you an example where I think Ukraine should be brutally criticized.

895
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:47,700
You know how Ukraine reacted to the fact, do you remember, that this year's Nobel Peace Prize

896
01:50:47,724 --> 01:50:58,824
was given to some Ukrainian charity organization and some Belarusian and some Russian, who are half arrested, they're really fighting for peace in Russia.

897
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:06,700
Ukraine protested, claiming that although they protest the war in Russia, but they didn't really achieve anything,

898
01:51:06,724 --> 01:51:17,324
it's a shame to give peace Nobel Prize to citizens of a state which is now attacking Ukraine, this is sheer madness, I think.

899
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:23,940
Ukrainians here spoke the same language as Putin and his ideologies.

900
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:29,580
They spoke as if it's a conflict, and here I also disagree with Ukraine.

901
01:51:29,780 --> 01:51:34,140
You know, they like to speak about we are defending Europe.

902
01:51:36,140 --> 01:51:39,100
It's like Europe against Russia.

903
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:44,760
They speak almost the same language as Dugin, Putin's ideologies here.

904
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:46,680
No, we should insist on it.

905
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:50,280
This is a struggle inherent to Europe itself.

906
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:57,440
We have our own fascists and so on, neo-fascists, internal to Russia itself and so on and so on.

907
01:51:57,640 --> 01:52:07,340
If we lose this universal approach and go into this water, you know, Ukraine is defending Europe and so on, we are lost.

908
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:08,580
Do I agree with you?

909
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:10,360
Let's end on universalism.

910
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:11,020
Let's end.

911
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:11,280
Okay.

912
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:12,220
I'm sorry.

913
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:12,500
Yes.

914
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:17,540
I know more people have questions.

915
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:18,020
I'm sorry.

916
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:19,800
We're done at 9.

917
01:52:19,860 --> 01:52:20,540
It's already 9.

918
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:23,320
So we're going to have to cut it short.

919
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:24,320
Okay.

920
01:52:24,420 --> 01:52:26,120
I will try to be short.

921
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:26,740
You know what?

922
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:28,460
My bad taste joke here.

923
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:30,280
I will try to give you.

924
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:30,600
Wait.

925
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:32,000
I need that button.

926
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:33,720
You know what I'm tempted to do?

927
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:34,960
It's a bad joke.

928
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:41,880
to give you this so deep Zen Buddhist answers, you know, clap with one hand or whatever.

929
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:45,400
Okay, we have, I will try to be fast.

930
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:50,160
Let me start off by saying, oh, sorry, yeah.

931
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:54,780
Let me start off by saying it's a great honor for me to meet someone of your own on the left.

932
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:55,980
Sorry.

933
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:04,540
Oh, listen, let's, wait, we're going to have to end it and then why don't you come up and we'll talk to him.

934
01:53:04,540 --> 01:53:05,660
I got a brief question, please.

935
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:06,340
Real quick.

936
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:18,140
How do we both show solidarity with people in the third world and the imperial periphery and sort of kind of concentrate our efforts on fighting the surge in fascism at home?

937
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:19,480
Sorry, I didn't get it.

938
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:20,060
Did you get it?

939
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:21,060
Can you say it once more then?

940
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:28,960
Yeah. How do we as Western leftists both show solidarity with people in the third world and, you know, fight imperialism

941
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:32,800
and also combat the growing tide of fascism at home?

942
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:37,580
Like, is there a contradiction between the two or is there not?

943
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:40,380
And if not, which one should we concentrate our efforts on?

944
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:49,140
You know, this is a big problem, but look, it was the same situation

945
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:51,500
at a different level, totally.

946
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:57,720
You know that Germany and Japan were playing already this game.

947
01:53:57,720 --> 01:54:08,700
When Japan occupied in, when, 39, 40, whatever, most of the far east there, they constituted some kind of anti-imperialist league.

948
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:22,600
When Germans bribed some peaceniks in the United States here and some leftists in England claiming we should not fight imperialist wars and so on.

949
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:26,480
This is the, this is the, this is the tragical situation.

950
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:45,080
But nonetheless, even if American intervention in World War II was the intervention of an imperial superpower of each point too, gave an incredible boost to your not only military industry, but to your economy.

951
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:47,180
Look at the history of the United States.

952
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:51,660
The Great Recession crisis was not over in 3940.

953
01:54:51,660 --> 01:54:59,080
It's only during the World War II years that American economy really, really exploded.

954
01:54:59,580 --> 01:55:03,160
But my answer to you would be this one.

955
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:14,960
Yes, all that talk about anti-imperialism, but who are till now these great anti-imperialist friends of Russia?

956
01:55:15,220 --> 01:55:15,940
It is Iran.

957
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:17,420
Sorry.

958
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:22,080
It's tremendously important what is happening there.

959
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:29,900
It's an incredible thing how women are on the top of an authentic revolution.

960
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:31,700
Something broke in Iran.

961
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:35,500
Russia, it's an incredibly important event.

962
01:55:35,980 --> 01:55:38,140
And Russia is on that side.

963
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:41,700
Then North Korea is sending volunteers.

964
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:50,620
than some other similar countries, Taliban of course, Afghanistan and so on.

965
01:55:50,900 --> 01:55:55,420
On the other hand, I'm not such a pessimist.

966
01:55:55,520 --> 01:56:08,940
If you ask me how to fight imperialism, there are many states, even now, where I'm not a total pessimist, where leftists are in power and are doing a relatively good job.

967
01:56:08,940 --> 01:56:15,140
For example, my supreme example, I don't know if you agree, is always because I have friends there.

968
01:56:15,460 --> 01:56:18,480
Linera Morales, Vice President Bolivia.

969
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:23,100
In ten years of Morales' power, they did a true miracle.

970
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:28,360
The standard of living of ordinary people is much higher.

971
01:56:28,740 --> 01:56:40,700
That's why you remember there was a coup d'etat and then in so-called free elections, although controlled by the army, Morales forces came back to power.

972
01:56:40,980 --> 01:56:45,260
It's extraordinary what is happening now in Latin America.

973
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:49,800
Leftism there, it's not just those who screwed it up, like Nicaragua,

974
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:55,440
Venezuela, and Cuba, with all respect for Cuba,

975
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:58,140
but they screwed it up basically, no?

976
01:56:58,540 --> 01:57:02,840
No, it's new countries like, okay, Chile, it's problematic.

977
01:57:02,840 --> 01:57:06,060
They lost the referendum for constitution.

978
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:07,120
But it's Colombia.

979
01:57:07,540 --> 01:57:08,920
It's Bolivia.

980
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:11,100
Okay. We'll see.

981
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:33,380
What I'm saying is that I totally agree with you that the real test for the West is not to miss this moment, to take, how should I put it, settling, getting rid of its own imperialist legacy really effectively.

982
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:38,760
If not, the West will become, maybe survive as an island.

983
01:57:39,620 --> 01:57:42,080
So I totally agree with you.

984
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:44,140
I even written a text on it.

985
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:44,300
So, yeah.

986
01:57:44,300 --> 01:57:46,660
That's, let's end there.

987
01:57:46,820 --> 01:57:48,040
That's, we're way over.

988
01:57:48,180 --> 01:57:49,440
We have to, thank you Slavoj.

989
01:57:49,540 --> 01:57:50,080
Thank you everybody.

990
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:50,180
Thank you.

991
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:51,740
Thank you.

992
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:54,320
Thank you.

993
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:54,620
Thank you.

994
01:57:54,620 --> 01:57:54,740
Thank you.

995
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:54,820
Thank you.

996
01:57:55,640 --> 01:57:56,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
