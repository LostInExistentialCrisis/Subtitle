1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,366
We can all quiet down.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,533
The event is going to begin.

3
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:05,833
My name is Olivia.

4
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:09,266
I work here at Or Books, and I do the events and publicity.

5
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:12,800
And we're really excited to have our wonderful

6
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:16,066
panelists and authors and journalists and activists

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,566
here today, philosophers, for one part of our

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,066
series called Live on Avenue C at Or Books.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,433
Tonight, our event is honor of the release of this

10
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:30,466
wonderful book, which is for sale at the front of the bar.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,300
Deluge, of which both Muin and Coulter are contributors.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,400
Unfortunately, Jamie, the editor,

13
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:44,733
is not able to make it tonight, but Razia, our wonderful moderator,

14
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,366
will open with some remarks by him.

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,600
And we hope you come to more of our wonderful or events.

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,533
The next one is on May 15th for another

17
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:55,200
one of our books, Corporate Coup.

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,200
But for now, I'll turn it over,

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,300
And thank you so much to our panelists and

20
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,400
moderator and all of you for being here tonight.

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,933
Thank you very much.

22
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:04,300
Thank you.

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:04,833
Thank you.

24
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:05,333
Thank you.

25
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:07,166
Thank you.

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,300
Thank you, Olivia.

27
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:10,800
Thank you, Colin, as well.

28
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,766
And thank you very much for coming, everyone.

29
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,066
And thank you to everyone who is joining us online.

30
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,900
For just a moment, if you can imagine that I

31
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,000
am Jamie Stern-Viner, the editor of this book.

32
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:25,000
This is his opening remarks.

33
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:27,000
He's sorry that he can't be here.

34
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:29,566
So, I'd like to begin by thanking Olivia

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,733
from All Books for organizing this

36
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:33,600
meeting, Razia for chairing to me,

37
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,900
and all the panelists for taking part.

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,166
This is a somber event, as book launches go,

39
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:42,000
but then it's a somber book and a somber moment.

40
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:47,366
According to the latest humanitarian reports, Israel has killed

41
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,533
more than 33,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children.

42
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:58,466
has partially or totally destroyed more than 60% of all houses in Gaza.

43
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,866
And a deliberately engineered famine

44
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,300
is imminent, if not already underway.

45
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:08,900
In October, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres observed

46
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:12,600
that this catastrophe, quote, did not happen in a vacuum.

47
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,766
This week, the heroic UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees,

48
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,166
UNRWA, noted that the crisis now unfolding there is unparalleled.

49
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:25,266
Both these statements are true.

50
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,000
What's happening in Gaza is the product of

51
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:30,733
long-standing, multi-layered injustices.

52
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,166
That is to say, decades after decade of

53
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,533
dispossession, annexation, siege and massacre.

54
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,800
And the current catastrophe has also,

55
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,500
in critical respects, broken new ground.

56
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:46,000
With this book I have tried to to illuminate

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,266
both the continuities and the chambers

58
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,866
in what's unfolding in Gaza, to provide

59
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:53,800
readers with the crucial background context

60
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,366
necessary to understand how things came to

61
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,933
this horrific past, while also providing

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,533
an initial analysis of what looks set to be

63
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:04,100
a turning point in the conflict's history.

64
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:09,433
Colter Lewers's chapter in the book, based on his doctoral dissertation,

65
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:13,333
runs through the whole diplomatic background to the conflict since 1967.

66
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:16,800
He authoritatively demonstrates that Israel had chance

67
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:21,566
after chance to resolve the conflict on reasonable

68
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,000
terms, first with the Palestine Liberation Organisation

69
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:27,866
and then after its election in 2006 with hundreds.

70
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:35,333
In my view it's because Israel and its international enablers

71
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:37,433
spurned these opportunities that we are where we are today.

72
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:40,833
Muhin Rabbani's contribution situates the

73
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,600
Gaza war within two crucial regional dynamics.

74
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:47,166
The warming ties between Israel and the Gulf States

75
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,900
facilitated and encouraged by the United States on one hand

76
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:54,066
and on the other hand, relations between Hamas and the

77
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:57,266
so-called Axis of Resistance led by Iran and Hezbollah.

78
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,433
Among the most heart-rending passages

79
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:04,466
in the book are Muhin's descriptions

80
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,900
of the hapless US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, shuttling

81
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:12,100
between Arab governments, cap in hand, begging them to help bail Israel

82
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:15,366
out, only to return with nothing but that broken, dead-eyed stare.

83
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,000
Norman Finkelstein and Slavoj Zizek, of

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,300
course, need no introduction from me.

85
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,233
I merely take this opportunity to thank both for their participation

86
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:28,600
and to extend a special thanks to Norman for his help with the book

87
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:31,300
and for his exemplary life's work standing

88
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,533
for truth and justice come what may.

89
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,033
Beyond the appalling devastation in Gaza,

90
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:39,666
there is a real possibility now that the

91
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,866
conflict will escalate to set the whole region

92
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:44,066
on fire and the rest of the world with it.

93
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,366
The stakes here could not be higher.

94
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:49,700
And so I am glad now to hand over to a panel that could

95
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:53,733
scarcely be better equipped to help guide us through it.

96
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:54,600
Thank you.

97
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,700
And our thanks to Jamie.

98
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,433
Just to give you a quick structure of how we're going to proceed,

99
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,966
each of the panelists is going to speak for about six or seven minutes

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,566
to present what they would like to say about the current crisis.

101
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,633
And then we will, the five of us have a discussion.

102
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,433
Then we will open it up to questions on the floor and

103
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,766
possibly also some questions for the audience online.

104
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,400
I just want to add one other thing before

105
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:27,666
we begin to add to what Jamie has said.

106
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:33,800
The numbers that we are presented with every day seem unfathomable.

107
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,033
Today is Eid al-Fitr.

108
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,433
Eid Mubarak to those who are celebrating and

109
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:45,300
also to those who actually can't celebrate.

110
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,433
And because the numbers are so unfathomable,

111
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:50,966
I want all of us, if we can, to keep in the backs of

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,033
our mind that every life

113
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,766
is a whole world, every life.

114
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,600
And so when we're faced with these enormous numbers,

115
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:06,300
that's the thing that I would like us

116
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,233
to think about while we're absorbing

117
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:13,500
the political analysis, the potential ramifications still to come.

118
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,166
Thank you very much, all of you, for being here tonight.

119
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,766
We're going to start with Colter,

120
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,533
who has, of course, published in this book.

121
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:26,733
Okay, thank you, Razia.

122
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,933
In recent weeks, the Joe Biden administration has

123
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:36,233
claimed that once the current crisis in Gaza is over,

124
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:43,166
it's going to revive, quote, unquote, concerted efforts at

125
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,266
establishing a two-state resolution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.

126
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,466
It's been all the more vehement, however, that there

127
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:53,100
is no place for Hamas in this two-state settlement.

128
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,433
You know the argument.

129
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,633
Hamas is committed to destroying the state of Israel.

130
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,500
Therefore, Hamas itself must be destroyed.

131
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:07,233
Therefore, the genocide in Gaza must continue

132
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:10,533
if we ever want to see any peace in the region.

133
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:16,733
Claims like this, blaming the Palestinian leadership for the

134
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:20,566
Israel-Palestine conflicts infamous intractability are of course not new.

135
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:24,700
Decades ago, the Israeli foreign minister, Aba Eben,

136
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:28,766
claimed that, quote, the Palestinian leadership has never

137
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,933
missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity for peace.

138
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:37,300
Now as my chapter in Deluge attempts to demonstrate,

139
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,766
now the main problem with this claim is that it's

140
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,133
completely contradicted by the factual record.

141
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:48,700
In reality, both the Palestine Liberation

142
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:50,666
Organization, the PLO, and then after at Hamas

143
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,266
have, with varying degrees of clarity, endorsed

144
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,600
a two-state resolution to the conflict,

145
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,966
whereas Israel, of course backed unilaterally by the United States

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,766
has persistently rejected such a resolution in favor of territorial

147
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,566
expansion and has in fact resorted often to very bloody military

148
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,366
assaults in order to derail the threat of Palestinian peace offensives.

149
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,866
If you take the PLO in the aftermath

150
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,000
of the June 1967 war, the PLO initially

151
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:26,866
rejected recognition of Israel for perfectly understandable reasons.

152
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:30,166
did not want to accept a state that had been

153
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:32,900
established on 78% of historic Palestine

154
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:35,433
via the dispossession and displacement

155
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:37,966
of the indigenous Palestinian people.

156
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,533
And yet from the early 1970s, particularly after the October 1973

157
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:46,400
war, Yasser Arafat and the core Palestinian leadership recognized that

158
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:50,833
legitimizing Palestinian claims in the eyes of the international

159
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:54,500
community would necessitate the

160
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:58,166
pragmatic step of recognizing Israel.

161
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,766
And already in January of 1976, the PLO offered to

162
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,333
do just that at the United Nations Security Council.

163
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,266
Predictably, the United States reacted by vetoing the resolution.

164
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,000
Israel, for its part, refused to take

165
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:16,366
part in the Security Council deliberations

166
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,200
and carried out airstrikes in Lebanon

167
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:22,933
against Palestinian refugees, killing dozens.

168
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,166
And as this pattern of Israeli behavior became

169
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,566
more and more manifest in the late 1970s,

170
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:32,833
American officials came to observe that Israeli strikes in South

171
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:37,066
Lebanon had very little to do with

172
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,300
the supposed threat of Palestinian

173
00:09:41,366 --> 00:09:44,600
terror, and in fact everything to do with attempting to batter

174
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:49,233
the Palestinians out of their moderation and back into extremism.

175
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:52,233
The apex of this strategy was of course the

176
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:55,666
June 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon in which,

177
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:59,566
for fear of the fact that the Palestine

178
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,400
Liberation Organization had accepted a ceasefire

179
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:06,633
and strupulously adhered to it for over a

180
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,166
year and that was advocating negotiations once

181
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,700
again, Israel steamrolled into Lebanon, killing

182
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,100
15,000 to 20,000 Palestinians and Lebanese.

183
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,866
Skip ahead 25 years, and Israel's today, or

184
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,366
not today, but in 2006 and after, carried out

185
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,566
the exact same plague book in relation to

186
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,333
its, to the threat of Hamas peace offensives.

187
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,766
Elected in January 2006 on a reform platform, Hamas very

188
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,133
quickly signaled to Washington that it was willing to

189
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:45,466
abandon its notorious 1988 charter and to integrate

190
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,133
itself into negotiations aimed at a two-state settlement.

191
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:52,166
The crucial point is this.

192
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:56,266
In the 15 years since, neither Washington or Tel Aviv has ever once so

193
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:04,000
much as indicated that it would be willing to test that Hamas offer.

194
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:08,733
To the contrary, they immediately moved to punish the Hamas leadership

195
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:15,666
and the people of Gaza through that vile and illegal blockade.

196
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:23,833
When Hamas threatened to break with its assigned role as

197
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:26,400
a rejectionist terrorist group and sought to integrate

198
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:30,000
itself into negotiations, Israel furthermore fell back upon

199
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:33,566
its age-old method, a massive resort to military violence.

200
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:38,500
And as Norman has documented in insane detail, it

201
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:44,500
carried out military operations in 2006, in 2008, in

202
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:48,200
2012, and 2014, in virtually every case, aimed at least

203
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:51,200
in part at derailing Palestinian peace initiatives.

204
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:54,766
And so when the question is raised,

205
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:58,900
how can Israel coexist with Hamas when it refuses to engage in

206
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:05,433
diplomatic activity refuses to recognize Israel, the simple answer

207
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:11,133
is that Hamas tried. It tried that for 15 years and every avenue

208
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:15,433
it sought to go down, it was blocked by American and Israeli power.

209
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:17,900
And as I write in the chapter, the bottom

210
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,566
line is this, that it were it not for the fact

211
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,033
that Israel not only missed but actively

212
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:29,066
spurned and sabotaged, spurned and sabotaged

213
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,966
every Palestinian peace offer, those crimes

214
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,866
crimes committed on October 7th, and the much

215
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:37,233
greater crime that is ongoing, that Israeli

216
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:39,566
genocide in Gaza, would never have happened.

217
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,766
They would never have happened because the

218
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,700
Israel-Palestine conflict would have long been resolved.

219
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:46,733
Thank you very much.

220
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:54,466
Let's turn now to Muin Rabban.

221
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:59,666
Thank you very much, Raziel, and thank you to OR Books

222
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,200
for organizing this event and inviting me to participate.

223
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:08,200
think this is one we're supposed to wave the book around.

224
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:18,100
And I would particularly refer you to not only Walter's outstanding

225
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:25,533
chapter, but also Janie's brilliant introduction to that book.

226
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:32,433
My chapter was about, sorry, yeah, I'll speak closer to the mic.

227
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:36,200
Yes, I'll speak You've also put the line. My chapter

228
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:40,000
was about the regional dynamics of the current crisis.

229
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:45,066
And given time constraints, I'd like to focus on an issue that most

230
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:51,400
insta pundits who have emerged out of the woodworks since October 7,

231
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,400
what for them has been an article of faith, which is

232
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,866
that a primary motivation for Hamas to launch its attacks

233
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:03,966
on Israel on October 7 was to sabotage the prospect

234
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,466
of an imminent Israeli-Saudi normalization agreement.

235
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,466
And I'd like to explain why this was not the case, and that we

236
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,500
should not take these instabundants any more seriously when they

237
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:24,633
were pontificating about Ukraine, before that about COVID and

238
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:30,366
other issues on which they reinvent themselves every few months.

239
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,966
A key issue is that the discussions were not really about

240
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,633
an Israeli-Saudi normalization agreement in the sense

241
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,466
that there would be an agreement where Israel and Saudi

242
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,700
Arabia would make their primary concessions to each other.

243
00:14:55,066 --> 00:15:01,400
Rather, the discussion was about an Israeli-Saudi-US agreement

244
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:05,766
where the key commitments were being made by the United States.

245
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:11,200
And the key commitments the United States was making were

246
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:16,433
to Saudi Arabia, specifically in the form of a security

247
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:19,466
guarantee to Saudi Arabia and in the form of the delivery

248
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:22,300
of a nuclear reactor with enrichment capabilities.

249
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:26,966
And that alone should tell you that such an agreement

250
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,600
was extremely unlikely from the outset, because those

251
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:34,266
are commitments that the United States could only have

252
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,900
implemented if it had obtained congressional approval.

253
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,433
And for a variety of reasons that I won't

254
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:44,233
get into here, it was extremely unlikely

255
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,233
that Congress would have gone along with

256
00:15:47,266 --> 00:15:50,666
such formal US commitments to Saudi Arabia.

257
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:55,266
Secondly, Israel would be required to make a number of gestures

258
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,400
to the Palestinians in the context of such an agreement.

259
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:02,866
And although the gestures were largely of

260
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,233
a cosmetic nature, we were dealing with an

261
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:12,066
Israeli government that is incapable of making

262
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,366
even cosmetic gestures to the Palestinians.

263
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:17,466
And I think the Biden administration at some level was

264
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:20,566
hoping that this would induce the Israeli Prime Minister

265
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,733
Netanyahu to alter his governing position and switch out

266
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:29,533
some of the neo-fascist right parties for more centrist ones.

267
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:32,466
The problem there is that Israel's most prominent opposition leader,

268
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:39,833
Yair Al-Bibt, has been on record repeatedly stating that he would not

269
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:45,500
endorse any normalization agreement with with Saudi Arabia that involved

270
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:52,066
an American commitment to deliver a nuclear reactor to Saudi Arabia.

271
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,933
So my first point is that such an agreement

272
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:59,133
was in any case extremely unlikely.

273
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:03,166
My second point is that even if I'm wrong and such

274
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,233
an agreement had been

275
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:09,300
imminent and if Hamas had

276
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,433
been imminent, such an agreement was about to be

277
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:16,733
signed, it would have made no sense for them to

278
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:18,966
launch this attack in order to sabotage such an

279
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,200
agreement because if we look at the history of

280
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:24,633
Arab-Israeli normalization agreements there is no

281
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:30,100
record of such normalization agreements being reversed

282
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:34,000
or suspended or abrogated on account of Israeli

283
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:38,400
policy towards the Palestinians so if you take the

284
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:41,433
main one the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty it

285
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,733
was essentially unaffected by not only continuing

286
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:52,200
Israeli expansionism in the West Bank and the Gaza

287
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:55,933
Strip, but even wasn't affected by Israel's 1982

288
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:58,600
invasion of Lebanon that Golta referred to, or

289
00:17:58,633 --> 00:18:01,266
the Saba Shatima massacres at their culmination.

290
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,233
Similarly, the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty of 1994 was

291
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:10,700
unaffected by subsequent Israeli policy, including its

292
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:13,866
brutal repression of Palestinians during the Second

293
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,733
Intifada, and the more recent grandiloquently named Abraham

294
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:26,333
Accords that were midwifed by Prince Jared Kushner during

295
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:29,200
the Trump administration were unaffected by, first of all,

296
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,533
the conflict that erupted in 2021, or

297
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:35,333
indeed by the current crisis in civil

298
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:39,866
genocidal assault on the Gaza Strip.

299
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,400
In other words, the most Hamas could have

300
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:55,366
hoped to achieve would have been a decent enter to postpone a Saudi-Israeli

301
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,933
normalization agreement by a decent

302
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:59,000
interval, the corpses were buried and so on.

303
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,233
And I think it's fair to conclude that the Hamas leadership would

304
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:11,566
have concluded that that would simply not have been with the effort.

305
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:15,000
And indeed, if we look at Hamas' statements on October

306
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:18,600
7th and since then, they put out one major statement

307
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:22,833
a few months ago in which they sought to explain and

308
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:27,666
justify and rationalize the attacks of October 7th.

309
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,933
They don't mention Saudi Arabia even once, or the

310
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:34,666
prospects of a Saudi-Israeli normalization of it even once.

311
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,500
They do talk about regional and international neglect

312
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,033
and marginalization of the Taliban question, but

313
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,900
in a much broader sense than in terms of any specific

314
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:49,366
agreements that they were hoping to sabotage.

315
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:50,100
Am I out of time?

316
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,266
I've just got a minute.

317
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,033
So my final observation would be that, yes,

318
00:19:58,466 --> 00:20:04,166
this regional and international marginalization and the left of

319
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,900
the question of Palestine and using Arab-Israeli normalization

320
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:14,566
to oppose Palestinian rights rather than as leverage for

321
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,200
Palestinian rights did factor into it in a general sense.

322
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:22,500
And that also explains, I think, why there

323
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:28,766
has been so little regional and international

324
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,766
response to Israel's genocide was sold against

325
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,000
the Gaza Strip going on now for over half a year.

326
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:33,933
Thank you very much.

327
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:36,133
Thank you.

328
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:41,500
Slavoj Žižek.

329
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,300
Okay.

330
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,133
First, I must emphasize how proud I am to be

331
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,733
here, and sorry if I begin with you, Norman.

332
00:20:49,566 --> 00:20:51,666
I think it will sound pathetic, but I mean

333
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,800
it literally, that the existence of people

334
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:59,266
like you is the best argument against antisemitism.

335
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,100
It's not that people like you unexist.

336
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:03,200
Let me go on.

337
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:05,700
I would like to briefly report on you

338
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:08,633
on my pretty terrifying inner shock.

339
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,066
Maybe some of you know about it, but it happened in Europe.

340
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:16,266
At Stanford, I opened a book, a book fair.

341
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:19,566
Slovenia was the guest of honor, so I was

342
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,933
allowed to speak at the opening ceremony.

343
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:26,633
My speech was, I'm almost ashamed of it,

344
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:30,566
so absolutely careful, moderated and so on.

345
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,900
I said, yes, I condemn Hamas, everything.

346
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,866
My point was just Palestinians are also suffering.

347
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,333
You know what happened?

348
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:47,500
They have now a special position in every German land called

349
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:51,500
beyond factor to cut it short commissar for fighting antisemitism.

350
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,100
And he and another two politicians go to YouTube, you can find

351
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:58,566
it, stood up and like in old communist times, but communists know

352
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,066
it better, stood up and started

353
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:07,966
to shout at me, I'm anti-Semitic,

354
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,800
I am equalizing blah, blah, blah, Hamas, and I'm the worst thing.

355
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,300
I'm contextualizing it.

356
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:20,333
And then there was a series of attacks in big German

357
00:22:20,366 --> 00:22:23,766
newspapers on me, Frankfurter Allgemeine and so on.

358
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,333
The title of one of them is very clear.

359
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,333
Hamas has no context.

360
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:33,900
Like it's literally, you have to understand this,

361
00:22:33,966 --> 00:22:36,833
you have to go back to German idealism metaphysics.

362
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:41,900
The idea is this is absolute original abyssal evil.

363
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,900
No context can

364
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:44,800
even explain it.

365
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,800
And when I then quoted as a reply, Primo

366
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,766
Levi of all guys, who said it's crucial to

367
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,100
analyze Holocaust, not to say this is just

368
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:57,433
evil, I was again attacked, blah, blah.

369
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:00,400
So let me not use, let me not lose time.

370
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:02,600
Another important thing happened there.

371
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,200
I was accused of politicizing the event, book fair,

372
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,000
oh, this is a pure cultural event, blah, blah.

373
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,366
For me, there were five speakers from Germany, all of them openly

374
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:21,533
repeated one motive, full

375
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:25,666
unconditional support for Israel.

376
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:31,000
I just added to it, Palestinians are also suffering.

377
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:34,366
I was accused of politicizing kids.

378
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:39,400
And this brings me to what goes on today, yesterday in Israel.

379
00:23:40,033 --> 00:23:44,033
You know, Anad Mattar, the professor of philosophy there, is now a very sad

380
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:46,866
thing, because she made some for

381
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:52,300
Israel-established and problematic statements.

382
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:54,500
Okay, they want to fire her at the

383
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:57,400
university, but two things are ominous here.

384
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,066
First, students protested against her.

385
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:09,000
I think the same thing I noticed in Reagan's time when I visited Berkeley,

386
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:15,233
professors were usually old 68 guys, much more progressive than students.

387
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:21,166
And I don't know how it is here, but all around Europe, the younger

388
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,400
generation of men mostly is getting absolutely more reactionary.

389
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:30,566
The other thing, Anab Matath's thesis that

390
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,333
every ethics is grounded in a political decision

391
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,800
is fully justified here, because, you see, what

392
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,100
happened in France when they claim, no, the

393
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:44,433
first guys who preach total support from Israel,

394
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:47,666
this was totally apolitical, just compassion

395
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,433
and so on and so on, no, such depoliticization

396
00:24:51,466 --> 00:24:54,933
of judgment is politics at its dirtiest.

397
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,400
Let me go on.

398
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:10,466
The fiasco of German philosophy as an answer to all

399
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,500
these attacks in the corner with them against me, Jurgen

400
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:19,533
Habermas, as close as you can come to a German state

401
00:25:19,566 --> 00:25:23,800
philosopher and two other of his followers wrote a

402
00:25:23,866 --> 00:25:29,366
public letter, they don't mention me, but I have my KGB

403
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,633
agents there, against me claiming, no, unconditional,

404
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,700
you know, the usual bullshit, Israel the only democratic

405
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:40,733
society in the Middle East and so on and so on.

406
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,033
And now I come to conclusion, this is what

407
00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:47,233
fascinates me, even the philosophical importance,

408
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:49,900
You know what Habermas abandons?

409
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:54,666
What the greatest first generation of Frankfurt School,

410
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,733
Adama and Horkheimer, called dialectic of enlightenment,

411
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,800
which means the horrors that were happening,

412
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,833
colonialism or Gulag, Shoah, they are not some remainder

413
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,933
of a dark medieval past, they are the results of

414
00:26:10,966 --> 00:26:15,000
the imminent antagonisms of the project of European

415
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:19,066
modernity. With Khabramas, this disappears, just we

416
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,133
need more European enlightenment and so on and so on.

417
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,800
To conclude, then you can ask me questions if you want.

418
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,333
You know, we really live in sad times.

419
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:35,533
Not only is Germany, I can explain it more,

420
00:26:35,566 --> 00:26:39,366
doing the most unethical thing you can imagine.

421
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Everybody knows.

422
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:45,833
the logic is we did the holocaust so now as a dirty

423
00:26:45,866 --> 00:26:50,566
deal with israel will say you were our victims

424
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,700
but in exchange we tolerate your crimes today

425
00:26:54,733 --> 00:27:00,033
it's disgusting and just to conclude you know

426
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:05,400
people like to mention what happens today in haiti gangs taking over

427
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:11,166
but it's not just haiti even in the developed states everywhere.

428
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,666
Did you notice how the state power

429
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:19,100
cannot reproduce itself without direct use

430
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:22,133
of what are ultimately criminal gangs?

431
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:25,133
Trump here needs proud boys and so on.

432
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:29,600
And in Israel, let's face it, settler's movement of the West Bank

433
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:37,166
are illegal criminal gangs subtly used by Israeli establishment.

434
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:43,200
And this is where we are, unfortunately, where we are coming today.

435
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:46,833
To use the pathetic term, half a minute,

436
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:49,733
the masks are falling, literally.

437
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:53,466
I was shocked, you know, my reaction was like, you know,

438
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,266
in Tom and Jerry, when something happens, the eyes pop out,

439
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,333
and then my reaction when Netanyahu, a month ago or when,

440
00:28:02,366 --> 00:28:06,400
said publicly, from the river to the sea, but the big Israel.

441
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,066
So what was still now done more discreetly is now done openly.

442
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:19,733
We are entering a new era, extremely dangerous

443
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,366
era, and I, in all my naivety, who still think

444
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,466
maybe there is something good, although they

445
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,133
are hypocritical in this European human rights,

446
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,466
I'm saying what is happening now in Gaza is the death of Europe.

447
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:41,000
In the sense of, you know, you talk to a Palestinian, he will tell

448
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:45,266
you, yes, European human rights are bumps which are falling on us.

449
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,300
And finally, Norman Finkelstein.

450
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,100
Thank you.

451
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:05,733
Is it working?

452
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:06,166
Yes.

453
00:29:06,966 --> 00:29:12,633
Well, thank you for having me, and I want to

454
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:18,333
publicly thank Jenny Sternweiler and Holter

455
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,900
because both of them represent, for me at any rate, both of them at

456
00:29:23,966 --> 00:29:29,700
their relatively young ages, and they represent the new generation.

457
00:29:30,966 --> 00:29:34,566
For myself, I feel very hopeful that they

458
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,200
will carry on the tradition of trying to

459
00:29:38,266 --> 00:29:41,866
fight back and trying to use your mind,

460
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:45,533
as well as your passion, in the struggle.

461
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:53,733
Muin is an old friend at this point, and a colleague and a comrade,

462
00:29:53,766 --> 00:30:02,700
and we both together had our date with destiny, which will probably

463
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:06,566
be marked as a world historic event, and I'm glad it was with

464
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:13,466
Muin, although I still insist he was much too proper for my case.

465
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:21,833
There's obviously no silver lining in a genocide,

466
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:27,300
and it would be sinful to try to pretend there's one.

467
00:30:28,366 --> 00:30:32,966
So, not casting it as a silver lining, I would rather simply cast

468
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
my remarks as why I believe, as

469
00:30:37,066 --> 00:30:41,933
sparing it as the situation is, why

470
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,700
I believe what we're doing is useful and why we should not, for a

471
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:53,066
moment, relent in the face of

472
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,566
with clearly unsatisfactory results.

473
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,400
So I'm just going to review some items from the

474
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:04,133
past six months which have made me hopeful, even

475
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:10,966
though, as I say, for those who won't make it

476
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,766
to the finishing line, there is no consolation.

477
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,266
This will be a very personalized list.

478
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:23,300
As we will attest, very early on in the events

479
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:28,933
following October 7, there were some people who

480
00:31:28,966 --> 00:31:32,033
were pressing to try to make this a genocide

481
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:37,166
case before the International Court of Justice,

482
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:44,066
and I found that wholly a waste of time.

483
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,366
I couldn't believe that any country on God's

484
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:57,500
earth would risk a confrontation with the United

485
00:31:57,533 --> 00:32:00,933
States on behalf of an effectively stateless

486
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:05,166
people and a people without no power and no wealth.

487
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:12,033
So I was quite shocked when South Africa stepped

488
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,266
forward, and stepped forward not just as a token

489
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,300
gesture, but they stepped forward in a very

490
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:23,066
professional and one would have to say profound way.

491
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:29,066
They produced an application for the court, which

492
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:33,466
had literally applications like a brief for the

493
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,300
court, which had literally hundreds of footnotes

494
00:32:36,366 --> 00:32:39,166
and was extremely polished in its presentation.

495
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:45,133
They chose very impressive people to represent South Africa, including my

496
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,766
old friend John Dugard, the international jurist, and a very impressive

497
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:57,333
fellow who even at 87 years old and he was wobbling a little as he came

498
00:32:57,366 --> 00:33:01,466
up to the microphone, but he still

499
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,866
gave a very powerful presentation.

500
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:11,866
In many ways it was a beautiful delegation of men,

501
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:18,433
women, black, white, foreigners, South Africans.

502
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:26,333
It was, to the extent that it's possible, it sort of was anticipatory

503
00:33:26,366 --> 00:33:31,733
of a better world and they were doing it all for the people of Gaza.

504
00:33:33,866 --> 00:33:37,166
One of the things that struck me about the footnotes, and

505
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,366
here are notes that I found a little academic but will forgive

506
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:44,600
me, one of the things that struck me about the footnotes is

507
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:48,933
it depended entirely on UN agencies and UN documentation.

508
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:54,366
There are a few references to human rights groups, and

509
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:01,266
for anybody who has been involved in this matter for a

510
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,700
sustained period of time, you know that there are hundreds

511
00:34:04,733 --> 00:34:08,133
and hundreds and hundreds of reports put out every year.

512
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:12,366
And you can't but roll your eyes and wonder,

513
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,300
isn't this all a waste of trees, this

514
00:34:15,366 --> 00:34:19,133
accumulation of reports which really nobody

515
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:22,933
except maybe five people on God's earth read?

516
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:30,400
And suddenly all the labors of those people who week

517
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:36,733
after week after week chronicled the death, the hunger,

518
00:34:36,766 --> 00:34:42,033
the destruction, and all those papers which were just

519
00:34:42,033 --> 00:34:48,100
accumulating dust and cobwebs, they suddenly came to life.

520
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:56,000
It was for myself an awakening that sometimes

521
00:34:56,033 --> 00:35:00,900
you're laboring away in a corner, think

522
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:05,300
it's all a waste of time, why am I doing this,

523
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:09,666
nobody's reading it, and suddenly it became

524
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:14,600
the raw material for an application to the

525
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:19,533
ICJ, which was because of the precision,

526
00:35:19,566 --> 00:35:24,200
Because of the neutrality of the organizations,

527
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:28,300
it became irresistible and invincible.

528
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:34,800
And that brings me to the third point, what happened on the ICJ itself.

529
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:43,966
I spoke every day, either in email or a conversation with Maureen.

530
00:35:44,966 --> 00:35:46,266
I kept doing the numbers.

531
00:35:46,966 --> 00:35:50,633
There's no possibility they can get more than

532
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:54,833
six states on board for this plausible genocide.

533
00:35:56,533 --> 00:36:00,200
I would name the states and, of course, I said, of course, forget

534
00:36:00,266 --> 00:36:03,933
the United States, forget Germany, don't even waste your time.

535
00:36:04,466 --> 00:36:05,933
I also said forget Australia.

536
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,266
I was happily wrong.

537
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,066
I'm glad I'm wrong for a good cause.

538
00:36:13,033 --> 00:36:13,500
It was 15 to 2.

539
00:36:15,866 --> 00:36:20,200
The only two dissents were the Israeli judge

540
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:23,366
and the court, and this woman from Uganda.

541
00:36:24,366 --> 00:36:28,200
I hope she got a nice car and a ring for her,

542
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:32,066
which clearly she didn't even write what she wrote.

543
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,433
It was very obvious.

544
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:39,766
Then the ICJ was fifteen to two, but it didn't stop.

545
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:44,233
Africa went back a second time.

546
00:36:44,233 --> 00:36:49,133
It produced a very professional statement again.

547
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,466
A lot of footnotes.

548
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:58,266
It went back a third time for the people of Gaza.

549
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,966
It wouldn't stop.

550
00:37:00,966 --> 00:37:02,166
It wouldn't relent.

551
00:37:03,566 --> 00:37:09,200
And then a new case was opened up before the

552
00:37:09,233 --> 00:37:12,466
ICJ regarding a Kindred but separate matter.

553
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:17,433
So now there are two Israel cases in the ICJ.

554
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:21,100
And then lo and behold, guess what happens?

555
00:37:22,133 --> 00:37:28,466
Nicaragua enters the picture and it files a case

556
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:33,500
against Germany for abandoning the genocide in Gaza.

557
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:42,333
You suddenly saw all these possibilities open up for initiatives.

558
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,533
They haven't resolved anything for

559
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:52,800
sure, but possibilities, potentialities.

560
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:57,000
I haven't yet read the German, the Nicaraguan

561
00:37:57,033 --> 00:38:00,500
one, or the German response, but I have to

562
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:04,000
say I had a hearty laugh because I did listen

563
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:07,533
to one of the spokespersons for the Germans.

564
00:38:07,566 --> 00:38:12,933
The Germans like to say, oh, we do it for states for its own

565
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,800
because we have a special who committed to Israel because of the

566
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:19,166
Holocaust, and the Nicaraguan, he steps up to the, who was a

567
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,200
farmer, who was the Nicaraguan representative to the Netherlands.

568
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,200
He says, well, you know what, the Germans

569
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:30,433
are making a lot of money off of this war,

570
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,133
and he starts going through all the military

571
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:37,166
contracts, and suddenly the mask is off a little.

572
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:40,333
all about states' raison, you know, serenity

573
00:38:40,366 --> 00:38:44,900
terminology, and making a lot of bucks off of it.

574
00:38:46,800 --> 00:39:00,866
I'm going to have to wrap up, I want to give credit to two groups of people.

575
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,066
First of all, I found the reaction of the young

576
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,966
people in the past six months to be absolutely

577
00:39:10,033 --> 00:39:13,966
heroic and totally inspiring, the fact that they

578
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,833
keep coming out, coming out, and coming out.

579
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:20,466
I don't remember that from the War of Vietnam days.

580
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:25,066
We would have a mass demonstration maybe once every six

581
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,866
months or maybe more, maybe once every three months.

582
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,800
But the persistence, the tenacity of the

583
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:33,933
young people has been truly inspiring.

584
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:37,633
I know when I go to the demonstrations,

585
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:41,100
there's usually 40 years separating me

586
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:43,300
and the next oldest person in the crowd,

587
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,333
mostly 25-year-olds, I would guess.

588
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,400
And the last group of people I would want

589
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:55,233
to acknowledge are the hoofies. I find it

590
00:39:55,266 --> 00:39:59,066
deeply inspiring that the poorest nation on

591
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,900
earth, as I understand it, is that correct?

592
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:07,666
In the Middle East because I read it the other day

593
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:10,966
on the planet, but no, it's in the Middle East.

594
00:40:11,466 --> 00:40:14,600
Their tenacity, their willingness to suffer,

595
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:17,800
and it always brings to mind, and I'll end

596
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:21,433
on that note, for those of you who have read

597
00:40:21,466 --> 00:40:25,066
Rousseau's Second Discourse, he makes the

598
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,000
argument that what he calls savage man is

599
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:32,966
much more moral than civilized man, because

600
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,900
he says the thing that humanizes people, who

601
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:40,833
makes people human, it's not their reason,

602
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:48,600
it's their capacity for pity, and that pity is a natural faculty and

603
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:53,700
pity is the source of everything that's positive in human beings.

604
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:58,533
And he says, the more educated you become,

605
00:40:58,566 --> 00:41:03,100
first of all, the more egotistical you become,

606
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:06,866
and secondly, with your education you develop

607
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,533
the faculty to rationalize doing nothing.

608
00:41:11,766 --> 00:41:18,133
So he says, a philosopher who looks out his window

609
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:24,533
and sees somebody being monged on his Outside

610
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:28,666
in the street the philosopher only has to close

611
00:41:28,733 --> 00:41:32,833
his ears and say Perish if you will, I am safe

612
00:41:33,966 --> 00:41:36,800
That's the philosophy of the philosopher's credo

613
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,700
But those who are not being quote-unquote civilized

614
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:46,333
They don't have the capacity to rationalize

615
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,766
their indifference to human suffering and

616
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:56,100
And, I've always found that to be a credible thesis, and

617
00:41:56,133 --> 00:42:01,633
I think it's borne out by the actions of the Houthis.

618
00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:05,500
Yesterday, Jamie, as it happens, he sent me a clip, which I

619
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:10,100
guess you saw, and it was some Yemeni fishermen, they were

620
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:15,133
anti-Houthi, and they were talking about how they're suffering

621
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:20,133
because the U.S. is here, Iran is there, and they can't fish.

622
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:26,066
But they said, and we can affirm it, they said,

623
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:31,000
we don't care, the people of Gaza are suffering.

624
00:42:31,266 --> 00:42:32,433
The Houthis are their enemy.

625
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:36,233
They said, we don't care if it's for the

626
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,866
suffering people of Palestine, of Gaza.

627
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:40,433
We accept it.

628
00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:45,433
It was a beautiful sentiment and an inspiring one for me.

629
00:42:54,966 --> 00:42:55,200
Thank you.

630
00:42:55,966 --> 00:42:56,833
Thank you all very much.

631
00:42:56,966 --> 00:42:59,733
I want to start by asking each of you really, let's stick with you

632
00:42:59,766 --> 00:43:02,533
Norman in the first instance because you talked about the hope that

633
00:43:02,566 --> 00:43:09,366
the ICJ case, the one that South Africa brought gave you, and at the

634
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:14,200
time the US Secretary of State said that the case was without merit.

635
00:43:14,966 --> 00:43:20,333
similar was said immediately after the case had been presented

636
00:43:20,366 --> 00:43:24,033
and Israel had presented its defense and just a couple of days

637
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:28,566
ago in front of the Senate the US Secretary of Defense said

638
00:43:28,633 --> 00:43:32,000
there was nothing to see here they had no evidence of a genocide.

639
00:43:32,033 --> 00:43:36,866
Given that what the United States does and its very very slow shifting

640
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,733
position over the last six months what what do you make of what What

641
00:43:41,766 --> 00:43:50,066
is possible for the United States in terms of saving face, a profound

642
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:55,633
change in U.S. foreign policy, it's changing attitude towards Israel.

643
00:43:56,866 --> 00:44:01,300
How do you reflect on what they've been saying to date, very recently?

644
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:06,866
Well, I think the biggest change, it's not at the practical

645
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,733
political level, it's at the level of public opinion.

646
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,366
And I'll give you two examples to illustrate the point.

647
00:44:16,566 --> 00:44:24,500
The first, almost breathtaking moment was when Charles

648
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:31,066
Schumer delivered his speech on the current situation.

649
00:44:32,033 --> 00:44:35,033
Now Senator Schumer has been in the U.S. Senate

650
00:44:35,066 --> 00:44:38,066
the foremost supporter of the State of Israel.

651
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:40,266
He opposed the Iran deal.

652
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:43,533
I think he and Menendez in New Jersey were the only two

653
00:44:43,566 --> 00:44:47,233
senior senators, Democrat senators, to oppose the deal.

654
00:44:48,266 --> 00:44:50,733
And he has an awful track record.

655
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:56,266
In 2010, he went before a group of Orthodox rabbis, and he said that we

656
00:44:56,266 --> 00:45:02,133
should economically strangle Gaza, you know, Gaza with a million children.

657
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,133
He said we should economically strangle it.

658
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,566
He read his speech, it was quite remarkable.

659
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:18,833
First of all, he allocated exactly the same degree of responsibility for

660
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,700
the current impasse to Israel and to

661
00:45:20,766 --> 00:45:22,566
Hamas, or Israel and the Palestinians.

662
00:45:23,366 --> 00:45:26,366
He said on the one hand the problem is Netanyahu

663
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,266
and the Israeli far right, and then he said

664
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:32,833
on the other hand, the problem is Hamas and

665
00:45:32,866 --> 00:45:36,366
the corruption of the Palestinian authority.

666
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:39,333
He was very careful to balance it.

667
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:44,433
And then he proceeded to try to defend the claim

668
00:45:44,466 --> 00:45:49,433
that Israel is not a settler colonial state.

669
00:45:49,466 --> 00:45:52,500
About six months ago that wasn't even a

670
00:45:52,533 --> 00:45:55,566
subject of discussion among those elites.

671
00:45:55,566 --> 00:46:00,500
But But suddenly he felt compelled to rationally

672
00:46:00,533 --> 00:46:05,466
explain why he thought that's historically incorrect.

673
00:46:07,066 --> 00:46:10,266
And then he proceeded to have to explain

674
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,400
why the idea of one state was wrong.

675
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,400
One state is officially by the IHRA – International House

676
00:46:18,433 --> 00:46:22,133
and Residence Association – definition of antisemitism.

677
00:46:23,066 --> 00:46:26,200
One state is officially anti-Semitic.

678
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:28,466
What did Schumer do?

679
00:46:29,766 --> 00:46:33,733
Senator Schumer began by saying, I know many

680
00:46:33,766 --> 00:46:37,733
idealistic young people support one state.

681
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:41,100
He didn't say they're all anti-Semites.

682
00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:44,933
He said they're idealistic young people.

683
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:50,600
And so now you saw the Democratic Party has to contend

684
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:55,366
with a new reality at the base of that party, namely

685
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:02,300
there is something fundamentally illegitimate about

686
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:08,133
Israel, either historically or as a Jewish state.

687
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:13,500
And that to me is in a very short period of time,

688
00:47:13,566 --> 00:47:16,800
though you could say it was percolating for a long time.

689
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,133
That's a historical shift in public opinion.

690
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:22,333
One last thing and I'll make it very big.

691
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:24,300
I opened up the New York Times yesterday.

692
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,233
They have this article about how Iran is supplying all

693
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:34,200
these weapons to the West Bank and a giant yuan from there.

694
00:47:34,233 --> 00:47:36,466
So I was just curious.

695
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,266
I turned According to the letter's comment section,

696
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,133
I sent it to Moin, and he again can affirm,

697
00:47:44,266 --> 00:47:46,066
you know what the letter's read like?

698
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:51,533
Why shouldn't Iran supply weapons to the West Bank?

699
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:54,300
They're going to occupy people, they have the right

700
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:56,466
to arm resistance, and who the hell is the United

701
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:02,000
States talking about other countries supplying

702
00:48:02,033 --> 00:48:05,833
weapons to people in the vote? I was totally shy.

703
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:10,000
This is the New York Times, usually letters

704
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:14,100
like that would just go right for the discard.

705
00:48:14,966 --> 00:48:16,833
And suddenly there was one, am I

706
00:48:16,866 --> 00:48:19,300
correct, one after another after another.

707
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:25,500
So even the Times readers have fallen out of

708
00:48:25,566 --> 00:48:29,333
the range of legitimate opinion on this time.

709
00:48:30,766 --> 00:48:37,966
I wonder if we can bring you in here on this whole issue of

710
00:48:37,966 --> 00:48:40,333
the two-state solution versus the one-state solution because

711
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,566
for so long the two-state solution has been the mantra and

712
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:49,966
increasingly people are talking about it as being a hollow mantra

713
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,633
and of course there are huge problems from all

714
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:58,833
sorts of sides if we talk about one-state solution

715
00:48:58,866 --> 00:49:03,500
because it then means that it's no longer an

716
00:49:03,533 --> 00:49:05,966
ethno-nationalist project, it's no longer a Jewish state.

717
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,233
I wonder how you would reflect on the

718
00:49:10,266 --> 00:49:14,066
shift inside the Middle East on that issue.

719
00:49:14,533 --> 00:49:18,900
Yes, well, I would have three comments.

720
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:23,566
I think the first one to make is that when Western

721
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:27,733
politicians talk about a two-state settlement,

722
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:32,333
We need to look at their actions and not their words, and

723
00:49:32,366 --> 00:49:36,233
for them, two-state settlement is a diversionary charade.

724
00:49:37,033 --> 00:49:38,000
It's smoke and mirrors.

725
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,666
It's to use words to deflect attention from

726
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,466
their actions, because their actions are

727
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:49,466
undermining any settlement, and most particularly

728
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,366
the prospect of an end to Israeli occupation,

729
00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:57,333
because that's being entrenched with the act of

730
00:49:57,366 --> 00:50:01,833
support and or passive act. essence of Western states.

731
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:06,000
The second question becomes whether a two-state settlement

732
00:50:06,033 --> 00:50:10,000
remains practical or is it practical, is it feasible?

733
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,666
And I've written about this and I think that as a

734
00:50:15,733 --> 00:50:19,400
practical matter, a two-state settlement remains feasible.

735
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,600
An Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 boundaries.

736
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:27,466
And the The dismantling of the settlements and a just

737
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,300
resolution to the refugee question, as a matter of principle,

738
00:50:31,366 --> 00:50:35,766
remains practical and I think a useful way to look at

739
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:43,433
this is to compare Israel's position in the West Bank with

740
00:50:43,466 --> 00:50:48,433
Britain's position in Ireland in 1915, France's position in

741
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:54,366
Algeria in 1950, Ethiopia's position in Tigray, sorry, in

742
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,833
Eritrea in 1985, Indonesia's position in East Timor in

743
00:50:59,866 --> 00:51:05,300
1990, and I think in all of those cases you find, excuse me,

744
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:10,033
a foreign presence that was in many respects more entrenched

745
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:16,866
than is the Israeli presence in the occupied territories.

746
00:51:16,966 --> 00:51:21,900
Now, the third point becomes, OK, well, if it is indeed

747
00:51:21,933 --> 00:51:25,133
practical, what has happened in the past six months?

748
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:28,066
And here I would argue that for many

749
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,900
people who previously consider this

750
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,400
practical, who also consider it no

751
00:51:33,433 --> 00:51:36,533
longer desirable, the question becomes,

752
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,433
can you have lasting, durable peace in the Middle East with the

753
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:50,866
continued existence of a irrational, genocidal, apartheid regime?

754
00:51:51,533 --> 00:51:56,133
Or does this regime and its key institutions need to be

755
00:51:56,166 --> 00:52:00,766
dismantled as a precondition for peace in the Middle East?

756
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:05,233
And I think these are questions that are increasingly

757
00:52:05,266 --> 00:52:08,933
being raised that are open for discussion.

758
00:52:09,066 --> 00:52:13,700
I don't think there are easy answers in this respect.

759
00:52:14,066 --> 00:52:19,100
And my last comment also is that I do not in any way base

760
00:52:19,133 --> 00:52:24,166
my analysis on the so-called failure of the Oslo process.

761
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,933
I think Oslo has been one of the most successful diplomatic processes

762
00:52:28,966 --> 00:52:33,000
since 1945 for the simple reason that it was never about ending occupation.

763
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,800
It was never about a two-state settlement.

764
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:37,433
It was never about establishing an independent

765
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,900
Palestinian state, it was about reformulating and

766
00:52:39,933 --> 00:52:45,566
consolidating permanent Israeli control over the

767
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,633
Palestinians, and to that extent it's been a success.

768
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,600
Coleman, do you want to come back and respond to that?

769
00:52:54,233 --> 00:52:56,866
My own view is that now is simply not

770
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,533
the time to be talking about solutions.

771
00:53:00,566 --> 00:53:03,300
First of all, there's no representative

772
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:06,566
Palestinian organization to negotiate with.

773
00:53:07,666 --> 00:53:10,233
And the Israeli political spectrum is—

774
00:53:10,266 --> 00:53:13,333
and I don't use the term loosely, I've not

775
00:53:13,366 --> 00:53:15,733
used it before, but I don't use it loosely—the

776
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,866
Israeli political spectrum is insane.

777
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,733
It goes from the right to the far right to the ultra-right.

778
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:25,700
There's no center and there's no left, that's just a factual matter.

779
00:53:27,366 --> 00:53:30,900
So there's nothing to negotiate with.

780
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:34,233
You could say around 2000 with the Camp David

781
00:53:34,266 --> 00:53:36,766
Accord, with the Oslo and the Camp David,

782
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,433
you could say in those years, and you look closely at the

783
00:53:41,466 --> 00:53:43,833
negotiations that I have, they were arguing about percentages.

784
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,466
So Ehul Barak says we want to keep 80%

785
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,966
of the settlers, the illegal settlers,

786
00:53:50,033 --> 00:53:55,033
we want to keep them in any final settlement, we want to keep 80 percent.

787
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,300
Elmer says we want to keep 87 percent.

788
00:54:02,233 --> 00:54:05,033
The Palestinians say you can keep 60 percent.

789
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:14,166
Israelis say we want to keep about 10 percent of the West Bank.

790
00:54:15,133 --> 00:54:21,000
The Palestinians say, we'll let you keep 2% of the West Bank.

791
00:54:21,766 --> 00:54:23,800
Now, I'm not saying they were close.

792
00:54:25,166 --> 00:54:30,200
There was still a gap, maybe not a chasm, but there was a significant gap.

793
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,600
But we were talking about percentages.

794
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,166
Now the current government of Israel, we can't extract from

795
00:54:36,233 --> 00:54:43,733
them a broom closet or a bread box for the Palestinians.

796
00:54:44,066 --> 00:54:48,200
So there's no place for discussion at this point.

797
00:54:48,666 --> 00:54:53,800
There are no two sites where any kind of argument can even be made.

798
00:54:55,366 --> 00:54:58,933
Just the second thing, we have to be realistic, in my opinion.

799
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:03,066
We still may be very—wars can last a long time.

800
00:55:05,466 --> 00:55:07,866
The Ukraine war is over two years now, and then you can

801
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:12,000
look at the Vietnam War or you can look at World War II.

802
00:55:12,966 --> 00:55:16,866
After about six months, I don't like to say it, but I think there's a

803
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:23,600
very good chance we're still closer to the beginning than to the end.

804
00:55:24,933 --> 00:55:27,833
Because if you read the Israeli statements

805
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,733
and you read the analyses, like I read

806
00:55:30,766 --> 00:55:36,566
one last night from JINSA, one of these

807
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:41,233
Jewish neoconservative lunatic organizations,

808
00:55:41,266 --> 00:55:44,600
and They say no end is possible unless

809
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:47,933
there is an absolute, total, unequivocal

810
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,100
defeat inflicted on Hamas and an absolute,

811
00:55:52,133 --> 00:55:56,133
total, unequivocal victory for Israel.

812
00:55:57,466 --> 00:56:02,166
And on the other side, groups like Hezbollah

813
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:06,933
are saying we will not accept a total,

814
00:56:06,966 --> 00:56:09,933
unequivocal defeat by Hamas, that we

815
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:13,633
will do what's necessary to prevent that.

816
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:23,933
And so I believe we still might be quite far from the end of this current

817
00:56:23,966 --> 00:56:29,200
situation, and It's just pointless now to be talking about solutions.

818
00:56:30,966 --> 00:56:35,533
Slava, let's talk about the kind of moral reckoning that needs to take place.

819
00:56:36,366 --> 00:56:39,266
Even if we were to accept what Norman is saying,

820
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:42,166
that this could go on for a lot, lot longer,

821
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:45,666
the fact that it has got as far as it has now,

822
00:56:46,633 --> 00:56:47,933
with 33,000 people being killed in six months,

823
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:56,500
which might have seemed unthinkable when you compare it, say, to 2021,

824
00:56:57,966 --> 00:56:59,533
when, you know, Korta, help me with the

825
00:56:59,566 --> 00:57:01,500
numbers, how many people were killed in 2021?

826
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,066
So it was 1,600 or something like that.

827
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,866
The biggest ones Operation Cast Lead was 1,200 people, 1,400 people.

828
00:57:09,966 --> 00:57:12,700
Operation Protective Edge was 2,200 people killed,

829
00:57:14,133 --> 00:57:16,466
so we're just, you know, completely different.

830
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:22,033
So given that the Western world, which continues to regard itself,

831
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,300
even though that kind of idea is falling

832
00:57:24,366 --> 00:57:26,433
apart before our very eyes, still continues

833
00:57:26,466 --> 00:57:29,500
to regard itself as the kind of moral

834
00:57:29,566 --> 00:57:32,600
arbiter of what happens in the world.

835
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,900
What are we to make of the need for a moral reckoning of the failure to

836
00:57:35,933 --> 00:57:43,133
have protected the thousands and thousands of innocent people in Gaza?

837
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:48,100
Crucial question, I would like just to make

838
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:50,100
some brief remarks so that I don't get lost.

839
00:57:50,566 --> 00:57:53,066
First, that problem about 30,000 dead and so on,

840
00:57:54,533 --> 00:57:57,700
I think it's not just a question of data.

841
00:57:58,466 --> 00:58:01,900
Even the Western media don't deny this data.

842
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,500
But there is, especially in Germany, but also in

843
00:58:06,533 --> 00:58:11,166
other states, there is one mode of interpreting it,

844
00:58:11,566 --> 00:58:13,866
and in Germany, it's legalized.

845
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:18,033
Even the relatively moderate minister of culture,

846
00:58:18,366 --> 00:58:24,966
I would call her minister of barbarism Claudia Roach, she explicitly

847
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:31,600
said, she said, you can literally, again, I had a Tom and Jerry reaction,

848
00:58:31,666 --> 00:58:36,133
she said, yes, we can talk about Palestinian suffering, but we should

849
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:40,633
make it clear that ultimately Hamas which is responsible for it.

850
00:58:41,433 --> 00:58:46,100
So it's as if, you know, Hamas is engaged in a big suicidal operation and

851
00:58:46,133 --> 00:58:51,800
Israel just somehow got God into it, you know, this has to be changed.

852
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:58,500
And also, to change, as it was pointed out, this public perception is crucial.

853
00:58:59,066 --> 00:59:03,000
For example, we should insist how Israel – okay, we hear from

854
00:59:03,033 --> 00:59:09,300
Habermas and so on, the only democratic state – I'm sorry, but a

855
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:14,200
month ago or when Netanyahu justified the opposition against a

856
00:59:14,233 --> 00:59:17,466
two-state solution which meant big Israel from the river to the sea.

857
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,666
He said it's the only democratic solution

858
00:59:20,733 --> 00:59:23,900
because, I don't know if this is true, but he

859
00:59:23,933 --> 00:59:26,300
wrote some statistic that now almost 90, 90

860
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:31,966
percent of Jews there in Israel are against it.

861
00:59:32,966 --> 00:59:37,400
I'm sorry, but if you take into account all the

862
00:59:37,433 --> 00:59:38,900
area controlled by Israel, it's almost 50-50.

863
00:59:40,666 --> 00:59:44,433
There are just a little bit more maybe Jews than Palestinians.

864
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:51,100
She even didn't mention, you see, this is apartheid in practice.

865
00:59:52,133 --> 00:59:53,866
So what can we do?

866
00:59:54,666 --> 00:59:57,333
And another thing, maybe along the practical

867
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,566
lines that you normally emphasize public opinion,

868
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:04,733
Something will happen like I know.

869
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:09,166
Maybe I have a little bit to push into their

870
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,466
asses with some of my influence in Slovenia,

871
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,066
but I learned from reliable sources that now,

872
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:23,233
till the end of June, July, Spain, Ireland,

873
01:00:24,766 --> 01:00:30,600
and this is very nice here, my small influence comes Slovenia and, okay,

874
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:37,166
it's not the greatest say in the world, will publicly recognize Palestine.

875
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:40,833
And these small signs that you normally mention

876
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:47,233
didn't even a guy whom I would not trust my mother to his house.

877
01:00:48,266 --> 01:00:52,300
David Cameron, at some point, mentioned maybe we should.

878
01:00:52,366 --> 01:00:53,666
Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom.

879
01:00:54,033 --> 01:00:54,600
Yeah, yeah.

880
01:00:54,966 --> 01:00:55,833
And yeah, yeah.

881
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:58,166
And you know what's now this political

882
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,200
situation in the United Kingdom, though?

883
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:04,466
You had one big, big central right-wing party.

884
01:01:04,966 --> 01:01:07,066
It's called a Labour Party.

885
01:01:07,433 --> 01:01:10,400
Then you have some more crazy right-wing party.

886
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,766
Okay, but what's about, sorry, let me go on.

887
01:01:14,066 --> 01:01:17,566
So what I want to say is that now we have

888
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,066
to make, as you pointed out, the next step.

889
01:01:20,566 --> 01:01:25,200
Now it's legitimized to talk about Palestinian suffering.

890
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:28,700
And now we go to the next stage

891
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,033
Well, what does this suffering mean?

892
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:35,666
The logic if, yes, you have to sympathize, you break, you put those

893
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:41,233
stupid, how do you call it, parachutes with, but what does this mean?

894
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,600
I think there is one, there is one thought of

895
01:01:44,633 --> 01:01:47,633
it for me is the best symbol of the situation.

896
01:01:48,466 --> 01:01:50,033
I found it in big media.

897
01:01:50,366 --> 01:01:57,833
It's the same photo you see from Gaza, you see in front Israeli bombs,

898
01:01:58,133 --> 01:02:02,866
bombs made by USA, falling on Gaza, destroying buildings,

899
01:02:03,266 --> 01:02:07,666
and just behind, parachutes with food falling down.

900
01:02:08,733 --> 01:02:09,366
That's the catch.

901
01:02:09,466 --> 01:02:12,766
So let me just very briefly to conclude with one remark.

902
01:02:15,866 --> 01:02:17,400
You know where we have to work.

903
01:02:18,066 --> 01:02:22,400
How these prohibitions, what, where is it permitted to say?

904
01:02:22,666 --> 01:02:25,166
When I said what I said in Frankfurt,

905
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:30,233
The most disgusting thing for me is that literally dozens of

906
01:02:30,266 --> 01:02:34,333
people, hardline Germans, came to me privately, literally looked

907
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:39,133
around carefully and then whispered to me, you know, basically

908
01:02:39,166 --> 01:02:42,600
I agree with you, it's just not the right moment to say it.

909
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:45,666
My answer was, of course, I know what you mean.

910
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:50,666
The right moment will be to say it when it will mean nothing to say it.

911
01:02:50,766 --> 01:02:53,300
Now it means something to say this.

912
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,033
So you know what, really, I wonder if I address

913
01:02:56,066 --> 01:02:59,466
this also to you so that finally would agree.

914
01:03:00,166 --> 01:03:01,400
I don't trust them.

915
01:03:01,866 --> 01:03:04,800
But for example, you probably all

916
01:03:04,866 --> 01:03:07,800
know who me, if you are intelligent, but

917
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:10,000
also the ex-bosses of Sinbad Moser,

918
01:03:10,033 --> 01:03:12,566
but a guy called, I think, Ami Ayadon.

919
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:14,033
Okay.

920
01:03:14,366 --> 01:03:15,133
He's now retired.

921
01:03:15,466 --> 01:03:18,533
Once you are retired, you can say many things,

922
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,666
but nonetheless, he wrote a comment or interview

923
01:03:21,966 --> 01:03:24,566
where he said the only solution is allow

924
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,200
political subjectivity to Palestinians

925
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:32,433
and even a very practical proposal, set free Marvin Barghouti and so on.

926
01:03:34,266 --> 01:03:38,233
Where are we when, if you say in

927
01:03:38,233 --> 01:03:41,533
Germany, what, an ex-cap or a chief

928
01:03:41,566 --> 01:03:46,200
of Shin Bet I think, you are almost arrested if you say this in German.

929
01:03:46,766 --> 01:03:49,933
So it's not just, you know, one thing is to

930
01:03:49,966 --> 01:03:53,133
say things in places like this one and so on.

931
01:03:53,666 --> 01:03:57,433
At this point, the struggle is effective and it's not a

932
01:03:57,466 --> 01:04:03,600
lost struggle to gradually change the public perception.

933
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,433
I want to just pick up on, you didn't answer

934
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,233
the question about the moral recipe for you.

935
01:04:08,266 --> 01:04:09,266
I never answered the question.

936
01:04:09,466 --> 01:04:10,233
Well, I'll move on then.

937
01:04:10,266 --> 01:04:14,733
I wonder if you will just say a little about how you account for

938
01:04:14,766 --> 01:04:19,666
the fact that in your essay you chronicle and document so carefully

939
01:04:19,733 --> 01:04:30,966
every single instance of Hamas being willing to engage and willing to

940
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:40,200
indicate its efforts to be moderate or to engage in a peace process

941
01:04:41,233 --> 01:04:44,766
And yet the narrative that most people, the majority

942
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:48,166
of people who are looking at what is happening,

943
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,300
the narrative that they absorb is the exact opposite as

944
01:04:53,366 --> 01:04:57,200
framed by Western governments and Israel in particular.

945
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,966
How do you account for that, that lack of knowledge

946
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,666
of the very detailed chronicle that you set out?

947
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,666
Noam Chomsky wrote a book about it, Manufacturing Consent.

948
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:16,200
The fact that the Western media in general is

949
01:05:16,266 --> 01:05:20,166
beholden to the interests of mega corporations,

950
01:05:21,366 --> 01:05:26,066
has a vested interest in repeating the dogmas of the American

951
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:30,466
state, and for that reason are

952
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:34,433
uninterested in telling Americans

953
01:05:34,466 --> 01:05:37,466
and Westerners more broadly the truth about what Israel has done

954
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,500
to Gaza, not just since October 7th, but repeatedly before that.

955
01:05:40,966 --> 01:05:44,500
I can give one example, Operation Cast Lead.

956
01:05:45,866 --> 01:05:51,733
The media narrative about Operation Cast Lead was generally

957
01:05:51,766 --> 01:05:57,633
one that depicted Israel responding to Hamas rocket fire

958
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:01,100
in an act of self-defense, but in fact Operation Cast Lead

959
01:06:01,133 --> 01:06:04,533
was the product of an Israeli violation of a ceasefire.

960
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:12,033
Ceasefire had been signed in June of 2008, and Israeli officials readily

961
01:06:12,066 --> 01:06:16,333
admitted that the Hamas militants carefully adhered to that ceasefire and

962
01:06:16,366 --> 01:06:22,633
that it brought, I'm quoting an Israeli defense official now, brought a

963
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:25,833
large measure of peace and quiet to the

964
01:06:25,866 --> 01:06:29,000
Israeli communities surrounding Gaza.

965
01:06:30,533 --> 01:06:33,266
The deal in that ceasefire was meant to

966
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:36,066
be that Hamas would cease firing rockets,

967
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:40,466
which it did, and Israel was going to lift its illegal and crushing blockade.

968
01:06:41,366 --> 01:06:41,866
It did not.

969
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:43,366
It barely eased it.

970
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,766
And on November 4th, as Norman's documented

971
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,166
this in the most detail, but on November 4th,

972
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:53,600
while Americans were transfixed by their presidential election,

973
01:06:53,633 --> 01:06:58,866
Israel conducts a raid into Gaza, kills six Palestinian militants.

974
01:06:59,466 --> 01:07:04,533
And at that point, the rockets begin to fly and Israel begins bombing Gaza.

975
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:08,366
On December 19th, the ceasefire, it was a six

976
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,966
month ceasefire agreement, the ceasefire expires.

977
01:07:13,066 --> 01:07:16,400
And within days Hamas offers, both through

978
01:07:16,433 --> 01:07:20,266
somebody associated with the Carter Center as

979
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:23,900
well as European governments like Norway and

980
01:07:23,933 --> 01:07:27,533
through the United Nations, offers Israel

981
01:07:28,066 --> 01:07:30,200
a return to that same ceasefire, the one the Palestinians

982
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:34,900
were upholding and that Israel incessantly violated.

983
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:40,400
Two days later, on December 21st, the Israeli

984
01:07:40,433 --> 01:07:44,500
cabinet met and decided it was going to bomb

985
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,266
Gaza and launch a major operation there.

986
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:51,166
In fact, they've been planning it for years, ever since 2006.

987
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:56,700
They were humiliated by Hezbollah in Lebanon.

988
01:07:58,333 --> 01:08:02,300
But not only do they decide that they're

989
01:08:02,366 --> 01:08:07,066
going to start bombing Gaza at that December

990
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:11,966
21st cabinet meeting, they also decide to lie about when they're going to begin bombing.

991
01:08:13,433 --> 01:08:16,600
Tippi Livni meets with the Egyptian president

992
01:08:16,633 --> 01:08:19,800
at the time, Mubarak, and lets him know that

993
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,600
it will not be until the Sunday, December 28th, that Israel will make a

994
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:30,066
decision about what it's going to do about the escalating situation in Gaza.

995
01:08:31,066 --> 01:08:34,566
On December 27th, at 1130 a.m.

996
01:08:34,566 --> 01:08:41,066
in the morning, Israel drops 100 tons of bombs on little Gaza.

997
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,766
It kills, according to human rights organizations,

998
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:48,966
up to 300 Palestinians in the space of minutes.

999
01:08:49,766 --> 01:08:53,466
If October 7th, yes, was the bloodiest day in

1000
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:57,200
the history of the Israel-Palestine conflict,

1001
01:08:58,833 --> 01:09:01,166
certainly the beginning of Operation

1002
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,066
Cast Lead were the bloodiest few minutes.

1003
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:10,166
Ehud Barak, the former Israeli prime minister at the time, the

1004
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:13,300
defense minister, boasted that he had killed 350 terrorists

1005
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,633
within the space of a few minutes at the opening of Cast Lead.

1006
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,400
And of course, Israel then went on to carry

1007
01:09:21,433 --> 01:09:23,833
out what Amnesty International called 22 days

1008
01:09:24,966 --> 01:09:26,866
of death and destruction in Gaza, killing some

1009
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:30,733
1,400 Palestinians, probably 80% of them civilians.

1010
01:09:33,933 --> 01:09:37,066
So when you hear talk, for example,

1011
01:09:37,566 --> 01:09:42,466
about October 7th, people saying that Hamas must be destroyed

1012
01:09:42,533 --> 01:09:48,333
because it violated a ceasefire and committed this horrible atrocity.

1013
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:52,366
I don't see any reason why that same argument

1014
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,466
couldn't be applied to Israel and what it

1015
01:09:55,533 --> 01:09:57,400
did at the beginning of Cast Lead, and not

1016
01:09:57,433 --> 01:09:59,300
just Cast Lead, but again in 2012, Operation

1017
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:08,133
pillar of defense, and then Operation – sorry, in 2014 once more.

1018
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,900
I want to just pick up on a few of the

1019
01:10:12,966 --> 01:10:15,600
threads of comments that we've heard so far.

1020
01:10:17,133 --> 01:10:22,100
Really just to try and examine – and I won't bring you in, Muin,

1021
01:10:22,133 --> 01:10:25,233
here – the relationship between governments and the people.

1022
01:10:25,466 --> 01:10:28,100
So in the Middle East, it seems to me that

1023
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:35,433
whatever machinations go on with autocratic

1024
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,500
States in the Gulf and, you know, absolute

1025
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:39,866
monarchies and so on, the relationship between

1026
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,200
those states and governments and the West is

1027
01:10:43,266 --> 01:10:45,866
so far removed from the Arab in the street

1028
01:10:45,933 --> 01:10:49,966
and not the Arab in the street and the need

1029
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,033
for those governments and states to get the

1030
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:58,433
balance right between what Arabs feel about

1031
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,600
Palestinians and Palestine and what might

1032
01:11:02,033 --> 01:11:06,533
suit those in power yes and I mean we're

1033
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:11,066
often told we're often told thank you

1034
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:24,266
we're often told there is no democracy in the Arab world because of some

1035
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:30,233
backward culture, backward religion, backwardness, and sideways that.

1036
01:11:32,066 --> 01:11:33,833
Well, let's take an example.

1037
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:37,300
Palestinians, you don't even need to go to the Arab world.

1038
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:46,266
You have a Palestinian authority which is propped up and supported by the

1039
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:51,833
West in an inverse relationship to its legitimacy among its own people.

1040
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,200
It seems the more credibility and legitimacy

1041
01:11:55,233 --> 01:11:58,033
loses among its own people, the greater the

1042
01:11:58,066 --> 01:12:01,700
support it gets from Western... it's literally

1043
01:12:01,733 --> 01:12:08,033
being propped up by Israel and the West.

1044
01:12:08,066 --> 01:12:15,966
Of course, you know, those aren't the only reasons for the absence of

1045
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,100
democracy in the Arab world, but they are absolutely central to any analysis.

1046
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:25,600
And to say, oh, Arabs just want to blame the West for their own ills.

1047
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,533
Again, look at the Palestinian example.

1048
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:32,000
In 2006, the Palestinians held an election

1049
01:12:32,766 --> 01:12:37,333
that was certified by the Carter Center as, I believe,

1050
01:12:37,966 --> 01:12:40,400
not only entirely free and fair, but I think as the most free

1051
01:12:40,433 --> 01:12:47,833
and fair of all elections that the Carter Center had monitored.

1052
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:53,000
Well, whatever one may think of Hamas, Hamas

1053
01:12:53,033 --> 01:12:57,133
won that fair and square, and the Western

1054
01:12:57,166 --> 01:12:59,333
reaction was to put in place a process of

1055
01:12:59,366 --> 01:13:02,033
blockade, of demonization, of delegitimization,

1056
01:13:02,066 --> 01:13:04,800
of repeated military onslaughts on the Gaza

1057
01:13:04,833 --> 01:13:07,566
Strip that led precisely to the genocidal

1058
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:13,233
Assault on the Palestinians of the

1059
01:13:13,266 --> 01:13:18,900
Gaza Strip that we are experiencing today

1060
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:22,566
So don't come to me with stories about the

1061
01:13:22,633 --> 01:13:25,366
West is looking for a democratic partner

1062
01:13:26,233 --> 01:13:29,600
Whenever there's been an inkling of a democratic partner.

1063
01:13:29,633 --> 01:13:30,733
He's been eliminated.

1064
01:13:30,733 --> 01:13:34,233
I Just want to read from from Coulter's essay where he

1065
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:38,633
quotes on the Hillary Clinton when she was a senator

1066
01:13:39,066 --> 01:13:41,533
If we were going to push for an election and we should

1067
01:13:41,566 --> 01:13:43,933
have made sure to determine who was going to win.

1068
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:45,366
Precise six.

1069
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:50,900
I wanted to just take up where Walter and Mooin left off.

1070
01:13:59,166 --> 01:14:01,966
In my opinion, and obviously we can disagree on it,

1071
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:06,566
that when you pass moral judgments on other people's actions,

1072
01:14:08,033 --> 01:14:14,100
In my opinion, you have to also examine what were the options

1073
01:14:14,133 --> 01:14:17,166
available in the context of the decisions that were made.

1074
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:27,200
Now, as Muin pointed out, a brutal blockade was imposed on Gaza.

1075
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:31,400
It really began around 1991, it was called

1076
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:35,033
a closure, and then it was ratcheted up with

1077
01:14:35,366 --> 01:14:38,100
the election in 2006 when Hamas won,

1078
01:14:38,133 --> 01:14:41,400
and then was ratcheted up again in 2007.

1079
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:49,900
And at that point a process began which, because of the brutality of the

1080
01:14:49,933 --> 01:14:57,700
blockade, turned Gaza into what the economists called a human rubbish heap.

1081
01:14:58,266 --> 01:15:00,233
Now, it was Gaza, 2 million people, 70% of

1082
01:15:00,266 --> 01:15:03,400
them refugees from 1948 and their descendants,

1083
01:15:06,833 --> 01:15:09,733
half of them children, a million, more than

1084
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,700
a million children, and they had been reduced

1085
01:15:13,666 --> 01:15:17,200
as a consequence of that blockade into, to

1086
01:15:17,233 --> 01:15:20,766
repeat the expression, a human rubbish heap.

1087
01:15:22,566 --> 01:15:27,800
That's the context, as you might call it, the socio-economic context.

1088
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,400
And nobody can go in and nobody can come out.

1089
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:38,300
Most of the young people who burst the gates

1090
01:15:38,366 --> 01:15:41,200
of Gaza on October 7th were born into that

1091
01:15:41,266 --> 01:15:44,333
rubbish heap, were living in that rubbish

1092
01:15:44,366 --> 01:15:47,433
heap, and as things looked on October 6th,

1093
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,766
They were going to die in that rubbish.

1094
01:15:53,433 --> 01:15:55,466
That's the socioeconomic context.

1095
01:15:56,566 --> 01:16:00,000
Now Coulter fills in the political context.

1096
01:16:01,266 --> 01:16:04,900
In that period, on numerous occasions, Hamas

1097
01:16:04,933 --> 01:16:09,333
attempted a diplomatic resolution of the conflict.

1098
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:11,966
Were their proposals perfect?

1099
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:12,300
No.

1100
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,933
Would they have required a lot of intense

1101
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,400
negotiation to achieve a settlement?

1102
01:16:18,766 --> 01:16:23,066
In my opinion, yes, but there were certainly reasonable proposals

1103
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:27,400
and they were a basis to try to solve the conflict diplomatically.

1104
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:32,500
All of those diplomatic proposals were perectorally

1105
01:16:32,533 --> 01:16:36,966
dismissed and they weren't even acknowledged as proposals.

1106
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,233
So now, what options are left for the Palestinians?

1107
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,400
There was an option, which I embarrassingly have to acknowledge,

1108
01:16:47,433 --> 01:16:52,833
I was the one promoting in all of my talks for several years.

1109
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:58,666
I thought the possibility, the option of nonviolent civil resistance could work.

1110
01:17:00,566 --> 01:17:05,633
And on March 30, 2018, it was a popular initiative, it

1111
01:17:05,666 --> 01:17:08,933
did not start with Hamas, it was a popular Initiative,

1112
01:17:08,966 --> 01:17:11,233
they tried the Nonviolent Civil Resistance March of

1113
01:17:11,266 --> 01:17:17,333
Return, what was called, yes, the Great March of Return.

1114
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:20,600
And as there was a very good UN report,

1115
01:17:20,633 --> 01:17:23,766
it runs to 250 single-spaced pages.

1116
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,733
It's a very exhaustive, even by the UN

1117
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:28,066
standards, it was a remarkably exhaustive,

1118
01:17:28,466 --> 01:17:32,000
wasn't as large as the Goldstone Report, but it was a very significant report.

1119
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,300
And it was a remarkably detailed report.

1120
01:17:41,766 --> 01:17:45,433
A large chunk of that report is given over to describing what

1121
01:17:45,466 --> 01:17:51,600
happened to those marchers in the Great March of Returns.

1122
01:17:54,766 --> 01:17:58,266
Just to give the salient facts, number one, they

1123
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:02,600
describe the march as beginning as people will remember.

1124
01:18:02,633 --> 01:18:05,100
It began as a festive occasion.

1125
01:18:05,133 --> 01:18:12,700
There was singing, there was dancing, there were circus-like performances.

1126
01:18:12,733 --> 01:18:19,966
People were very enthusiastic about this prospect possibility and potentiality.

1127
01:18:19,966 --> 01:18:22,266
What did Israel do?

1128
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:26,366
It lined up its best snipers,

1129
01:18:28,366 --> 01:18:32,233
It's the best snipers along the perimeter with Gaza.

1130
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:38,433
And then the report with a lot of detail,

1131
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:41,833
it goes through what those snipers did.

1132
01:18:42,766 --> 01:18:47,200
They quote the Israeli government as saying,

1133
01:18:47,233 --> 01:18:52,600
every bullet landed where it was intended to land.

1134
01:18:54,100 --> 01:19:00,033
There's no question here of like WCK mistakes, errors.

1135
01:19:02,466 --> 01:19:05,800
Every bullet landed where it was intended to land, okay?

1136
01:19:08,033 --> 01:19:13,600
So the report says Israel targeted the snipers

1137
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:19,233
methodically, systematically, premeditatedly,

1138
01:19:19,833 --> 01:19:27,300
it targeted children, it targeted medics,

1139
01:19:27,333 --> 01:19:34,800
it targeted journalists, and it targeted

1140
01:19:35,433 --> 01:19:42,066
disabled people, it targeted double

1141
01:19:42,133 --> 01:19:46,333
amputees, it targeted people in wheelchairs.

1142
01:19:46,333 --> 01:19:52,500
He targeted people on crutches who were

1143
01:19:52,533 --> 01:19:58,700
300 meters away from the perimeter fence.

1144
01:19:58,733 --> 01:20:06,366
Now anybody who understands anything about non-violence knows as a

1145
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:15,233
method of struggle, it can only work if it evokes or elicits our reaction

1146
01:20:16,066 --> 01:20:20,866
from bystanders, from non-participants,

1147
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:27,400
either as perpetrators or victims.

1148
01:20:28,166 --> 01:20:32,733
The whole point of Martin Luther King's nonviolent

1149
01:20:32,766 --> 01:20:39,333
campaign was, he said that we can evoke sympathy,

1150
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:45,966
action from the federal government, from the North, if

1151
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:52,400
we exhibit the violence that's entrenched in this system.

1152
01:20:53,233 --> 01:20:57,433
The only way you can exhibit the violence entrenched

1153
01:20:57,466 --> 01:21:00,666
in this system is you have to go out and demonstrate.

1154
01:21:01,466 --> 01:21:06,400
They will come out with their dogs, they will come out with their fire hoses,

1155
01:21:06,433 --> 01:21:08,633
sometimes they will come out with their

1156
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:11,400
guns, and then people are supposed to react.

1157
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,733
If our federal government did not react, if the

1158
01:21:16,766 --> 01:21:21,233
North did not react, then everybody would just die.

1159
01:21:22,766 --> 01:21:25,766
non-violence is a dead end.

1160
01:21:25,766 --> 01:21:29,700
And the fact that as Israel targeted children,

1161
01:21:29,733 --> 01:21:34,766
medics, journalists, disabled people, nobody reacted.

1162
01:21:34,766 --> 01:21:40,900
I have to acknowledge not even the Palestine Solidarity Movement reacted.

1163
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:45,766
So I have to embarrassingly say I was shamefaced after that

1164
01:21:45,833 --> 01:21:50,700
because I had been in touch with some people in in some positions.

1165
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,233
I was the one that was counseling it,

1166
01:21:54,166 --> 01:21:57,000
and it was a complete and total failure.

1167
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,966
And so I say, we come to October 6th, the night.

1168
01:22:06,366 --> 01:22:08,333
Diplomacy, it doesn't work.

1169
01:22:09,766 --> 01:22:13,466
Nonviolent civil resistance, it doesn't work.

1170
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,666
I'm willing to accept what Muin says because

1171
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,566
he's much more knowledgeable than me.

1172
01:22:19,266 --> 01:22:22,466
He said the Saudi deal was not really going to happen, but I'm

1173
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:27,333
sure Moin will agree with me, many people thought it would happen.

1174
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,366
And so they thought this whole Arab-Israeli

1175
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,966
conflict was going to be solved above the

1176
01:22:36,366 --> 01:22:38,666
heads of the people of Gaza.

1177
01:22:40,533 --> 01:22:43,200
That it would be happily ever after between

1178
01:22:43,266 --> 01:22:45,933
the Gulf states, Saudi, Israel, the United

1179
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:50,733
States and the people of Gaza, they were going

1180
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:55,333
to languish and die in that concentration camp.

1181
01:22:56,066 --> 01:22:58,200
That was their fate and their future.

1182
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:08,066
And unless somebody can present to me what options did

1183
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:14,566
they not exploit, what choices did they have at that point.

1184
01:23:15,766 --> 01:23:20,533
I for one, recognizing that atrocities of a

1185
01:23:20,566 --> 01:23:26,033
significant magnitude occurred on October 7th,

1186
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:37,233
I for one find it very difficult to condemn what happened

1187
01:23:37,266 --> 01:23:42,166
on October 7th even as I recognize atrocities occur.

1188
01:23:43,966 --> 01:23:46,300
Okay, a moment then just to,

1189
01:23:46,666 --> 01:23:51,700
because we've got about 20 minutes, I think, to open it up to

1190
01:23:51,733 --> 01:23:54,766
the floor and I'll give you the chance, Slavoj, to respond.

1191
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,766
I can't really see the lights on us,

1192
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:00,900
but yes, I can, if you put hands up, that would be great.

1193
01:24:02,233 --> 01:24:03,800
Yes, no, you're so shy.

1194
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:06,333
Is that one right back here?

1195
01:24:06,866 --> 01:24:07,366
Can you stand up?

1196
01:24:07,933 --> 01:24:08,666
Sure.

1197
01:24:10,566 --> 01:24:11,566
Sorry, is there somebody?

1198
01:24:11,766 --> 01:24:12,600
Yeah, please stand up.

1199
01:24:12,733 --> 01:24:13,500
Is there a microphone?

1200
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:14,333
Do you have a microphone?

1201
01:24:14,366 --> 01:24:14,866
Does it matter?

1202
01:24:15,566 --> 01:24:16,966
I think if you talk about it.

1203
01:24:17,766 --> 01:24:18,300
Hi, thank you.

1204
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:23,000
I want to go back to the question of the politics in Israel.

1205
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,200
So you talked about there's the right, the center right, the far right.

1206
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:31,066
I mean, we are also seeing this sort of

1207
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:33,900
protest movement growing against Netanyahu

1208
01:24:33,933 --> 01:24:35,600
to get the hostages home that is not

1209
01:24:35,633 --> 01:24:37,766
talking a whole lot about the Palestinians.

1210
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:40,333
And you know, I think at all.

1211
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:42,100
If at all, right.

1212
01:24:43,166 --> 01:24:50,333
And I guess my question is, if we assume that the global movement

1213
01:24:50,366 --> 01:24:55,466
in support of Palestine continues to grow, and the movement

1214
01:24:55,533 --> 01:24:58,500
inside of Israel, maybe it grows in its way, but in a way that

1215
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:03,200
is really to sort of calcify a less far-right version of Israel.

1216
01:25:05,066 --> 01:25:06,033
What do you do about that?

1217
01:25:06,466 --> 01:25:11,600
What do you do about this population of, seven million people in Israel,

1218
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:17,033
who seem to just be refused to accept

1219
01:25:17,633 --> 01:25:20,100
that there was something fundamentally

1220
01:25:20,166 --> 01:25:23,066
oppressive and wrong about their society?

1221
01:25:24,566 --> 01:25:26,266
Is that directed at anyone in particular?

1222
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,500
I mean, I was thinking, Norman, I'd love

1223
01:25:27,533 --> 01:25:29,900
to hear your thoughts and whoever else.

1224
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:30,433
Of course.

1225
01:25:31,433 --> 01:25:32,966
I'd rather hear from moving first.

1226
01:25:37,533 --> 01:25:41,833
Well, I think the problem with this society

1227
01:25:42,766 --> 01:25:49,966
is you can think of it as a spoiled child that runs them up in a porcelain store.

1228
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:53,600
And the store owner, instead of demanding

1229
01:25:53,633 --> 01:25:56,500
that the parents pay the price of the broken

1230
01:25:56,533 --> 01:25:59,700
porcelain starts telling the parents what a cute

1231
01:25:59,733 --> 01:26:02,900
kid it is and can you please break some more.

1232
01:26:04,933 --> 01:26:11,066
I think Israeli society at one level we need to show a bit of understanding.

1233
01:26:12,266 --> 01:26:16,800
If you've been allowed to get away with

1234
01:26:16,833 --> 01:26:21,366
everything for so long and if total impunity

1235
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:27,800
is the default setting, you can't really expect this society to act differently.

1236
01:26:27,833 --> 01:26:32,733
People talk about how small the peace movement in

1237
01:26:32,766 --> 01:26:37,666
Israel was, and it isn't infinitesimally small,

1238
01:26:37,666 --> 01:26:41,233
but in a sense it's a miracle there's one at all,

1239
01:26:41,266 --> 01:26:44,833
given the nature of this society in relation to its

1240
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:47,833
Western sponsors and the absolute

1241
01:26:47,866 --> 01:26:52,066
impunity it enjoys for anything and

1242
01:26:52,066 --> 01:26:54,433
everything it does towards the Palestinian people, including genocide.

1243
01:26:55,266 --> 01:27:03,233
Even that is being actively supported by the West.

1244
01:27:03,566 --> 01:27:06,433
So in terms of these protests you're talking

1245
01:27:06,466 --> 01:27:09,333
about, you know, you had a very large

1246
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,933
protest movement before October 7th against

1247
01:27:11,933 --> 01:27:14,466
the Netanyahu government's legislative agenda.

1248
01:27:16,066 --> 01:27:16,833
The judicial reforms?

1249
01:27:17,366 --> 01:27:19,000
Yes, the so-called judicial reforms.

1250
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,866
The leaders of that process movement

1251
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:26,266
were actively keeping any discussion of

1252
01:27:26,333 --> 01:27:28,533
Israeli-Palestinian relations, to use that

1253
01:27:28,566 --> 01:27:30,766
euphemism, out of the protest movement.

1254
01:27:32,133 --> 01:27:39,400
And now, it's simply about protesting against the government

1255
01:27:39,433 --> 01:27:42,266
to cut a deal with Hamas so that the captives are released.

1256
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:45,466
But other than that, to the best of my understanding,

1257
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,766
it really doesn't have a political agenda

1258
01:27:48,466 --> 01:27:52,200
in terms of changing the nature of Israeli-Palestinian relations.

1259
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:57,700
So if you want to change Israeli society, don't look at Israel.

1260
01:27:58,666 --> 01:28:01,633
Look at those who are enabling Israel.

1261
01:28:01,633 --> 01:28:05,066
And those who have taught Israeli society that

1262
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:07,200
anything goes up to and including genocide,

1263
01:28:07,766 --> 01:28:11,066
that there will never be accountability, that impunity is a

1264
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:14,400
default, so that's really what the fundamental problem is.

1265
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:18,466
Isn't there also an issue with what you were

1266
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:21,900
talking about earlier Norman, the Chuck Schumer

1267
01:28:21,966 --> 01:28:24,666
comments, this perception that seems to be

1268
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:27,400
prevailing, that if Netanyahu was the person

1269
01:28:27,733 --> 01:28:31,000
that was gotten rid of, then things would be better,

1270
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:36,633
without taking into account the kind of entrenched structural views

1271
01:28:37,066 --> 01:28:40,433
and consciousness and psychology that prevails in Israel.

1272
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:45,333
There are a number of comments to make.

1273
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:50,333
First of all, I totally agree with you, it's not

1274
01:28:50,366 --> 01:28:53,033
Netanyahu's war any more than it's Putin's war.

1275
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:57,433
It's a consensus across the elites in the

1276
01:28:57,466 --> 01:29:00,866
case of both, and it's not just Netanyahu.

1277
01:29:03,833 --> 01:29:07,366
In the case of Israel, I'll speak reluctantly about

1278
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,866
Russia because I don't know the popular sentiment.

1279
01:29:10,433 --> 01:29:12,000
In the case of Russia, it's the whole of, excuse

1280
01:29:12,033 --> 01:29:14,200
me, the case of Israel is the entire society.

1281
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:16,966
If you look at the polling data, roughly 90

1282
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,333
percent of Israelis believe, or 88 percent

1283
01:29:21,166 --> 01:29:25,666
believe that Israel is using enough force or insufficient

1284
01:29:25,666 --> 01:29:30,833
force, about 40 percent believe Israel is using

1285
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:33,566
insufficient force in Gaza, there's about 12 percent

1286
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,266
who have second thoughts about what Israel is doing.

1287
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:39,200
So I don't think, I agree with you, I don't

1288
01:29:39,266 --> 01:29:41,200
think it's correct to describe it as say

1289
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:44,733
Netanyahu's war and I don't think Senator

1290
01:29:44,766 --> 01:29:48,133
Schumer was accurate as if to say there were

1291
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,700
an election, somebody better, maybe a Gantz,

1292
01:29:50,733 --> 01:29:53,066
who campaigned when he ran for office.

1293
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:56,400
He campaigned on the destruction he wreaked on Gaza in 2014.

1294
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,633
That was his campaign video.

1295
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:04,700
So I can't say I'm optimistic on that score,

1296
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:10,433
that it's just Netanyahu and a handful of others.

1297
01:30:11,466 --> 01:30:16,600
I would say, and I don't say this happily, I think it's pointless to try to change

1298
01:30:16,966 --> 01:30:19,933
the attitudes of Israelis now, just as it was

1299
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,966
pointless during the civil rights movement

1300
01:30:23,433 --> 01:30:27,066
to try to change the attitudes of whites in the South.

1301
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:32,166
It required external force up to and including the

1302
01:30:32,233 --> 01:30:37,300
introduction of federal troops to desegregate the South.

1303
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:40,233
There were a handful of people in the South, whites,

1304
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:42,966
who had second thoughts about what was going on.

1305
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:46,300
honestly opposed to it, but it was a tiny handful.

1306
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:51,233
I don't believe you can expect, for all the

1307
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:55,133
reasons that Maureen described, he left out

1308
01:30:55,166 --> 01:30:59,966
the ideological aspects of it, a very lethal

1309
01:31:00,033 --> 01:31:05,800
combination of notions of Jewish inferiority

1310
01:31:06,333 --> 01:31:11,766
and our inferiority—actually, our animality,

1311
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:15,033
not inferiority—and there are all these

1312
01:31:16,933 --> 01:31:20,966
different levels of ideological, what's just called, ugliness,

1313
01:31:21,033 --> 01:31:26,333
that make it very hard to transform as early as it's decided.

1314
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:29,533
I'll have to say, because I want to be fair

1315
01:31:29,566 --> 01:31:32,000
about these things, you could say the two,

1316
01:31:32,466 --> 01:31:37,666
In the very ugly history of the 20th century, you could

1317
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:41,233
say the two most racist and imperialist countries in God's

1318
01:31:41,266 --> 01:31:43,066
earth were Germany and

1319
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,533
Japan in the 1930s, and the kinds of crimes

1320
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:51,700
they committed during World War II were just total abominations.

1321
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:54,000
We all know about the Germans once when the

1322
01:31:54,033 --> 01:31:57,166
Japanese killed about 26 million Chinese.

1323
01:31:57,666 --> 01:32:02,633
It was a very ugly, ugly war by the Japanese in Asia.

1324
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:11,500
But countries changed, Germany did change, Japan did change.

1325
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:15,266
So I don't believe in these notions of original sin.

1326
01:32:16,666 --> 01:32:23,933
But I do agree, I've come to agree with Maureen, that

1327
01:32:23,966 --> 01:32:31,233
a serious revamping of Israeli society is necessary.

1328
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:37,100
How that occurs, how it unfolds, I can't say.

1329
01:32:37,966 --> 01:32:41,700
But it's just really, it's such an ugly

1330
01:32:41,733 --> 01:32:46,333
place now, and has been for a very long time.

1331
01:32:47,266 --> 01:32:49,866
And I'll admit to something, you know, when

1332
01:32:49,933 --> 01:32:52,533
I'm reading the coverage now, the coverage

1333
01:32:52,866 --> 01:32:58,400
now, now, against Israel, it's really horrible.

1334
01:33:00,433 --> 01:33:02,900
The positions, it's put itself.

1335
01:33:04,433 --> 01:33:11,900
The position it's put itself, that being by nature I always support the

1336
01:33:11,966 --> 01:33:19,433
underdog, I almost feel sorry for what it did to itself, because it's horrible.

1337
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:24,600
And these folks, they don't even see it, what they've done.

1338
01:33:25,466 --> 01:33:27,100
It's like a statement to an abortion.

1339
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:31,166
And maybe the whole idea was wrong from the

1340
01:33:31,233 --> 01:33:34,366
beginning and maybe it was wrong at the beginning

1341
01:33:34,633 --> 01:33:37,633
But, there was a lot of things wrong with America at the beginning.

1342
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:42,366
The U.S. figured out a way, not to make it a great

1343
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:49,066
place, and it did require the extermination of the native

1344
01:33:49,133 --> 01:33:52,466
population, you can't forget that, but the U.S. seemed

1345
01:33:52,466 --> 01:33:55,800
to have some capacity, some capacity for self-reform.

1346
01:33:56,733 --> 01:34:01,966
And I don't know what Israel does.

1347
01:34:02,933 --> 01:34:04,533
Let's take some more questions.

1348
01:34:05,433 --> 01:34:05,833
I'm sure.

1349
01:34:06,766 --> 01:34:08,833
There's a hand stuck there at the back.

1350
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:12,300
Yeah, I actually just want to follow up on that.

1351
01:34:12,533 --> 01:34:15,633
I mean, so like, Ilan Pompeii talks about the

1352
01:34:15,666 --> 01:34:18,766
Israel of Tel Aviv and Israel of the Central.

1353
01:34:19,666 --> 01:34:22,000
I mean, Israel is a very unified

1354
01:34:22,033 --> 01:34:24,366
society when it comes to Palestine,

1355
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:27,633
but it is internally an extremely polarized society.

1356
01:34:28,666 --> 01:34:31,800
Israelis perceive themselves as living in a highly polarized society.

1357
01:34:33,133 --> 01:34:36,233
And I think one of the things if you know

1358
01:34:36,266 --> 01:34:39,366
Israelis, and you know Israelis that are in

1359
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:42,500
Israel of Tel Aviv, that you'll hear since

1360
01:34:42,533 --> 01:34:45,633
October 7, particularly, but really 2023,

1361
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:51,033
I mean, there was this idea in the Israel of Tel Aviv that, you know, we

1362
01:34:51,066 --> 01:34:56,600
can sort of of marginal, like we don't have to resolve the question of

1363
01:34:56,633 --> 01:35:01,666
Palestine and we can just sort of continue living in what feels like a

1364
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:05,700
normal society where we can go to cafes in Tel Aviv and eat croissants.

1365
01:35:08,266 --> 01:35:12,433
And 2023, first with the crisis, as they call it,

1366
01:35:12,466 --> 01:35:15,400
the crisis of democracy, and then with October 7th,

1367
01:35:16,266 --> 01:35:20,566
there's a massive, across the Israel of Tel Aviv,

1368
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:29,000
disinvestment in the in the future of living in Israel.

1369
01:35:29,033 --> 01:35:34,500
So many people all of a sudden talking about there's no future here, we're

1370
01:35:34,533 --> 01:35:38,566
we're gonna live under constant threat of violence from Hamas, from Tikalah,

1371
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:46,100
from Iran, and these were the people that were sort of the ambassadors to

1372
01:35:46,133 --> 01:35:51,300
the worlds of the sort of and humane, liberal, enlightened Israel, right?

1373
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,933
I mean, these were the sort of educated

1374
01:35:53,966 --> 01:35:56,966
professionals and intellectuals who went to

1375
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,400
their conferences and presented themselves

1376
01:35:59,466 --> 01:36:02,566
as living in a normal nation among nations.

1377
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:09,066
And there's a massive sort of movement among those

1378
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:13,266
people of disinvestment in the national project.

1379
01:36:15,633 --> 01:36:20,166
And many people who just talk about leaving, actually get a lot

1380
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:24,733
of people who talk about moving back to Europe well it started

1381
01:36:24,766 --> 01:36:28,933
to happen as well it was there a specific question I mean the

1382
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,166
comments are really really interesting yeah yeah so the question

1383
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,333
is just do you perceive that as a major factor because I know

1384
01:36:35,366 --> 01:36:41,800
people say I mean Israeli society is beyond reform when it comes

1385
01:36:41,866 --> 01:36:44,866
to the question of the Palestinians but do you You perceive that

1386
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:47,833
as a significant moving part in, yeah, events going forward.

1387
01:36:48,533 --> 01:36:49,700
Sir, do you want to take that one?

1388
01:36:50,566 --> 01:36:53,133
No, I want to go into a different direction.

1389
01:36:53,566 --> 01:36:53,833
Okay.

1390
01:36:54,466 --> 01:36:55,466
Can I just answer very briefly?

1391
01:36:55,566 --> 01:36:56,266
Go ahead, please.

1392
01:36:56,600 --> 01:37:03,566
Which is to say that I won't pretend to know more about this issue

1393
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:07,433
than you do, and assuming that your observations are correct,

1394
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:12,666
I think that makes the problem even more complicated

1395
01:37:13,433 --> 01:37:17,900
than was made out to be, because that would be the capacity for self-reform.

1396
01:37:19,966 --> 01:37:20,800
Simply doesn't exist.

1397
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:25,300
I see other hands going off.

1398
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:30,033
Just a question to anyone in the panel.

1399
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:34,500
How likely do you think that this conflict will spread

1400
01:37:34,533 --> 01:37:38,833
in the region that other actors might get involved?

1401
01:37:39,266 --> 01:37:45,400
And does Israel have an interest in bringing, in enlarging this conflict?

1402
01:37:46,133 --> 01:37:47,900
Muhyin, you've referred to that in your MC.

1403
01:37:48,166 --> 01:37:49,100
Can you repeat the question?

1404
01:37:49,466 --> 01:37:50,133
Yeah, of course.

1405
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:56,066
Is it in Israel's interest to escalate the war regionally?

1406
01:37:56,833 --> 01:37:58,966
And how likely is it that that might happen?

1407
01:37:59,733 --> 01:38:04,833
I think Israel would like to escalate conflict regionally because

1408
01:38:04,866 --> 01:38:11,000
it sees an opportunity to draw the U.S. directly into its conflict

1409
01:38:11,566 --> 01:38:16,900
with its adversaries and in an ideal situation, from Israel's

1410
01:38:16,933 --> 01:38:22,266
perspective, to provoke a direct Iranian-American confrontation.

1411
01:38:22,966 --> 01:38:27,300
Just very briefly, you're familiar with the recent Iranian attack on the

1412
01:38:27,333 --> 01:38:31,666
– sorry, the since Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus.

1413
01:38:32,633 --> 01:38:38,333
And apparently, the Iranians have sent messages to

1414
01:38:38,366 --> 01:38:43,066
the Americans that if the Americans successfully

1415
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:46,333
produce a permanent ceasefire, in other words,

1416
01:38:46,366 --> 01:38:49,466
an end to Israel's war in the Gaza Strip,

1417
01:38:50,333 --> 01:38:53,800
then as far as the Iranians are concerned, the file is closed.

1418
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:58,066
And if the Americans fail, then the Iranians have decided

1419
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:01,500
that in order to deter Israel, they will launch an

1420
01:39:01,533 --> 01:39:05,733
attack directly on Israeli territory, not through one of

1421
01:39:05,766 --> 01:39:12,600
their allied militias, but directly from Iran territory.

1422
01:39:12,733 --> 01:39:15,000
So in other words, if the Americans make

1423
01:39:15,066 --> 01:39:17,333
the choice not to end the war, together

1424
01:39:17,366 --> 01:39:19,200
would be a policy decision, and the

1425
01:39:19,233 --> 01:39:21,400
Iranians follow through on the threat,

1426
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:24,800
that we could be looking at a very major

1427
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:34,333
I just want to reiterate what I said earlier.

1428
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:41,866
If the U.S. imposes a permanent ceasefire

1429
01:39:41,933 --> 01:39:46,533
as the quid pro quo for Iran not taking

1430
01:39:46,566 --> 01:39:51,166
any retaliatory action, the problem is

1431
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:55,000
then Hamas will be able to declare victory.

1432
01:39:56,366 --> 01:39:57,900
And Israel will not accept that.

1433
01:39:58,733 --> 01:40:03,800
Israel is determined to get that absolute, unequivocal,

1434
01:40:03,833 --> 01:40:08,900
total victory and inflict the total defeat on Hamas.

1435
01:40:11,933 --> 01:40:13,500
And there's the second problem.

1436
01:40:14,466 --> 01:40:17,233
Right now, about 100,000 people are displaced

1437
01:40:17,266 --> 01:40:21,433
from northern Israel because of Hezbollah.

1438
01:40:22,566 --> 01:40:25,800
And Israel is not pleased about that fact either.

1439
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:28,866
Will it give Hezbollah a pass?

1440
01:40:30,266 --> 01:40:34,033
I think personally, but we can disagree, he knows

1441
01:40:34,066 --> 01:40:37,833
better than me, personally, I don't believe it.

1442
01:40:37,833 --> 01:40:45,333
And then there's one third problem, the problem that Coulter

1443
01:40:45,366 --> 01:40:49,466
alluded to, it's very easy to break a permanent ceasefire.

1444
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:53,766
You can agree to a permanent ceasefire, Israel can agree

1445
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:56,666
to it, as they did, as Coulter pointed out in June 2008.

1446
01:40:58,566 --> 01:41:01,566
And then when Israel wanted a war, just provoked,

1447
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:04,600
provoked, provoked, then there's the war

1448
01:41:04,633 --> 01:41:07,033
and And everybody forgets who provoked and, as

1449
01:41:07,066 --> 01:41:10,666
Milken claimed, it's acting itself a defence.

1450
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,866
So personally, I don't attach any

1451
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:19,100
significance or value to any declared

1452
01:41:19,166 --> 01:41:20,866
permanent ceasefire because looking at

1453
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,933
the history, it's just very easy to break.

1454
01:41:23,533 --> 01:41:25,500
Can I just ask Colter a question about, just

1455
01:41:25,533 --> 01:41:27,866
picking up from Norman's point, on the declaration

1456
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:29,966
that israel makes time and again to eliminate

1457
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,033
hamas once and for all the the feasibility

1458
01:41:32,066 --> 01:41:35,466
of that because you do refer to that in your

1459
01:41:35,533 --> 01:41:39,433
essay the the fact that hamas is is many things

1460
01:41:39,433 --> 01:41:43,666
the social movement it's a militia there's this

1461
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:47,933
political movement and it's also just an idea

1462
01:41:49,533 --> 01:41:52,833
yeah um the short answer is it's completely

1463
01:41:52,866 --> 01:41:56,800
impossible for israel to eliminate hamas even if

1464
01:41:57,466 --> 01:42:03,466
we were to accept, which I don't, that eliminating Hamas is a

1465
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:11,766
morally unobjectionable, practically it's not going to happen.

1466
01:42:11,766 --> 01:42:15,666
Hamas is not just based in the Gaza Strip, it is based all

1467
01:42:15,733 --> 01:42:19,633
throughout the occupied territories and outside of them.

1468
01:42:19,633 --> 01:42:22,033
And furthermore, even if you can destroy

1469
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:25,000
Hamas's military capabilities.

1470
01:42:25,033 --> 01:42:26,900
Israel claims that it has more or less wiped out Hamas's

1471
01:42:26,933 --> 01:42:32,600
military capabilities in the northern part of the Gaza Strip,

1472
01:42:32,633 --> 01:42:35,200
even if it does invade Rafah and, you know, comes back

1473
01:42:35,233 --> 01:42:40,200
with the severed heads of Sinwar and other Hamas leaders.

1474
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:44,233
What it will not have done is done anything about the

1475
01:42:45,233 --> 01:42:47,833
source of Palestinian grievance, which we've

1476
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:50,466
been talking about, which is so obvious.

1477
01:42:50,466 --> 01:42:54,700
Decades now of occupation, of apartheid, massacre, even if what arises

1478
01:42:54,733 --> 01:43:00,666
out of those ashes doesn't call

1479
01:43:00,733 --> 01:43:03,266
itself Hamas, it'll be the same problem.

1480
01:43:03,266 --> 01:43:05,233
I think we're gonna have to wrap up unless

1481
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:07,666
somebody's got an urgent pressing question that

1482
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:09,333
they, there's a hand going up here, I really

1483
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:11,033
can't see all the way at the back of the room.

1484
01:43:11,066 --> 01:43:12,800
Why don't you take this one here.

1485
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:13,866
I have a question.

1486
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:14,500
Okay.

1487
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:14,633
I was

1488
01:43:14,966 --> 01:43:18,133
I was wondering, in your opinion, why did Nicaragua

1489
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:26,500
bring a case against Germany and not against the

1490
01:43:26,533 --> 01:43:31,966
USA, who seems to be the prime supporter of Israel,

1491
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,466
either with weapons than with financial support?

1492
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:40,633
I think because Nicaragua is in Central America and Germany is in Europe.

1493
01:43:45,333 --> 01:43:46,666
I want to go right to the back of the room.

1494
01:43:46,766 --> 01:43:48,200
Is there a hand that's gone up?

1495
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,466
Not the person who asked about the Tel Aviv

1496
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,233
question, because you've already had a question.

1497
01:43:52,233 --> 01:43:52,633
Sorry, sir.

1498
01:43:55,666 --> 01:43:56,266
In the front, here.

1499
01:43:58,133 --> 01:44:00,400
For any of you, is there any chance of

1500
01:44:00,433 --> 01:44:02,700
that relationship of total impunity,

1501
01:44:03,166 --> 01:44:07,400
of total toleration and support between the United States and Israel.

1502
01:44:07,733 --> 01:44:09,733
I mean, public opinion has changed significantly.

1503
01:44:09,966 --> 01:44:12,800
Is there any chance of that shifting

1504
01:44:12,833 --> 01:44:15,666
in any way, even small, in the future?

1505
01:44:16,033 --> 01:44:17,400
Who wants to say that?

1506
01:44:18,666 --> 01:44:26,700
Well, I think the changes that Norman and others have been talking about

1507
01:44:28,266 --> 01:44:34,900
of profound importance and lonely of profound political importance.

1508
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:38,800
But it's going to take time for them to have an

1509
01:44:38,866 --> 01:44:43,466
impact on the types of questions that you're asking.

1510
01:44:43,466 --> 01:44:46,700
My response to that question, if you're asking about

1511
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:51,700
it in the short term, is Biden, Blinken, Netanyahu,

1512
01:44:52,633 --> 01:44:56,166
of them, they're not going to be held accountable.

1513
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:57,700
They're going to get away with their crimes.

1514
01:44:57,866 --> 01:45:00,800
That's the way the world unfortunately works.

1515
01:45:00,833 --> 01:45:04,700
But having said that, Lincoln's grandchildren,

1516
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:09,866
whenever they want to study the Gaza genocide,

1517
01:45:09,933 --> 01:45:13,066
the 21st century, they will know that any

1518
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:16,733
study of that genocide that doesn't assign a starring

1519
01:45:16,766 --> 01:45:20,100
role to their grandfather is an an incomplete account.

1520
01:45:21,233 --> 01:45:26,000
And unfortunately, I think that's probably the extent of accountability.

1521
01:45:26,266 --> 01:45:28,466
Karim Khan is still decorating his Christmas tree.

1522
01:45:31,066 --> 01:45:32,700
ICC is not gonna get involved.

1523
01:45:33,766 --> 01:45:37,166
The ICJ can take clear decisions,

1524
01:45:37,566 --> 01:45:39,266
but they can't be enforced.

1525
01:45:40,433 --> 01:45:42,900
The way the international system is currently structured,

1526
01:45:43,766 --> 01:45:47,000
there's unfortunately no accountability or

1527
01:45:47,033 --> 01:45:50,266
criminals in the sense that you're asking.

1528
01:45:52,566 --> 01:45:54,633
What a grim note on which to end,

1529
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,300
but we are gonna have to draw it to a close.

1530
01:45:58,366 --> 01:46:00,400
Buy the book and keep talking.

1531
01:46:00,566 --> 01:46:02,866
Thank you very much indeed for coming.

1532
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:03,833
Thank you.

1533
01:46:04,066 --> 01:46:04,500
Thank you.

1534
01:46:05,233 --> 01:46:05,500
Thank you.

1535
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:05,833
Thank you.

1536
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:06,833
Thank you.

1537
01:46:14,333 --> 01:46:15,600
And I didn't say thank you to the panel.

1538
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:16,633
That was so rude of me.

1539
01:46:16,866 --> 01:46:19,800
Norman Finkelstein, Moon Ravani, Slavoj Zizek,

1540
01:46:20,133 --> 01:46:21,266
and Korta Lewis.

1541
01:46:21,466 --> 01:46:22,200
Thank you very much.

1542
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:22,566
Thank you.

1543
01:46:26,066 --> 01:46:31,733
Thank you very much.

1544
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,366
我们都可以安静下来 

1545
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,533
活动就要开始了.

1546
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:05,833
我叫奥利维亚.

1547
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:09,266
我在 Or Books 工作 负责活动和宣传 

1548
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:12,800
我们很高兴今天能邀请到

1549
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:16,066
我们出色的小组成员 作家 记者

1550
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,566
活动家 哲学家 来参加我们的

1551
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,066
"C大道现场 "系列活动之一

1552
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,433
今晚 我们的活动是为了纪念这本精彩的书的发行 

1553
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:30,466
这本书在酒吧门口出售

1554
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,300
穆因和库尔特都是这本书的撰稿人 

1555
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,400
不幸的是 编辑杰米 

1556
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:44,733
今晚无法前来 但我们出色的主持人拉齐娅 

1557
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,366
将由他致开幕词 

1558
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,600
我们希望您能参加我们更多的精彩活动 

1559
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,533
下一次活动将于 5 月 15 日举行 

1560
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:55,200
我们的另一本书《公司政变》 

1561
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,200
但现在 我将让位

1562
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,300
非常感谢我们的小组成员和主持人

1563
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,400
以及今晚到场的各位 

1564
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,933
非常感谢

1565
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:04,300
谢谢大家 

1566
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:04,833
谢谢

1567
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:05,333
谢谢

1568
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:07,166
谢谢

1569
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,300
谢谢 奥利维亚

1570
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:10,800
谢谢 科林

1571
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,766
非常感谢各位的到来 

1572
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,066
也感谢所有线上参加的朋友 

1573
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,900
请您暂时想象一下 我是这本书的编辑 

1574
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,000
杰米·斯特恩-维纳 

1575
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:25,000
这是他的开场白 

1576
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:27,000
他很抱歉不能来这里 

1577
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:29,566
因此 我首先要感谢全书出版社的奥利维亚

1578
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,733
组织了这次会议

1579
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:33,600
感谢拉齐娅为我主持会议 

1580
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,900
感谢所有小组成员的参与 

1581
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,166
就新书发布而言 这是一个阴郁的事件 

1582
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:42,000
但这又是一本阴郁的书和一个阴郁的时刻 

1583
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:47,366
根据最新的人道主义报告 以色列在加沙杀害了

1584
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,533
33 000 多人 其中大部分是妇女和儿童 

1585
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:58,466
以色列还部分或完全摧毁了加沙 60% 以上的房屋 

1586
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,866
一场蓄意制造的饥荒即使还没有开始 

1587
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,300
也是迫在眉睫 

1588
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:08,900
10 月 联合国秘书长安东尼奥-古特雷斯注意到

1589
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:12,600
这场灾难 引用 并非凭空发生的 

1590
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,766
本周 英勇的联合国巴勒斯坦难民救济和工程处指出 

1591
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,166
目前在那里发生的危机是前所未有的 

1592
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:25,266
这两种说法都是正确的 

1593
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,000
加沙所发生的一切是长期 

1594
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:30,733
多层次不公正的产物 

1595
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,166
也就是说 几十年来的额剥夺 

1596
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,533
吞并 围困和屠杀 

1597
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,800
目前的灾难在关键方面

1598
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,500
也有新的突破 

1599
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:46,000
通过这本书 我试图阐明

1600
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,266
加沙正在发生的事情

1601
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,866
的连续性和分裂性 

1602
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:53,800
为读者提供必要的重要背景资料 

1603
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,366
让他们了解事情是如何发展到

1604
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,933
今天这个可怕的地步的 

1605
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,533
同时也对冲突历史上的

1606
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:04,100
一个转折点进行初步分析 

1607
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:09,433
科尔特·刘易斯根据自己的博士论文在书中所写的一章 

1608
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:13,333
贯穿了1967年以来巴以冲突的整个外交背景 

1609
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:16,800
他权威地指出 

1610
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:21,566
以色列曾有一次又一次的机会以合理的条件解决冲突 

1611
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,000
先是与巴勒斯坦解放组织 

1612
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:27,866
然后是在2006年当选后与数百个国家 

1613
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:35,333
我认为 正是因为以色列及其国际帮凶拒绝了这些机会 

1614
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:37,433
才导致了今天的局面 

1615
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:40,833
穆欣-拉巴尼的文章将加沙战争

1616
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,600
置于两个关键的地区动态之中 

1617
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:47,166
一方面 美国促成和鼓励了

1618
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,900
以色列与海湾国家之间的关系升温；

1619
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:54,066
另一方面 哈马斯与由伊朗和真主党领导的

1620
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:57,266
所谓“抵抗轴心”的关系则呈现出对比 

1621
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,433
书中最令人心碎的段落之一是

1622
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:04,466
穆欣对倒霉的美国国务卿安东尼·布林肯的描述 

1623
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,900
他卑躬屈膝地穿梭于阿拉伯各国政府之间 

1624
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:12,100
乞求他们帮助以色列摆脱困境 结果除了那破碎的 

1625
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:15,366
死气沉沉的凝视之外 什么也没带回来 

1626
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,000
诺曼-芬克尔斯坦和斯拉沃伊-齐泽克

1627
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,300
当然不需要我介绍 

1628
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,233
我只是借此机会感谢他们的参与

1629
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:28,600
并特别感谢诺曼为本书提供的帮助

1630
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:31,300
以及他一生为真理和正义

1631
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,533
不惜牺牲一切的模范事迹 

1632
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,033
除了加沙骇人听闻的破坏之外 

1633
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:39,666
现在真正存在的一种可能性是 

1634
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,866
冲突将升级 点燃整个地区 

1635
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:44,066
并波及世界其他地区 

1636
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,366
这里的风险再高不过了 

1637
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:49,700
现在我很高兴把时间交给一个专家小组 

1638
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:53,733
他们的装备再好不过了 可以帮助我们度过这一难关 

1639
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:54,600
谢谢 

1640
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,700
感谢杰米

1641
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,433
我只想简单介绍一下我们的工作流程 

1642
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,966
每位小组成员的发言时间约为六 七分钟

1643
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,566
介绍他们对当前危机的看法 

1644
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,633
然后  我们五人将进行讨论 

1645
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,433
然后 我们将开放现场提问 

1646
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,766
也可能向在线观众提出一些问题 

1647
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,400
在开始之前 我还想补充一点

1648
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:27,666
在我们开始补充杰米的话之前 我只想再补充一件事 

1649
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:33,800
我们每天面对的数字似乎深不可测 

1650
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,033
今天是开斋节 

1651
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,433
祝那些正在庆祝的以及那些实际上无法庆祝的人们

1652
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:45,300
开斋节快乐 

1653
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,433
因为这些数字是如此深不可测

1654
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:50,966
如果可以的话 我希望我们所有人都能牢记：

1655
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,033
每个生命都是一个完整的世界 

1656
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,766
每个生命都是 

1657
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,600
因此 当我们面对这些庞大的数字时 

1658
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:06,300
这就是我想让大家在

1659
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,233
接受政治分析的同时思考的问题 

1660
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:13,500
潜在的后果还会出现 

1661
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,166
非常感谢各位今晚的光临 

1662
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,766
我们先从科尔特开始

1663
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,533
当然 他也在本书中发表过文章 

1664
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:26,733
好的 谢谢你 拉齐娅

1665
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,933
最近几周 乔-拜登政府声称 

1666
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:36,233
一旦当前的加沙危机结束 

1667
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:43,166
它将重振（引述原文）

1668
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,266
为以色列-巴勒斯坦冲突建立两国解决方案的共同努力 

1669
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,466
然而 哈马斯在两国解决方案中

1670
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:53,100
没有一席之地的说法更加强烈 

1671
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,433
你知道这种说法 

1672
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,633
哈马斯致力于摧毁以色列国 

1673
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,500
因此 必须摧毁哈马斯本身 

1674
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:07,233
因此 如果我们想在该地区看到任何和平 

1675
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:10,533
加沙的种族灭绝就必须继续下去 

1676
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:16,733
当然 像这样将以-巴冲突的顽固性归咎于

1677
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:20,566
巴勒斯坦领导人的说法并不新鲜 

1678
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:24,700
几十年前 以色列外交部长阿巴-埃本 

1679
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:28,766
他声称 引用 巴勒斯坦领导层

1680
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,933
从未错过任何一个能够错过和平的机会 

1681
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:37,300
正如我在《大洪水》一书中试图证明的那样 

1682
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,766
现在 这一说法的主要问题是 

1683
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,133
它与事实记录完全矛盾 

1684
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:48,700
实际上 无论是巴勒斯坦解放组织(巴解组织) 

1685
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:50,666
还是后来的哈马斯 

1686
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,266
都以不同程度的清晰度 

1687
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,600
支持两国解决冲突的方案 

1688
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,966
而以色列 当然是在美国的单方面支持下 

1689
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,766
一直拒绝接受这样的决议 支持领土扩张 

1690
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,566
并在事实上经常诉诸非常血腥的军事攻击 

1691
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,366
以破坏巴勒斯坦和平进攻的威胁 

1692
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,866
如果以 1967 年 6

1693
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,000
月战争后的 巴解组织为例 

1694
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:26,866
巴解组织最初拒绝承认以色列的理由是完全可以理解的 

1695
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:30,166
他们不愿意接受一个

1696
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:32,900
通过剥夺和驱赶巴勒斯坦原住民

1697
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:35,433
而在78%的历史巴勒斯坦土地上

1698
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:37,966
建立起来的国家 

1699
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,533
然而 从 20 世纪 70 年代初开始 

1700
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:46,400
特别是 1973 年 10 月战争之后 

1701
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:50,833
亚西尔-阿拉法特以及巴勒斯坦核心领导层认识到 

1702
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:54,500
要使巴勒斯坦的主张在国际社会眼中合法化 

1703
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:58,166
就必须采取承认以色列的这一务实步骤 

1704
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,766
而早在 1976 年 1 月 

1705
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,333
巴解组织就在联合国安理会提出要这样做 

1706
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,266
可以预见的是 美国的反应是否决该决议 

1707
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,000
以色列则拒绝参加

1708
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:16,366
安全理事会的审议 

1709
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,200
并在黎巴嫩对巴勒斯坦难民进行了空袭 

1710
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:22,933
造成数十人死亡 

1711
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,166
20世纪70年代末 

1712
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,566
以色列的这种行为模式越来越明显 

1713
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:32,833
美国官员开始注意到 

1714
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:37,066
以色列在南黎巴嫩的打击行动与

1715
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,300
所谓的巴勒斯坦恐怖威胁关系不大 

1716
00:09:41,366 --> 00:09:44,600
事实上 一切都有关于试图

1717
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:49,233
将巴勒斯坦人从温和打回极端主义 

1718
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:52,233
这一战略的顶点当然是

1719
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:55,666
1982年6月以色列入侵黎巴嫩 

1720
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:59,566
由于害怕巴勒斯坦解放组织接受停火

1721
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,400
并在一年多的时间里

1722
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:06,633
严格遵守停火并再次倡导谈判 

1723
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,166
以色列强行进入黎巴嫩 

1724
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,700
杀害了15,000至20,000名

1725
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,100
巴勒斯坦人和黎巴嫩人 

1726
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,866
跳转到 25 年前 今天的以色列 

1727
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,366
或者说不是今天的以色列 而是2006年及之后的以色列 

1728
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,566
在哈马斯的和平进攻威胁下 

1729
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,333
实施了完全相同的瘟疫计划 

1730
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,766
哈马斯于2006年1月以改革纲领当选 

1731
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,133
它很快向华盛顿表示 

1732
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:45,466
愿意放弃其臭名昭著的 1988 年宪章 

1733
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,133
并加入旨在实现两国解决方案的谈判 

1734
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:52,166
关键在于这一点 

1735
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:56,266
在此后的 15 年里 华盛顿和特拉维夫从未表示过

1736
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:04,000
愿意尝试哈马斯的提议 

1737
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:08,733
相反 他们立即采取行动 

1738
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:15,666
通过卑鄙和非法的封锁来惩罚哈马斯领导人和加沙人民 

1739
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:23,833
当哈马斯威胁要摆脱其作为拒绝派恐怖组织的角色 

1740
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:26,400
并寻求加入谈判时 

1741
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:30,000
以色列则回归其长期以来的做法 

1742
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:33,566
大规模使用军事暴力 

1743
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:38,500
正如诺曼详细记录的那样 它在2006年 

1744
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:44,500
2008年 2012年和2014年实施了军事行动 

1745
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:48,200
几乎每次都是为了至少在一定程度上

1746
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:51,200
破坏巴勒斯坦的和平倡议 

1747
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:54,766
因此 当有人提出这个问题时

1748
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:58,900
在哈马斯拒绝参与外交活动 

1749
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:05,433
拒绝承认以色列的情况下 以色列如何与哈马斯共存？

1750
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:11,133
它尝试了15年 每一条它想走下去的道路 

1751
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:15,433
都被美国和以色列的力量所阻挡 

1752
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:17,900
正如我在本章中写到的 

1753
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,566
底线是这样的：如果不是因为以色列不仅错过 

1754
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,033
而且积极地拒绝和破坏 

1755
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:29,066
拒绝和破坏巴勒斯坦的每一个和平提议 

1756
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,966
那么 10月7日犯下的罪行 

1757
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,866
以及正在发生的更大罪行 

1758
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:37,233
即以色列在加沙的种族灭绝 

1759
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:39,566
就永远不会发生 

1760
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,766
它们永远不会发生 因为

1761
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,700
巴以冲突早就解决了 

1762
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:46,733
非常感谢 

1763
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:54,466
现在让我们来看看穆因-拉班 

1764
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:59,666
非常感谢你 Raziel 感谢 OR Books

1765
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,200
组织这次活动并邀请我参加 

1766
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:08,200
我认为这是我们应该挥舞书本的时刻 

1767
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:18,100
我特别想请你们不仅参阅沃尔特的精彩章节 

1768
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:25,533
还要参阅珍妮对该书的精彩介绍 

1769
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:32,433
我这一章讲的是 对不起 好吧 我还是靠近麦克风讲吧 

1770
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:36,200
是的 我会发言 您也提到了这一点 

1771
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:40,000
我的章节是关于当前危机的区域动态 

1772
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:45,066
鉴于时间限制 我想关注一个问题 

1773
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:51,400
即自10月7日以来突然涌现的许多即时评论家 

1774
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,400
对他们来说 这是一种信条 

1775
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,866
即哈马斯在10月7日对以色列

1776
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:03,966
发动袭击的主要动机是

1777
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,466
破坏以色列-沙特即将达成正常化协议的前景 

1778
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,466
我想解释一下为什么情况并非如此 

1779
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,500
我们不应该再认真对待这些蛊惑人心的人 

1780
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:24,633
当他们在乌克兰问题上喋喋不休的时候  在此之前 

1781
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:30,366
他们每隔几个月就会对新冠病毒和其他问题推翻自己的论述 

1782
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,966
一个关键问题是 

1783
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,633
讨论并不是真正意义上的以色列-沙特正常化协议 

1784
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,466
即以色列和沙特阿拉伯将

1785
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,700
在协议中相互做出主要让步 

1786
00:14:55,066 --> 00:15:01,400
相反 讨论的是以色列-沙特-美国协定 

1787
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:05,766
其中的关键承诺由美国做出 

1788
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:11,200
美国作出的主要承诺是

1789
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:16,433
对沙特阿拉伯作出的 具体来说是

1790
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:19,466
以对沙特阿拉伯的安全保证的形式 以及

1791
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:22,300
以交付一个具有铀浓缩能力的核反应堆的形式 

1792
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:26,966
仅凭这一点就可以看出 

1793
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,600
这种协议从一开始就极不可能达成 

1794
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:34,266
因为这些都是美国只有

1795
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,900
在获得国会批准后才能履行的承诺 

1796
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,433
由于各种各样的原因 

1797
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:44,233
我不会在这里深入讨论 

1798
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,233
国会极不可能同意

1799
00:15:47,266 --> 00:15:50,666
美国对沙特阿拉伯的这种正式承诺 

1800
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:55,266
第二 在这样一项协议的范围内 

1801
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,400
以色列将被要求向巴勒斯坦人作出若干姿态 

1802
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:02,866
尽管这些姿态在很大程度上是表面的 

1803
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,233
但我们面对的是一个

1804
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:12,066
连向巴勒斯坦人做出表面姿态

1805
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,366
都做不到的以色列政府 

1806
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:17,466
我认为拜登政府在某种程度上

1807
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:20,566
希望这能促使以色列总理

1808
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,733
内塔尼亚胡改变执政立场 

1809
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:29,533
把一些新法西斯右翼政党换成更加中间派的政党 

1810
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:32,466
问题在于 以色列最著名的反对派领导人

1811
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:39,833
亚伊尔-比布特 曾多次公开表示 

1812
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:45,500
如果美国承诺向沙特阿拉伯提供核反应堆 

1813
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:52,066
他将不会同意与沙特阿拉伯达成任何正常化协议 

1814
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,933
因此 我的第一点是 无论如何 

1815
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:59,133
这种协议都是极不可能的 

1816
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:03,166
我的第二点是 即使我错了 

1817
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,233
即使这样的协议已经迫在眉睫 

1818
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:09,300
而且 如果哈马斯已经迫在眉睫 

1819
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,433
这样的协议即将签署 

1820
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:16,733
那么他们发动这次袭击来破坏这样的协议是毫无意义的 

1821
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:18,966
因为如果我们回顾一下

1822
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,200
阿-以正常化协议的历史 

1823
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:24,633
没有任何记录表明 这样的正常化协议

1824
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:30,100
会因为以色列对巴勒斯坦人的政策而被推翻 中止或废除 

1825
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:34,000
所以如果你拿1979年

1826
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:38,400
埃及和以色列的主要和平条约来说 

1827
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:41,433
它不仅没有受到以色列在

1828
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,733
约旦河西岸和加沙地带

1829
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:52,200
持续扩张的影响 

1830
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:55,933
甚至没有受到Golta提到的1982年

1831
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:58,600
以色列入侵黎巴嫩的影响 

1832
00:17:58,633 --> 00:18:01,266
也没有受到萨巴·沙蒂玛大屠杀的影响 

1833
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,233
同样 1994年的约旦-以色列和平条约

1834
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:10,700
也没有受到以色列后续政策的影响 

1835
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:13,866
包括以色列在第二次起义期间

1836
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,733
对巴勒斯坦人的残酷镇压 

1837
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:26,333
以及最近由由贾里德-库什纳王子

1838
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:29,200
在特朗普政府期间促成的《亚伯拉罕和平协定》

1839
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,533
首先维受到2021年爆发的冲突的影响 

1840
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:35,333
实际上也未受到当前对加沙地带进行

1841
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:39,866
种族灭绝式袭击的危机的影响 

1842
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,400
换句话说 哈马斯最希望实现的是

1843
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:55,366
体面地将沙特与以色列的正常化协议

1844
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,933
推迟一段体面的时间 

1845
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:59,000
埋葬尸体 等等 

1846
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,233
我认为可以公平地得出结论 

1847
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:11,566
哈马斯的领导层会认为那根本不值得付出努力 

1848
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:15,000
事实上 如果我们看看哈马斯在

1849
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:18,600
10 月 7 日以及此后发表的声明 

1850
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:22,833
他们在几个月前发表了一份重要声明 试图对

1851
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:27,666
10 月 7 日的袭击进行解释 辩解和合理化 

1852
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,933
他们一次也没有提到沙特阿拉伯 

1853
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:34,666
一次也没有提到沙-以关系正常化的前景 

1854
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,500
他们确实谈到了地区和国际

1855
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,033
对塔利班问题的忽视和边缘化 

1856
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,900
但在更广泛的意义上 

1857
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:49,366
而不是他们希望破坏的任何具体协议 

1858
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:50,100
我没时间了吗？

1859
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,266
我只有一分钟

1860
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,033
因此 我最后的看法是 是的 

1861
00:19:58,466 --> 00:20:04,166
这种地区和国际边缘化以及巴勒斯坦问题的左翼化 

1862
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,900
以及利用阿-以关系正常化来反对巴勒斯坦人的权利 

1863
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:14,566
而不是将其作为争取巴勒斯坦人权利的筹码 

1864
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,200
这些因素在一般意义上都是其中的因素 

1865
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:22,500
我认为 这也解释了为什么

1866
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:28,766
以色列对加沙地带的种族灭绝

1867
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,766
已经持续了半年多 

1868
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,000
而地区和国际上却没有什么反应 

1869
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:33,933
非常感谢 

1870
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:36,133
谢谢 

1871
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:41,500
斯拉沃热·齐泽克

1872
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,300
好的

1873
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,133
首先 我必须强调 我为能来到这里而感到自豪 

1874
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,733
很抱歉 如果我从你开始说起 诺曼 

1875
00:20:49,566 --> 00:20:51,666
我觉得这听起来很可悲 

1876
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,800
但我是认真的 

1877
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:59,266
像你这样的人的存在是反对反犹太主义的最好论据 

1878
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,100
而非像你这样的人不存在 

1879
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:03,200
让我继续 

1880
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:05,700
我想简要地向你们报告一下

1881
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:08,633
我在欧洲经历的极其恐怖的内心震惊 

1882
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,066
也许你们中的一些人知道这件事 但这发生在欧洲 

1883
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:16,266
在斯坦福 我参加了一场书展 

1884
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:19,566
斯洛文尼亚是主宾国 

1885
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,933
因此我获准在开幕式上发言 

1886
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:26,633
我的发言 我几乎为此感到羞愧 

1887
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:30,566
绝对是小心翼翼 有节制的 

1888
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,900
我说 是的 我谴责哈马斯 谴责一切 

1889
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,866
我的观点只是巴勒斯坦人也在受苦 

1890
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,333
你知道发生了什么吗？

1891
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:47,500
现在 他们在每一个德国领土上都有一个特殊的职位 

1892
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:51,500
简而言之就是打击反犹太主义的政委 

1893
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,100
他和另外两个政客上了YouTube——

1894
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:58,566
你可以找到它——他们站起来 

1895
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,066
就像在过去的共产主义时代一样——

1896
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:07,966
但共产主义者更了解这一点——站起来开始对我大喊大叫 

1897
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,800
说我是反犹太主义者 我在平等化哈马斯 我是最糟糕的 

1898
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,300
我是根据语境来理解（加沙） 等等

1899
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:20,333
随后 德国大报《法兰克福汇报》等

1900
00:22:20,366 --> 00:22:23,766
对我进行了一系列攻击 

1901
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,333
其中一个标题非常清楚 

1902
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,333
哈马斯没有语境 

1903
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:33,900
字面上的意思是 你必须理解这一点 

1904
00:22:33,966 --> 00:22:36,833
你必须回到德国唯心主义形而上学 

1905
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:41,900
其思想是这是绝对的原始的深渊的邪恶 

1906
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,900
其思想是这是绝对的原始的深渊的邪恶 

1907
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:44,800
没有任何语境可以解释它 

1908
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,800
当我引用普里莫-列维的话作为回答时 

1909
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,766
他说分析大屠杀至关重要 

1910
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,100
而不是说这是邪恶的 

1911
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:57,433
我又被攻击了...

1912
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:00,400
所以 让我不要浪费时间 

1913
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:02,600
那里还发生了另一件大事 

1914
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,200
我被指责将书展这一活动政治化

1915
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,000
哦 这（本应）是纯粹的文化活动 等等 

1916
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,366
但对我来说 有五位来自德国的发言者 

1917
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:21,533
他们都公开重申了一个动机 

1918
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:25,666
那就是完全无条件地支持以色列 

1919
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:31,000
而我刚一补充说 巴勒斯坦人也在遭受苦难 

1920
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:34,366
我就被指责将年轻人政治化 

1921
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:39,400
这让我想到了以色列今天和昨天发生的事情 

1922
00:23:40,033 --> 00:23:44,033
要知道 那里的哲学教授阿纳德-马塔尔——

1923
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:46,866
现在是一件非常可悲的事情——

1924
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:52,300
因为她发表了一些对以色列来说是既定的 有问题的言论 

1925
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:54,500
好吧 他们想在大学里开除她 

1926
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:57,400
但有两件事是不祥之兆 

1927
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,066
首先 学生们抗议她 

1928
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:09,000
我在里根时代访问伯克利时也注意到同样的事情 

1929
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:15,233
教授——通常是68岁的老人——比学生进步得多 

1930
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:21,166
我不知道这里的情况如何 但在整个欧洲 

1931
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,400
年轻一代的男性大多越来越反动 

1932
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:30,566
此外 Anab Matath 的论点 

1933
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,333
即每种伦理都是基于政治决策的 

1934
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,800
在这里得到了充分的证明 

1935
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,100
因为 你看 在法国发生了什么 

1936
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:44,433
当他们声称 不 

1937
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:47,666
第一批全力支持以色列的人是非政治的 

1938
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,433
它们只是同情 不 

1939
00:24:51,466 --> 00:24:54,933
这种判断的去政治化就是最肮脏的政治 

1940
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,400
让我继续 

1941
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:10,466
德国哲学的失败 作为对这些针对我的攻击的回应 

1942
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,500
与他们一起把我逼入这般境地 

1943
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:19,533
尤尔根·哈贝马斯——你可以说是德国的国家哲学家 

1944
00:25:19,566 --> 00:25:23,800
以及他的两位追随者写了一封公开信 

1945
00:25:23,866 --> 00:25:29,366
他们没有提到我 但我在那里有我的克格勃特工 

1946
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,633
他们反对我的观点 

1947
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,700
宣称要无条件支持 你知道的 常见的废话 

1948
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:40,733
以色列是中东唯一的民主社会等等 

1949
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,033
现在我得出结论 这就是我着迷的地方 

1950
00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:47,233
甚至是哲学的重要性 

1951
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:49,900
你知道哈贝马斯放弃了什么吗？

1952
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:54,666
法兰克福学派第一代伟大的思想家 

1953
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,733
阿多诺和霍克海默所称的“启蒙的辩证法” 

1954
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,800
意味着正在发生的恐怖 

1955
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,833
如殖民主义 古拉格 犹太人大屠杀 

1956
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,933
并非来自黑暗的中世纪过去的残余 

1957
00:26:10,966 --> 00:26:15,000
而是欧洲现代性项目内在对立的结果 

1958
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:19,066
在哈贝马斯这里 这一点消失了 

1959
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,133
我们只是需要更多的欧洲启蒙 等等 

1960
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,800
最后 如果你们愿意 可以向我提问 

1961
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,333
要知道 我们真的生活在一个悲伤的时代 

1962
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:35,533
不仅是德国 我还可以解释一下 

1963
00:26:35,566 --> 00:26:39,366
德国正在做你能想象到的最不道德的事情 

1964
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
大家都知道

1965
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:45,833
我们的逻辑是 大屠杀是我们干的 

1966
00:26:45,866 --> 00:26:50,566
所以现在作为与以色列的肮脏交易 

1967
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,700
我们会说你们是我们的受害者 

1968
00:26:54,733 --> 00:27:00,033
但作为交换 我们容忍你们今天的罪行 

1969
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:05,400
人们喜欢提及今天发生在海地的帮派接管事件 

1970
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:11,166
但这不仅发生在海地 甚至发生在世界各地的发达国家 

1971
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,666
你是否注意到

1972
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:19,100
如果国家权力不直接利用最终属于犯罪团伙的力量 

1973
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:22,133
就无法自我复制？

1974
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:25,133
特朗普在这里需要自豪男孩等组织 

1975
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:29,600
而在以色列 让我们面对现实吧 

1976
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:37,166
西岸的定居者运动是被以色列当权者巧妙利用的非法犯罪团伙 

1977
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:43,200
不幸的是 这就是我们今天的处境 

1978
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:46,833
用个可悲的词来说 半分钟后 

1979
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:49,733
面具就掉下来了 

1980
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:53,466
我很震惊 你知道 我的反应就像 

1981
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,266
在《汤姆和杰瑞》里 当事情发生时 眼睛蹦出来 

1982
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,333
一个月前 当内塔尼亚胡公开说："从河到海 

1983
00:28:02,366 --> 00:28:06,400
都是大以色列 "时 我的反应也是如此 

1984
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,066
因此 以前还比较谨慎的事情 现在都公开进行了 

1985
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:19,733
我们正在进入一个新的时代 

1986
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,366
一个极其危险的时代 而我 天真地认为 

1987
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,466
虽然他们在欧洲人权问题上是虚伪的 

1988
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,133
但也许还是有好东西的 

1989
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,466
我的意思是 现在在加沙发生的事情就是欧洲的死亡 

1990
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:41,000
从这个意义上讲 你知道 如果你和一个巴勒斯坦人交谈 

1991
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:45,266
他会告诉你 是的 欧洲人权是落在我们身上的绊脚石 

1992
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,300
最后是诺曼-芬克尔斯坦 

1993
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,100
谢谢 

1994
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:05,733
麦正常么？

1995
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:06,166
好的 

1996
00:29:06,966 --> 00:29:12,633
谢谢你们邀请我 我要公开感谢

1997
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:18,333
珍妮-斯特恩韦勒和霍尔特

1998
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,900
因为无论如何 对我来说 

1999
00:29:23,966 --> 00:29:29,700
他们两人都代表着相对年轻的一代 

2000
00:29:30,966 --> 00:29:34,566
对我自己来说 我非常希望

2001
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,200
他们能继续这一传统 

2002
00:29:38,266 --> 00:29:41,866
努力反击 并在斗争中

2003
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:45,533
运用你的智慧以及你的热情 

2004
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:53,733
穆因现在是我的老朋友 也是我的同事和战友 

2005
00:29:53,766 --> 00:30:02,700
我们一起经历了命运的约定 这可能会被标记为一个世界历史事件 

2006
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:06,566
我很高兴这是与穆因一起的 

2007
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:13,466
尽管我仍然坚持认为他对我的情况来说太过正式了 

2008
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:21,833
显然 种族灭绝是没有一线希望的 

2009
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:27,300
试图假装有一线希望是有罪的 

2010
00:30:28,366 --> 00:30:32,966
因此 我不想将其描述为一线希望 

2011
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
我更愿意简单地表达我的观点 

2012
00:30:37,066 --> 00:30:41,933
即为什么我相信 尽管情况不容乐观 

2013
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,700
为什么我认为我们所做的是有意义的 

2014
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:53,066
以及为什么我们不应该在面对明显不满意的结果时 

2015
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,566
哪怕一刻也不放松 

2016
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,400
所以我将回顾过去六个月中

2017
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:04,133
一些让我感到希望的事情 

2018
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:10,966
尽管如我所说 对于那些无法达到终点的人来说 

2019
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,766
这并没有什么安慰 

2020
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,266
这将是一份非常个性化的名单 

2021
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:23,300
正如我们可以证明的那样 

2022
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:28,933
在10月7日事件发生后的很早一段时间里 

2023
00:31:28,966 --> 00:31:32,033
就有一些人迫不及待地试图

2024
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:37,166
将这起种族灭绝案件提交给国际法院审理 

2025
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:44,066
我觉得这完全是浪费时间 

2026
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,366
我无法相信 世界上会有任何国家

2027
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:57,500
愿意为了一个实际上无国籍的民族 

2028
00:31:57,533 --> 00:32:00,933
一个没有权力和财富的民族 

2029
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:05,166
而冒险与美国对抗 

2030
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:12,033
因此 当南非站出来的时候 我感到非常震惊 

2031
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,266
他们站出来不仅仅是一种象征性的姿态 

2032
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,300
而是以一种非常专业的方式 

2033
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:23,066
甚至可以说是深刻的方式站出来的 

2034
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:29,066
他们向法庭提交了一份申请书 

2035
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:33,466
该申请书就像一份法庭辩护状 

2036
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,300
其中有数百个脚注 

2037
00:32:36,366 --> 00:32:39,166
在表述上极为精炼 

2038
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:45,133
他们选择了非常令人印象深刻的人代表南非 

2039
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,766
其中包括我的老朋友 国际法学家约翰-杜加尔德 

2040
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:57,333
他是一位非常令人印象深刻的人 即使已经 87 岁高龄 

2041
00:32:57,366 --> 00:33:01,466
当他走到麦克风前时还有些摇摇晃晃 

2042
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,866
但他仍然做了非常有力的发言 

2043
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:11,866
在许多方面 这是一个由男人 女人 黑人 

2044
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:18,433
白人 外国人 南非人组成的出色的代表团

2045
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:26,333
在可能的范围内 他们是在期待一个更美好的世界 

2046
00:33:26,366 --> 00:33:31,733
他们所做的一切都是为了加沙人民 

2047
00:33:33,866 --> 00:33:37,166
这些脚注让我印象深刻的一点是 

2048
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,366
我觉得这些注释有点学术性 但请原谅我 

2049
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:44,600
这些脚注让我印象深刻的一点是

2050
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:48,933
它完全依赖于联合国机构和联合国文件 

2051
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:54,366
其中提到了一些人权组织 

2052
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:01,266
对于任何长期参与这一事件的人来说 

2053
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,700
你知道每年都有成百上千 

2054
00:34:04,733 --> 00:34:08,133
成千上万的报告发布 

2055
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:12,366
你不禁翻起白眼 想知道 

2056
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,300
这些堆积如山的报告 

2057
00:34:15,366 --> 00:34:19,133
除了可能全世界就五个人会读外 

2058
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:22,933
难道不都是在浪费纸张吗？

2059
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:30,400
突然间 那些周而复始地记录着

2060
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:36,733
死亡 饥饿 毁灭的人们的劳动成果

2061
00:34:36,766 --> 00:34:42,033
还有那些积满灰尘和蜘蛛网的纸张 

2062
00:34:42,033 --> 00:34:48,100
突然间变得鲜活起来 

2063
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:56,000
对我自己来说 这是一次觉醒 

2064
00:34:56,033 --> 00:35:00,900
有时你在一个角落里努力工作 

2065
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:05,300
认为这都是浪费时间 

2066
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:09,666
我为什么要这样做 没有人读它 

2067
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:14,600
突然它成为了向国际法院申请的原材料 

2068
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:19,533
这是因为它的精确 

2069
00:35:19,566 --> 00:35:24,200
因为这些组织的中立性 

2070
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:28,300
它变得不可抗拒和不可战胜 

2071
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:34,800
这就引出了第三点 即国际法院本身发生了什么 

2072
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:43,966
我每天都会通过电子邮件或与莫琳交谈 

2073
00:35:44,966 --> 00:35:46,266
我一直在计算数字 

2074
00:35:46,966 --> 00:35:50,633
他们不可能让超过六个国家参与这场

2075
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:54,833
貌似有理的种族灭绝 

2076
00:35:56,533 --> 00:36:00,200
我会说出这些国家的名字 当然 我说 当然 

2077
00:36:00,266 --> 00:36:03,933
忘了美国 忘了德国 不要浪费你的时间 

2078
00:36:04,466 --> 00:36:05,933
我还说 忘了澳大利亚吧 

2079
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,266
我很高兴我错了 

2080
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,066
我很高兴我的错误是有道理的 

2081
00:36:13,033 --> 00:36:13,500
比分是 15 比 2 

2082
00:36:15,866 --> 00:36:20,200
仅有的两名反对者是以色列法官和法庭 

2083
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:23,366
以及这位来自乌干达的妇女 

2084
00:36:24,366 --> 00:36:28,200
我希望她能得到一辆好车和一枚戒指

2085
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:32,066
很显然 她写的东西根本不是她自己写的 

2086
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,433
这一点非常明显 

2087
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:39,766
后来 国际法院的判决是 15 比 2 但这并没有停止 

2088
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:44,233
非洲又上交了一次报告 

2089
00:36:44,233 --> 00:36:49,133
这又是一份非常专业的声明 

2090
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,466
大量脚注

2091
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:58,266
对加沙人民来说 这已经是第三次了 

2092
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,966
它停不下来 

2093
00:37:00,966 --> 00:37:02,166
它不肯罢休 

2094
00:37:03,566 --> 00:37:09,200
随后 国际法院又就一个类似但不同的问题

2095
00:37:09,233 --> 00:37:12,466
审理了一个新的案件 

2096
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:17,433
因此 国际法院现在有两起以色列案件 

2097
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:21,100
然后 你猜会发生什么？

2098
00:37:22,133 --> 00:37:28,466
尼加拉瓜也加入进来 它对德国提出诉讼 

2099
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:33,500
指控德国纵容在加沙的种族灭绝 

2100
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:42,333
你突然发现 所有这些可能性都为你的倡议打开了大门 

2101
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,533
他们还没有解决任何确定的问题 

2102
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:52,800
但存在可能性和潜在性 

2103
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:57,000
我还未读过德文 

2104
00:37:57,033 --> 00:38:00,500
尼加拉瓜文和德国的回应 但我不得不说 

2105
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:04,000
我笑得很开心 因为我确实

2106
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:07,533
听了德国人的一位发言人的发言 

2107
00:38:07,566 --> 00:38:12,933
德国人喜欢说 哦 我们这样做是为了自己的国家 

2108
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,800
因为我们有一个特别的人 

2109
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:19,166
他因为大屠杀而致力于以色列 

2110
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,200
这位尼加拉瓜人是一位农民 曾任尼加拉瓜驻荷兰代表 

2111
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,200
他说 你知道吗 

2112
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:30,433
德国人从这场战争中赚了很多钱 

2113
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,133
他开始查阅所有的军事合同 

2114
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:37,166
突然间 面具稍微掉落了一些 

2115
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:40,333
这全是关于国家理性 你知道的 

2116
00:38:40,366 --> 00:38:44,900
使用的是冷静的术语 同时从中赚取大量的金钱 

2117
00:38:46,800 --> 00:39:00,866
最后 在我结束发言的时候 我要感谢两组人 

2118
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,066
首先 我发现年轻人

2119
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,966
在过去六个月里的反应绝对是英雄式的 

2120
00:39:10,033 --> 00:39:13,966
完全鼓舞人心 他们不断地站出来 

2121
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,833
站出来 再站出来 

2122
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:20,466
我不记得越战时期有过这样的事 

2123
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:25,066
我们也许每六个月或更长时间举行一次大规模示威 

2124
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,866
也许每三个月一次 

2125
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,800
但年轻人的坚持和毅力

2126
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:33,933
确实令人鼓舞 

2127
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:37,633
我知道 当我去参加示威游行时 

2128
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:41,100
我和人群中除我以外的

2129
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:43,300
最年长的人通常相差40岁 

2130
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,333
我猜他们大多是25岁的年轻人 

2131
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,400
我最想感谢的一群人是胡塞武装 

2132
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:55,233
我觉得非常鼓舞人心的是 

2133
00:39:55,266 --> 00:39:59,066
据我所知 地球上最贫穷的国家 

2134
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,900
正如我所理解的 对吗?

2135
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:07,666
在中东 因为我前几天在读到过 

2136
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:10,966
在这个星球上 是在中东 

2137
00:40:11,466 --> 00:40:14,600
他们坚韧不拔 甘愿受苦 

2138
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:17,800
这总是让人联想到 

2139
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:21,433
最后我想说的是 

2140
00:40:21,466 --> 00:40:25,066
读过卢梭《卢梭二论》的人都知道 

2141
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,000
卢梭认为他所说的野蛮人

2142
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:32,966
比文明人更有道德 因为他说 

2143
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,900
使人人性化的东西 

2144
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:40,833
使人成为人的东西 并不是他们的理性 

2145
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:48,600
而是他们的怜悯 怜悯是一种自然的能力 

2146
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:53,700
怜悯是人类一切积极事物的源泉 

2147
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:58,533
他说 你受的教育越多 

2148
00:40:58,566 --> 00:41:03,100
首先 你会变得越自私；

2149
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:06,866
其次 教育培养了你

2150
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,533
为自己不采取行动而找理由的能力 

2151
00:41:11,766 --> 00:41:18,133
所以他说 一个哲学家向窗外望去 

2152
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:24,533
看到有人在他外面的大街上挨打 

2153
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:28,666
他只需要闭上耳朵说 

2154
00:41:28,733 --> 00:41:32,833
随你去死吧 我很安全

2155
00:41:33,966 --> 00:41:36,800
这就是哲学家的信条的哲学

2156
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,700
但那些不文明的人

2157
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:46,333
他们没有能力将自己对

2158
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,766
人类苦难的漠不关心合理化

2159
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:56,100
我一直认为这是一个可信的论点 而且

2160
00:41:56,133 --> 00:42:01,633
我认为胡塞武装的行动证明了这一点 

2161
00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:05,500
昨天 杰米发给我一个视频剪辑 

2162
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:10,100
我猜你也看到了 视频里是一些也门渔民 

2163
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:15,133
他们反对胡塞武装 他们谈到了自己的苦难 

2164
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:20,133
因为美国在这边 伊朗在那边 他们无法捕鱼 

2165
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:26,066
但他们说 我们可以证实 他们说 

2166
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:31,000
我们不在乎 加沙的人民在受苦 

2167
00:42:31,266 --> 00:42:32,433
胡塞是他们的敌人 

2168
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:36,233
（但）他们说 如果是为了

2169
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,866
巴勒斯坦 加沙的受苦人民 

2170
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:40,433
我们接受这一切 

2171
00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:45,433
这是一种美好的情感 对我很有启发 

2172
00:42:54,966 --> 00:42:55,200
谢谢 

2173
00:42:55,966 --> 00:42:56,833
非常感谢大家 

2174
00:42:56,966 --> 00:42:59,733
我想先问问你们每个人 

2175
00:42:59,766 --> 00:43:02,533
首先还是问你们诺曼吧 

2176
00:43:02,566 --> 00:43:09,366
因为你们谈到了南非提出的国际法院案件给你们带来的希望 

2177
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:14,200
而当时美国国务卿说该案件没有法律依据 

2178
00:43:14,966 --> 00:43:20,333
类似的说法也出现在以色列提出辩护之后 

2179
00:43:20,366 --> 00:43:24,033
就在几天前 在参议院面前 

2180
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:28,566
美国国防部长说 没有什么可看的 

2181
00:43:28,633 --> 00:43:32,000
他们没有种族灭绝的证据 

2182
00:43:32,033 --> 00:43:36,866
鉴于美国的所作所为及其

2183
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,733
在过去六个月中非常缓慢的立场转变 

2184
00:43:41,766 --> 00:43:50,066
你如何看待美国在挽回颜面 深刻改变美国外交政策 

2185
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:55,633
改变对以色列的态度方面的可能性？

2186
00:43:56,866 --> 00:44:01,300
您如何看待他们迄今为止 最近所说的话？

2187
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:06,866
我认为最大的变化不是在实际政治层面 

2188
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,733
而是在公众舆论层面 

2189
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,366
我举两个例子来说明这一点 

2190
00:44:16,566 --> 00:44:24,500
第一个几乎是令人窒息的时刻是查尔斯·舒默

2191
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:31,066
就当前形势发表了讲话 

2192
00:44:32,033 --> 00:44:35,033
舒默参议员在美国参议院一直是

2193
00:44:35,066 --> 00:44:38,066
以色列最重要的支持者 

2194
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:40,266
他反对伊朗协议 

2195
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:43,533
我认为他和新泽西州的梅嫩德斯是

2196
00:44:43,566 --> 00:44:47,233
唯二反对这项协议的资深民主党参议员 

2197
00:44:48,266 --> 00:44:50,733
而且他的履历非常糟糕 

2198
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:56,266
2010 年 他在一群东正教拉比面前说 

2199
00:44:56,266 --> 00:45:02,133
我们应该从经济上扼杀加沙 你知道 加沙有一百万儿童 

2200
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,133
他说 我们应该在经济上扼杀它 

2201
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,566
他宣读了自己的演讲稿 非常精彩 

2202
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:18,833
首先 他将目前僵局的责任完全归咎于

2203
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,700
以色列和哈马斯 

2204
00:45:20,766 --> 00:45:22,566
或者以色列和巴勒斯坦 

2205
00:45:23,366 --> 00:45:26,366
他一方面说问题在于

2206
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,266
内塔尼亚胡和以色列极右翼 

2207
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:32,833
另一方面又说问题在于

2208
00:45:32,866 --> 00:45:36,366
哈马斯和巴勒斯坦权力机构的腐败 

2209
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:39,333
他非常注意平衡 

2210
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:44,433
接着 他又试图为以色列不是

2211
00:45:44,466 --> 00:45:49,433
殖民定居者国家的说法进行辩护 

2212
00:45:49,466 --> 00:45:52,500
大约 6 个月前 这甚至还不是

2213
00:45:52,533 --> 00:45:55,566
那些精英们讨论的话题 

2214
00:45:55,566 --> 00:46:00,500
但他突然觉得有必要理性地解释一下

2215
00:46:00,533 --> 00:46:05,466
为什么他认为这在历史上是不正确的 

2216
00:46:07,066 --> 00:46:10,266
接着 他不得不解释

2217
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,400
为什么一个国家的想法是错误的 

2218
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,400
根据国际大屠杀纪念联盟的定义 

2219
00:46:18,433 --> 00:46:22,133
一个国家被正式视为反犹太主义

2220
00:46:23,066 --> 00:46:26,200
有一个国家正式被定义为反犹太国家 

2221
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:28,466
舒默做了什么？

2222
00:46:29,766 --> 00:46:33,733
舒默参议员首先说 

2223
00:46:33,766 --> 00:46:37,733
我知道许多有理想的年轻人支持一个国家 

2224
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:41,100
他没说他们都是反犹太主义者 

2225
00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:44,933
他说 他们都是有理想的年轻人 

2226
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:50,600
因此 现在你看到民主党的基层

2227
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:55,366
不得不面对一个新的现实 

2228
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:02,300
即无论是从历史上还是作为一个犹太国家 

2229
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:08,133
以色列从根本上来说都是不合法的 

2230
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:13,500
对我来说 这只是在很短的时间内发生的转变 

2231
00:47:13,566 --> 00:47:16,800
尽管你可以说它已经酝酿了很长时间 

2232
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,133
这是民意的历史性转变 

2233
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:22,333
最后一件事 我不会说太多 

2234
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:24,300
我昨天打开了《纽约时报》 

2235
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,233
他们有一篇文章 讲的是伊朗如何向约旦河西岸

2236
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:34,200
提供所有这些武器 并从那里得到巨额人民币 

2237
00:47:34,233 --> 00:47:36,466
所以我很好奇 

2238
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,266
我翻到了这封文章的评论部分 

2239
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,133
我把它寄给了穆因 他可以再次确认 

2240
00:47:44,266 --> 00:47:46,066
你知道这封信读起来像什么吗？

2241
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:51,533
为什么伊朗不能向约旦河西岸提供武器?

2242
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:54,300
他们将要占领人民 

2243
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:56,466
他们有权武装抵抗 

2244
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:02,000
美国凭什么去谈论其他国家的人民提供武器这件事 

2245
00:48:02,033 --> 00:48:05,833
那里的人民在以此投票 我完全被吓到了 

2246
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:10,000
这是《纽约时报》 

2247
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:14,100
通常这样的信件会被直接丢弃 

2248
00:48:14,966 --> 00:48:16,833
突然间 我没记错吧 

2249
00:48:16,866 --> 00:48:19,300
一个接一个 一个接一个 

2250
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:25,500
因此 即使是《泰晤士报》的读者在这一问题上

2251
00:48:25,566 --> 00:48:29,333
也已经脱离了合法观点的范围 

2252
00:48:30,766 --> 00:48:37,966
我想我们是否可以请您谈谈两国方案

2253
00:48:37,966 --> 00:48:40,333
与一国方案的问题 因为长期以来 

2254
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,566
两国方案一直是人们的口头禅 

2255
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:49,966
而越来越多的人认为它是空洞的口头禅 

2256
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,633
当然 如果我们谈论一个国家的解决方案 

2257
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:58,833
就会有来自各方的巨大问题 

2258
00:48:58,866 --> 00:49:03,500
因为这意味着它不再是一个民族主义事件 

2259
00:49:03,533 --> 00:49:05,966
不再是一个犹太国家 

2260
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,233
我想知道您如何看待中东内部

2261
00:49:10,266 --> 00:49:14,066
在这个问题上的转变 

2262
00:49:14,533 --> 00:49:18,900
是的 我有三点意见 

2263
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:23,566
我认为首先需要指出的是 

2264
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:27,733
当西方政客谈论两国解决方案时 

2265
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:32,333
我们需要看他们的行动 而不是他们的言辞 

2266
00:49:32,366 --> 00:49:36,233
对他们来说 两国解决方案只是一种转移视线的把戏 

2267
00:49:37,033 --> 00:49:38,000
这是烟雾弹 

2268
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,666
这是在用语言转移人们

2269
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,466
对他们行动的注意力 

2270
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:49,466
因为他们的行动正在破坏任何解决方案 

2271
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,366
尤其是结束以色列占领的前景 

2272
00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:57,333
因为这种占领正在通过

2273
00:49:57,366 --> 00:50:01,833
西方国家的积极或消极支持而被巩固 

2274
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:06,000
第二个问题是 两国方案

2275
00:50:06,033 --> 00:50:10,000
是否仍然可行 或者是否可行?

2276
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,666
我曾就此写过文章 我认为从实际情况来看 

2277
00:50:15,733 --> 00:50:19,400
两国解决方案仍然是可行的 

2278
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,600
以色列撤至 1967 年边界 

2279
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:27,466
并且 拆除定居点和对难民问题的公正解决 

2280
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,300
从原则上说 仍然是可行的 

2281
00:50:31,366 --> 00:50:35,766
我认为 一个有用的比较方法是 

2282
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:43,433
将以色列在西岸的地位与1915年英国在爱尔兰的地位 

2283
00:50:43,466 --> 00:50:48,433
1950年法国在阿尔及利亚的地位 

2284
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:54,366
1985年埃塞俄比亚在厄立特里亚的地位 

2285
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,833
1990年印尼在东帝汶的地位进行比较 

2286
00:50:59,866 --> 00:51:05,300
我认为在所有这些案例中你会发现 对不起 

2287
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:10,033
外国的存在在许多方面

2288
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:16,866
比以色列在被占领土上的存在更加根深蒂固 

2289
00:51:16,966 --> 00:51:21,900
现在 第三点变成了 好吧 如果它确实切实可行 

2290
00:51:21,933 --> 00:51:25,133
那么在过去六个月里发生了什么？

2291
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:28,066
在这里 我想说的是 

2292
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,900
对于许多以前认为这很实用 

2293
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,400
但现在也认为不再可取的人来说 

2294
00:51:33,433 --> 00:51:36,533
问题就变成了这样 

2295
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,433
在一个非理性 种族灭绝 

2296
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:50,866
种族隔离政权继续存在的情况下 中东能有持久的和平吗？

2297
00:51:51,533 --> 00:51:56,133
或者 作为中东和平的先决条件 

2298
00:51:56,166 --> 00:52:00,766
这个政权及其关键机构需要被摧毁吗?

2299
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:05,233
我认为 这些问题越来越多地

2300
00:52:05,266 --> 00:52:08,933
被提出来进行讨论 

2301
00:52:09,066 --> 00:52:13,700
我认为这方面没有简单的答案 

2302
00:52:14,066 --> 00:52:19,100
我最后要说的是 我的分析

2303
00:52:19,133 --> 00:52:24,166
绝非基于所谓奥斯陆进程的失败 

2304
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,933
我认为奥斯陆是 1945 年以来最成功的外交进程之一 

2305
00:52:28,966 --> 00:52:33,000
原因很简单 那就是奥斯陆从来都不是为了结束占领 

2306
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,800
这与两国解决方案无关 

2307
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:37,433
它从来都不是为了建立一个独立的巴勒斯坦国 

2308
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,900
而是为了重新制定和

2309
00:52:39,933 --> 00:52:45,566
巩固以色列对巴勒斯坦人的永久控制 

2310
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,633
从这个意义上说 它是成功的 

2311
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,600
科尔曼 你想回来回应一下吗？

2312
00:52:54,233 --> 00:52:56,866
我个人认为 

2313
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,533
现在根本不是谈论解决方案的时候 

2314
00:53:00,566 --> 00:53:03,300
首先 没有一个有代表性的

2315
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:06,566
巴勒斯坦组织可以与之谈判 

2316
00:53:07,666 --> 00:53:10,233
以色列的政治光谱是--

2317
00:53:10,266 --> 00:53:13,333
我不会随便用这个词 我以前没用过 

2318
00:53:13,366 --> 00:53:15,733
但我不会随便用--

2319
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,866
以色列的政治光谱是疯狂的 

2320
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,733
从右翼到极右翼 再到极右翼 

2321
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:25,700
没有中间 也没有左边 这只是一个事实问题 

2322
00:53:27,366 --> 00:53:30,900
所以没什么好商量的 

2323
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:34,233
可以说 2000年左右的《奥斯陆协议》

2324
00:53:34,266 --> 00:53:36,766
和《戴维营协议》 

2325
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,433
可以说 在那些年里 你仔细看看我所掌握的谈判情况 

2326
00:53:41,466 --> 00:53:43,833
他们一直在争论百分比的问题 

2327
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,466
因此 巴拉克说 我们希望

2328
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,966
保留80%的非法定居者 

2329
00:53:50,033 --> 00:53:55,033
我们希望在任何最终定居点保留80%的非法定居者 

2330
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,300
埃尔默说我们要保留 87% 

2331
00:54:02,233 --> 00:54:05,033
巴勒斯坦人说你们可以保留 60% 

2332
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:14,166
以色列人说 我们想保留西岸约 10%的土地 

2333
00:54:15,133 --> 00:54:21,000
巴勒斯坦人说 我们会让你们保留 2% 的约旦河西岸 

2334
00:54:21,766 --> 00:54:23,800
我不是说他们很接近 

2335
00:54:25,166 --> 00:54:30,200
差距仍然存在 也许不是鸿沟 但差距很大 

2336
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,600
但我们说的是百分比 

2337
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,166
但现在的以色列政府 

2338
00:54:36,233 --> 00:54:43,733
我们不能从他们那里得到一个扫帚间或一个面包箱给巴勒斯坦人 

2339
00:54:44,066 --> 00:54:48,200
所以 现在没有讨论的余地 

2340
00:54:48,666 --> 00:54:53,800
没有任何可以进行论证的两方立场 

2341
00:54:55,366 --> 00:54:58,933
第二点 在我看来 我们必须实事求是 

2342
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:03,066
战争可能会持续很长时间 

2343
00:55:05,466 --> 00:55:07,866
乌克兰战争已经过去两年多了 

2344
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:12,000
然后你可以看看越南战争 或者看看第二次世界大战 

2345
00:55:12,966 --> 00:55:16,866
大约六个月后 我不想这么说 

2346
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:23,600
但我认为我们很有可能仍然更接近开始 而不是结束 

2347
00:55:24,933 --> 00:55:27,833
因为如果你读了以色列的声明 

2348
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,733
你读了分析 就像我昨晚

2349
00:55:30,766 --> 00:55:36,566
读了一个来自JINSA的分析 

2350
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:41,233
它是犹太新保守主义疯子组织之一 

2351
00:55:41,266 --> 00:55:44,600
他们说 除非哈马斯遭到绝对 

2352
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:47,933
彻底 明确的失败 

2353
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,100
以色列取得绝对 彻底 

2354
00:55:52,133 --> 00:55:56,133
明确的胜利 否则不可能有任何结果 

2355
00:55:57,466 --> 00:56:02,166
而另一方面 真主党等组织则表示 

2356
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:06,933
我们不会接受哈马斯的彻底失败 

2357
00:56:06,966 --> 00:56:09,933
我们将尽一切必要的努力

2358
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:13,633
阻止哈马斯彻底失败 

2359
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:23,933
因此 我认为我们离结束目前的局面可能还很遥远 

2360
00:56:23,966 --> 00:56:29,200
现在谈论解决方案毫无意义 

2361
00:56:30,966 --> 00:56:35,533
斯拉瓦 让我们谈谈需要进行的道德清算 

2362
00:56:36,366 --> 00:56:39,266
即使我们接受诺曼的说法 

2363
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:42,166
这种情况也会持续很久很久 

2364
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:45,666
事实上 它已经发展到了今天的地步 

2365
00:56:46,633 --> 00:56:47,933
6 个月内有 33 000 人丧生 

2366
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:56,500
与 2021 年相比 这似乎是不可想象的 

2367
00:56:57,966 --> 00:56:59,533
科塔 帮我算算 

2368
00:56:59,566 --> 00:57:01,500
2021年有多少人丧生？

2369
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,066
所以是 1600 或类似的数字 

2370
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,866
最大的一次 "铸铅行动 是 1200 人 1400 人 

2371
00:57:09,966 --> 00:57:12,700
护刃行动造成 2 200 人丧生 

2372
00:57:14,133 --> 00:57:16,466
所以我们 你知道 完全不同 

2373
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:22,033
因此 鉴于西方世界继续自视甚高 

2374
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,300
尽管这种思想

2375
00:57:24,366 --> 00:57:26,433
在我们眼前分崩离析 

2376
00:57:26,466 --> 00:57:29,500
但它仍继续把自己视为

2377
00:57:29,566 --> 00:57:32,600
世界上发生的一切的道德仲裁者 

2378
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,900
我们该如何看待对未能保护加沙成千上万无辜民众的行为

2379
00:57:35,933 --> 00:57:43,133
进行道德清算的必要性?

2380
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:48,100
至关重要的问题 

2381
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:50,100
我只想简单说几句 以免迷失方向 

2382
00:57:50,566 --> 00:57:53,066
首先是关于 3 万人死亡的问题 

2383
00:57:54,533 --> 00:57:57,700
我认为这不仅仅是一个数据问题 

2384
00:57:58,466 --> 00:58:01,900
就连西方媒体也不否认这一数据 

2385
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,500
但是 特别是在德国 

2386
00:58:06,533 --> 00:58:11,166
但也在其他国家 有一种解释模式 

2387
00:58:11,566 --> 00:58:13,866
而在德国 这已经合法化了 

2388
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:18,033
即使是相对温和的文化部长 

2389
00:58:18,366 --> 00:58:24,966
我会称她为野蛮部长克劳迪娅·罗奇 她明确表示 她说 

2390
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:31,600
你可以严肃地——我对此有如汤姆和杰瑞般的反应——她说 

2391
00:58:31,666 --> 00:58:36,133
是的 我们可以谈论巴勒斯坦人的苦难 

2392
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:40,633
但我们应该明确最终是哈马斯对此负责 

2393
00:58:41,433 --> 00:58:46,100
这就好像 哈马斯正在进行一场大规模的自杀行动 

2394
00:58:46,133 --> 00:58:51,800
而以色列却莫名其妙地把上帝扯了进来 这必须改变 

2395
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:58,500
而且 正如指出的那样 改变这种公众认知是至关重要的 

2396
00:58:59,066 --> 00:59:03,000
例如 我们应该坚持以色列——好吧 

2397
00:59:03,033 --> 00:59:09,300
我们听到哈贝马斯等人的说法 唯一的民主国家——对不起 

2398
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:14,200
但一个月前或内塔尼亚胡反对两国解决方案时 

2399
00:59:14,233 --> 00:59:17,466
这意味着从河到海的大以色列 

2400
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,666
他说这是唯一的民主解决方案 

2401
00:59:20,733 --> 00:59:23,900
因为 我不知道这是否属实 

2402
00:59:23,933 --> 00:59:26,300
但他写了一些统计数据 

2403
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:31,966
现在以色列那里的犹太人中几乎有90% 90%反对它 

2404
00:59:32,966 --> 00:59:37,400
对不起 但如果你考虑到以色列控制的所有区域 

2405
00:59:37,433 --> 00:59:38,900
几乎是五五开 

2406
00:59:40,666 --> 00:59:44,433
犹太人可能只比巴勒斯坦人多一点点 

2407
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:51,100
她甚至没有提到 你看 这实际上是种族隔离 

2408
00:59:52,133 --> 00:59:53,866
那么我们能做什么呢？

2409
00:59:54,666 --> 00:59:57,333
还有一件事 也许沿着

2410
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,566
你通常强调公众舆论的实际路线 

2411
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:04,733
会发生一些事情 就像我知道的那样 

2412
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:09,166
也许我得用我在斯洛文尼亚的

2413
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,466
一些影响力稍微推动一下 

2414
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,066
但我从可靠消息来源得知 

2415
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:23,233
现在到六月底 七月 西班牙 爱尔兰 

2416
01:00:24,766 --> 01:00:30,600
而且这很好 我的小影响力起作用了 斯洛文尼亚 

2417
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:37,166
好吧 虽然不是世界上最大的声音 将公开承认巴勒斯坦 

2418
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:40,833
而且这些你通常提到的小迹象

2419
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:47,233
甚至连我不信任的人也提到了这一点 

2420
01:00:48,266 --> 01:00:52,300
戴维·卡梅伦 在某个时候 提到也许我们应该 

2421
01:00:52,366 --> 01:00:53,666
英国外交大臣 

2422
01:00:54,033 --> 01:00:54,600
是啊 是啊 

2423
01:00:54,966 --> 01:00:55,833
是啊 是啊 

2424
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:58,166
你知道现在

2425
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,200
英国的政治局势如何吗？

2426
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:04,466
你们有一个很大很大的中央右翼政党 

2427
01:01:04,966 --> 01:01:07,066
这就是所谓的工党 

2428
01:01:07,433 --> 01:01:10,400
然后 又有一些疯狂的右翼政党 

2429
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,766
好吧 但是 对不起 让我继续说 

2430
01:01:14,066 --> 01:01:17,566
因此 我想说的是 正如你所指出的 

2431
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,066
我们现在必须迈出下一步 

2432
01:01:20,566 --> 01:01:25,200
现在 谈论巴勒斯坦人的苦难已经合法化了 

2433
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:28,700
现在我们进入下一阶段

2434
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,033
那么 这种痛苦意味着什么呢？

2435
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:35,666
逻辑是 如果 是的 你必须同情 

2436
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:41,233
你会放那些愚蠢的降落伞 但是这意味着什么？

2437
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,600
我认为其中有一个想法

2438
01:01:44,633 --> 01:01:47,633
对我来说是这种情况的最佳象征 

2439
01:01:48,466 --> 01:01:50,033
我在大型媒体中发现了它 

2440
01:01:50,366 --> 01:01:57,833
这是一张相同的照片 你从加沙看到的 前面是以色列的炸弹 

2441
01:01:58,133 --> 01:02:02,866
由美国制造的炸弹 落在加沙 摧毁建筑物 

2442
01:02:03,266 --> 01:02:07,666
而就在后面 带着食物的降落伞也在下降 

2443
01:02:08,733 --> 01:02:09,366
这就是问题所在 

2444
01:02:09,466 --> 01:02:12,766
最后 请允许我简短地说一句 

2445
01:02:15,866 --> 01:02:17,400
你知道我们必须在哪一点上努力 

2446
01:02:18,066 --> 01:02:22,400
这些禁令是如何存在的 在哪里被允许去演说？

2447
01:02:22,666 --> 01:02:25,166
当我在法兰克福说我说的话时 

2448
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:30,233
最令我恶心的是 有几十个人 强硬派的德国人 

2449
01:02:30,266 --> 01:02:34,333
私下里走过来 真的小心翼翼地四处张望 

2450
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:39,133
然后对我耳语 你知道 基本上我同意你的观点 

2451
01:02:39,166 --> 01:02:42,600
只是现在不是说这些话的合适时机 

2452
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:45,666
我的回答当然是 我知道你是什么意思 

2453
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:50,666
合适的时机将是在说这些话毫无意义的时候 

2454
01:02:50,766 --> 01:02:53,300
而现在 说这些话是有意义的 

2455
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,033
所以你知道吗 我真的在想 

2456
01:02:56,066 --> 01:02:59,466
如果我也对你说这些话 你最终会同意吗 

2457
01:03:00,166 --> 01:03:01,400
我不相信他们 

2458
01:03:01,866 --> 01:03:04,800
但是 例如 你们可能都知道我是谁 

2459
01:03:04,866 --> 01:03:07,800
如果你们聪明的话 还包括Sinbad

2460
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:10,000
Moser的前老板 

2461
01:03:10,033 --> 01:03:12,566
但有一个人叫 我想叫阿米·阿亚顿 

2462
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:14,033
好的 

2463
01:03:14,366 --> 01:03:15,133
他现在已经退休了 

2464
01:03:15,466 --> 01:03:18,533
一旦你退休了 你就可以说很多话 

2465
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,666
所以 他写了一篇评论或接受了采访 

2466
01:03:21,966 --> 01:03:24,566
他说唯一的解决方案是

2467
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,200
允许巴勒斯坦人拥有政治主体性 

2468
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:32,433
甚至提出了一个非常实际的建议 释放马文·巴尔古提等人 

2469
01:03:34,266 --> 01:03:38,233
但如果你在德国说这话 会是什么情况 

2470
01:03:38,233 --> 01:03:41,533
作为一个前警察或辛贝特的主管 

2471
01:03:41,566 --> 01:03:46,200
我认为 如果你在德国说这话 几乎会被逮捕 

2472
01:03:46,766 --> 01:03:49,933
所以 不仅仅是 

2473
01:03:49,966 --> 01:03:53,133
在这样的地方说这些话是一回事等等 

2474
01:03:53,666 --> 01:03:57,433
在这一点上 斗争是有效的 

2475
01:03:57,466 --> 01:04:03,600
并且逐渐改变公众认知的斗争不是没有希望的 

2476
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,433
我只想说 你没有回答

2477
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,233
关于你的道德准则的问题 

2478
01:04:08,266 --> 01:04:09,266
我从未回答过这个问题 

2479
01:04:09,466 --> 01:04:10,233
好吧 那我继续 

2480
01:04:10,266 --> 01:04:14,733
我想知道你能否谈谈你是如何解释在你的文章中 

2481
01:04:14,766 --> 01:04:19,666
你如此仔细地记录和记录了这个事实 

2482
01:04:19,733 --> 01:04:30,966
即每一个哈马斯愿意参与并愿意表明

2483
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:40,200
其努力保持温和或参与和平进程的实例

2484
01:04:41,233 --> 01:04:44,766
然而 大多数人在了解正在发生的事情时

2485
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:48,166
所吸收的叙述 

2486
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,300
却是与西方政府和特别是以色列所框定的

2487
01:04:53,366 --> 01:04:57,200
（与你文章中）完全相反的叙述 

2488
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,966
你如何解释这种情况 

2489
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,666
即人们对你详细记录的内容缺乏了解？

2490
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,666
诺姆·乔姆斯基写了一本关于这个问题的书 《制造共识》 

2491
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:16,200
事实上 西方媒体普遍受制于

2492
01:05:16,266 --> 01:05:20,166
大企业的利益 

2493
01:05:21,366 --> 01:05:26,066
而且复述美国国家意见 符合它们的既得利益 

2494
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:30,466
因此它们不愿意告诉美国人和更广泛的西方人

2495
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:34,433
关于以色列对加沙的所作所为的真相 

2496
01:05:34,466 --> 01:05:37,466
不仅仅是自10月7日以来 

2497
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,500
而是在这之前一再发生的事情 

2498
01:05:40,966 --> 01:05:44,500
我可以举一个例子 铸铅行动 

2499
01:05:45,866 --> 01:05:51,733
关于铸铅行动的媒体叙述通常是将其描述为

2500
01:05:51,766 --> 01:05:57,633
以色列对哈马斯火箭袭击进行自卫的行为 

2501
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:01,100
但实际上铸铅行动是

2502
01:06:01,133 --> 01:06:04,533
以色列违反停火协议的产物 

2503
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:12,033
停火协议于2008年6月签署 以色列官员坦率地承认 

2504
01:06:12,066 --> 01:06:16,333
哈马斯激进分子严格遵守了停火协议 

2505
01:06:16,366 --> 01:06:22,633
并且带来了——我现在引用一位以色列国防官员的话——

2506
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:25,833
给加沙周边的以色列社区

2507
01:06:25,866 --> 01:06:29,000
带来了很大程度的和平与安宁 

2508
01:06:30,533 --> 01:06:33,266
停火协议的内容是

2509
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:36,066
哈马斯停止发射火箭 他们做到了 

2510
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:40,466
而以色列则将解除其非法和压制性的封锁 

2511
01:06:41,366 --> 01:06:41,866
事实并非如此 

2512
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:43,366
勉强缓解了一下 

2513
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,766
11月4日 对此 诺曼

2514
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,166
做了最详细的记录 但在11月4日 

2515
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:53,600
当美国人还沉浸在总统选举的喜悦中时 

2516
01:06:53,633 --> 01:06:58,866
以色列突袭加沙 打死六名巴勒斯坦武装分子 

2517
01:06:59,466 --> 01:07:04,533
这时 火箭弹开始飞来 以色列开始轰炸加沙 

2518
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:08,366
12 月 19 日 

2519
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,966
停火协议（为期 6 个月）到期 

2520
01:07:13,066 --> 01:07:16,400
几天之内 哈马斯通过

2521
01:07:16,433 --> 01:07:20,266
卡特中心相关人员 

2522
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:23,900
挪威等欧洲政府以及联合国

2523
01:07:23,933 --> 01:07:27,533
向以色列提出

2524
01:07:28,066 --> 01:07:30,200
恢复之前的停火协议 

2525
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:34,900
即巴勒斯坦人遵守而以色列不断违反的停火协议 

2526
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:40,400
两天后 12月21日 

2527
01:07:40,433 --> 01:07:44,500
以色列内阁召开会议 决定轰炸加沙

2528
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,266
并在那里发动一次大规模行动 

2529
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:51,166
事实上 自 2006 年以来 他们已经计划了多年 

2530
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:56,700
他们在黎巴嫩被真主党羞辱了 

2531
01:07:58,333 --> 01:08:02,300
不仅在12月21日的内阁会议上

2532
01:08:02,366 --> 01:08:07,066
决定要开始轰炸加沙 

2533
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:11,966
他们还决定谎报何时开始轰炸 

2534
01:08:13,433 --> 01:08:16,600
齐皮·利夫尼会见了当时的埃及总统

2535
01:08:16,633 --> 01:08:19,800
穆巴拉克 并让他知道

2536
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,600
直到12月28日星期天 

2537
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:30,066
以色列才会决定如何处理加沙不断升级的局势 

2538
01:08:31,066 --> 01:08:34,566
然而在12月27日上午11点30分 

2539
01:08:34,566 --> 01:08:41,066
以色列向小小的加沙投下了100吨炸弹 

2540
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,766
据人权组织称 在几分钟内

2541
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:48,966
他们杀死了多达300名巴勒斯坦人 

2542
01:08:49,766 --> 01:08:53,466
若说10月7日是以色列-巴勒斯坦冲突历史上

2543
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:57,200
最血腥的一天

2544
01:08:58,833 --> 01:09:01,166
当然 "铸铅行动 "开始的几分钟

2545
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,066
是最血腥的几分钟 

2546
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:10,166
当时的以色列前总理兼国防部长埃胡德·巴拉克夸耀说

2547
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:13,300
他在铸铅行动的开始几分钟内

2548
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,633
杀死了350名恐怖分子 

2549
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,400
当然 以色列随后进行的行动

2550
01:09:21,433 --> 01:09:23,833
被国际特赦组织称为

2551
01:09:24,966 --> 01:09:26,866
加沙的22天的死亡与破坏 

2552
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:30,733
杀死了约1400名巴勒斯坦人 其中大约80%是平民 

2553
01:09:33,933 --> 01:09:37,066
所以 当你听到有人谈论10月7日 

2554
01:09:37,566 --> 01:09:42,466
人们说哈马斯必须被摧毁 

2555
01:09:42,533 --> 01:09:48,333
因为它违反了停火协议并犯下了可怕的暴行 

2556
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:52,366
我不认为有什么理由不能将同样的论点应用于

2557
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,466
以色列及其在铸铅行动开始时所做的事情 

2558
01:09:55,533 --> 01:09:57,400
不仅仅是铸铅行动 

2559
01:09:57,433 --> 01:09:59,300
还有2012年的防御支柱行动 

2560
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:08,133
还有2014年的行动 

2561
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,900
我想继续讨论一下

2562
01:10:12,966 --> 01:10:15,600
我们迄今听到的一些评论 

2563
01:10:17,133 --> 01:10:22,100
其实 我只是想研究一下--我不会把你也扯进来的 

2564
01:10:22,133 --> 01:10:25,233
穆因--政府和人民之间的关系 

2565
01:10:25,466 --> 01:10:28,100
在中东 在我看来 

2566
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:35,433
不管海湾地区的专制国家 

2567
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,500
和绝对君主制等进行什么操作

2568
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:39,866
它们之间的关系都是相互依存的 

2569
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,200
这些国家和政府与西方的关系

2570
01:10:43,266 --> 01:10:45,866
与街头的阿拉伯人之间的距离

2571
01:10:45,933 --> 01:10:49,966
是如此之远 

2572
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,033
这些国家和政府需要在

2573
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:58,433
阿拉伯人对巴勒斯坦和巴勒斯坦人的感情

2574
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,600
以及什么可能适合那些掌权者之间找到平衡 

2575
01:11:02,033 --> 01:11:06,533
是的 我的意思是 

2576
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:11,066
我们经常被告知 

2577
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:24,266
我们经常被告知阿拉伯世界没有民主 

2578
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:30,233
因为某种落后的文化 落后的宗教 落后和偏见 

2579
01:11:32,066 --> 01:11:33,833
好吧 我们来举个例子 

2580
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:37,300
巴勒斯坦人 你甚至不需要去阿拉伯世界 

2581
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:46,266
你有一个由西方支持和支撑的巴勒斯坦权力机构 

2582
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:51,833
其合法性在其自身人民中正好相反 

2583
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,200
它在自己人民中的信誉

2584
01:11:55,233 --> 01:11:58,033
和合法性越低 

2585
01:11:58,066 --> 01:12:01,700
得到的西方支持就越多…

2586
01:12:01,733 --> 01:12:08,033
它实际上是由以色列和西方支撑起来的 

2587
01:12:08,066 --> 01:12:15,966
当然 你知道 这些并不是阿拉伯世界缺乏民主的唯一原因 

2588
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,100
但它们绝对是任何分析的核心 

2589
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:25,600
还说 哦 阿拉伯人只是想把自己的弊端归咎于西方 

2590
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,533
再来看看巴勒斯坦的例子 

2591
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:32,000
2006 年 巴勒斯坦人举行了一次选举

2592
01:12:32,766 --> 01:12:37,333
我相信 卡特中心已对此进行了认证 

2593
01:12:37,966 --> 01:12:40,400
不仅完全自由公正 而且我认为

2594
01:12:40,433 --> 01:12:47,833
是卡特中心所监督的所有选举中最自由公正的一次 

2595
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:53,000
不管人们怎么看待哈马斯 

2596
01:12:53,033 --> 01:12:57,133
哈马斯在那次选举中赢得了胜利 

2597
01:12:57,166 --> 01:12:59,333
而西方的反应是实施封锁 

2598
01:12:59,366 --> 01:13:02,033
实施封锁 妖魔化 

2599
01:13:02,066 --> 01:13:04,800
去合法化 以及对加沙地带的

2600
01:13:04,833 --> 01:13:07,566
反复军事袭击 

2601
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:13,233
正是这些行动导致了我们今天正在经历的

2602
01:13:13,266 --> 01:13:18,900
对加沙地带巴勒斯坦人的种族灭绝性攻击 

2603
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:22,566
所以 别跟我说什么

2604
01:13:22,633 --> 01:13:25,366
西方正在寻找民主伙伴 

2605
01:13:26,233 --> 01:13:29,600
每当出现一丝民主伙伴的迹象时 

2606
01:13:29,633 --> 01:13:30,733
他就被消灭了 

2607
01:13:30,733 --> 01:13:34,233
我只想读一下库尔特文章中的一段话 

2608
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:38,633
他引用了希拉里-克林顿担任参议员时的一段话

2609
01:13:39,066 --> 01:13:41,533
如果我们要推动选举 

2610
01:13:41,566 --> 01:13:43,933
我们就应该确定谁会获胜 

2611
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:45,366
准确无误 

2612
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:50,900
我想继续沃尔特和穆因的工作 

2613
01:13:59,166 --> 01:14:01,966
在我看来 显然我们可以对此有不同意见 

2614
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:06,566
当你对他人的行为进行道德评判时 

2615
01:14:08,033 --> 01:14:14,100
在我看来 你还必须审视在作出决策的背景下

2616
01:14:14,133 --> 01:14:17,166
有哪些可用的选择 

2617
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:27,200
正如穆因所指出的 对加沙实施了一次残酷的封锁 

2618
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:31,400
它实际上始于1991年 

2619
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:35,033
从那时起就开始封锁了 

2620
01:14:35,366 --> 01:14:38,100
然后在2006年哈马斯赢得选举后升级 

2621
01:14:38,133 --> 01:14:41,400
并在2007年再次升级 

2622
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:49,900
在那时 封锁的残酷过程开始了 

2623
01:14:49,933 --> 01:14:57,700
这使得加沙变成了经济学家所称的“人类垃圾堆” 

2624
01:14:58,266 --> 01:15:00,233
现在 加沙有200万人 

2625
01:15:00,266 --> 01:15:03,400
其中70%是1948年及其后裔的难民 

2626
01:15:06,833 --> 01:15:09,733
其中一半是儿童 超过一百万的儿童 

2627
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,700
他们由于封锁的结果 

2628
01:15:13,666 --> 01:15:17,200
再次引用这个说法 

2629
01:15:17,233 --> 01:15:20,766
变成了“人类垃圾堆” 

2630
01:15:22,566 --> 01:15:27,800
这就是所谓的社会经济背景 

2631
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,400
没有人能进去 也没有人能出来 

2632
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:38,300
10 月 7 日冲破加沙大门的大多数年轻人

2633
01:15:38,366 --> 01:15:41,200
都出生在那个垃圾堆里 

2634
01:15:41,266 --> 01:15:44,333
生活在那个垃圾堆里 

2635
01:15:44,366 --> 01:15:47,433
10月6日的情况也是如此 

2636
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,766
他们会死在垃圾堆里 

2637
01:15:53,433 --> 01:15:55,466
这就是社会经济背景 

2638
01:15:56,566 --> 01:16:00,000
现在 库尔特对政治背景进行了补充 

2639
01:16:01,266 --> 01:16:04,900
在此期间 哈马斯曾多次试图

2640
01:16:04,933 --> 01:16:09,333
通过外交途径解决冲突 

2641
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:11,966
他们的建议完美吗？

2642
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:12,300
不

2643
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,933
他们是否需要进行大量的

2644
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,400
激烈谈判才能达成和解？

2645
01:16:18,766 --> 01:16:23,066
在我看来 是的 但肯定有合理的建议 

2646
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:27,400
它们是试图通过外交途径解决冲突的基础 

2647
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:32,500
所有这些外交提议都被断然拒绝了 

2648
01:16:32,533 --> 01:16:36,966
甚至没有被承认为提议 

2649
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,233
那么 现在巴勒斯坦人还剩下什么选择？

2650
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,400
有一个选择 我不得不尴尬地承认 

2651
01:16:47,433 --> 01:16:52,833
我曾在几年的所有演讲中推广这个选择 

2652
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:58,666
我认为非暴力的公民抵抗的可能性和选择是可行的 

2653
01:17:00,566 --> 01:17:05,633
2018年3月30日 这是一个民众倡议 

2654
01:17:05,666 --> 01:17:08,933
最初并不是由哈马斯发起的 

2655
01:17:08,966 --> 01:17:11,233
这是一个民众倡议 

2656
01:17:11,266 --> 01:17:17,333
他们尝试了非暴力的公民抵抗 称为“大返回游行” 

2657
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:20,600
联合国有一份很好的报告 

2658
01:17:20,633 --> 01:17:23,766
报告长达 250 页 单行距 

2659
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,733
即使按照联合国的标准 

2660
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:28,066
也是非常详尽的 

2661
01:17:28,466 --> 01:17:32,000
虽然没有戈德斯通报告那么大 但它是一份非常重要的报告 

2662
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,300
这是一份非常详细的报告 

2663
01:17:41,766 --> 01:17:45,433
该报告用了很大篇幅来描述

2664
01:17:45,466 --> 01:17:51,600
"回归大游行 "中 那些游行者的遭遇 

2665
01:17:54,766 --> 01:17:58,266
仅提供关键事实 首先 

2666
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:02,600
他们描述游行的开始 人们将会记得 

2667
01:18:02,633 --> 01:18:05,100
一开始 这是一个喜庆的节日 

2668
01:18:05,133 --> 01:18:12,700
有唱歌的 有跳舞的 还有类似马戏团的表演 

2669
01:18:12,733 --> 01:18:19,966
人们对这一前景的可能性和潜力充满热情 

2670
01:18:19,966 --> 01:18:22,266
以色列做了什么？

2671
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:26,366
它将最好的狙击手一字排开 

2672
01:18:28,366 --> 01:18:32,233
这是加沙周边最好的狙击手 

2673
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:38,433
然后 报告详细介绍了

2674
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:41,833
这些狙击手的所作所为 

2675
01:18:42,766 --> 01:18:47,200
他们援引以色列政府的话说

2676
01:18:47,233 --> 01:18:52,600
每一颗子弹都落在了预定地点 

2677
01:18:54,100 --> 01:19:00,033
这里不存在像 WCK 那样的失误和错误 

2678
01:19:02,466 --> 01:19:05,800
每颗子弹都落在了预定的地方 明白吗？

2679
01:19:08,033 --> 01:19:13,600
因此 报告说以色列有条不紊 

2680
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:19,233
有计划 有预谋地设置了狙击手 

2681
01:19:19,833 --> 01:19:27,300
它以儿童为目标 

2682
01:19:27,333 --> 01:19:34,800
以医务人员为目标 以记者为目标 

2683
01:19:35,433 --> 01:19:42,066
它针对的是残疾人 它针对的是双截肢者 

2684
01:19:42,133 --> 01:19:46,333
它针对的是坐在轮椅中的人

2685
01:19:46,333 --> 01:19:52,500
他瞄准了距离边界围栏300米的

2686
01:19:52,533 --> 01:19:58,700
拄着拐杖的人 

2687
01:19:58,733 --> 01:20:06,366
现在任何了解非暴力的人都知道 

2688
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:15,233
作为一种斗争方法 

2689
01:20:16,066 --> 01:20:20,866
它只有在引发旁观者 非参与者

2690
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:27,400
作为施暴者或受害者的反应时才能奏效 

2691
01:20:28,166 --> 01:20:32,733
马丁·路德·金的非暴力运动的全部意义在于 

2692
01:20:32,766 --> 01:20:39,333
他说如果我们展示这个系统中根深蒂固的暴力 

2693
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:45,966
我们就能唤起同情 

2694
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:52,400
并引发联邦政府和北方的行动 

2695
01:20:53,233 --> 01:20:57,433
要想展示这一制度中根深蒂固的暴力 

2696
01:20:57,466 --> 01:21:00,666
唯一的办法就是走出去示威 

2697
01:21:01,466 --> 01:21:06,400
他们会带着狗出来 带着消防水龙带出来 

2698
01:21:06,433 --> 01:21:08,633
有时还会带着枪出来 

2699
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:11,400
然后人们应该做出反应 

2700
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,733
如果我们的联邦政府不做出反应 

2701
01:21:16,766 --> 01:21:21,233
如果北方不做出反应 那么所有人都会死 

2702
01:21:22,766 --> 01:21:25,766
非暴力是死路一条 

2703
01:21:25,766 --> 01:21:29,700
而事实上 当以色列把儿童 医护人员 

2704
01:21:29,733 --> 01:21:34,766
记者和残疾人作为攻击目标时 却没有人做出反应 

2705
01:21:34,766 --> 01:21:40,900
我不得不承认 连巴勒斯坦团结运动都没有做出反应 

2706
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:45,766
所以我不得不尴尬地说 我之后感到羞愧 

2707
01:21:45,833 --> 01:21:50,700
因为我曾与一些有职位的人保持联系 

2708
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,233
我是那个提出建议的人 

2709
01:21:54,166 --> 01:21:57,000
但那完全是彻底的失败 

2710
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,966
所以我说 我们来到了 10 月 6 日的夜晚 

2711
01:22:06,366 --> 01:22:08,333
外交 行不通 

2712
01:22:09,766 --> 01:22:13,466
非暴力的公民抵抗是行不通的 

2713
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,666
我愿意接受穆因的话 

2714
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,566
因为他的知识比我渊博得多 

2715
01:22:19,266 --> 01:22:22,466
他说 沙特的协议并不会真正发生 

2716
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:27,333
但我确信穆因会同意我的看法 很多人认为它会发生 

2717
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,366
因此他们认为

2718
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,966
整个阿拉伯-以色列冲突会在

2719
01:22:36,366 --> 01:22:38,666
加沙人民的头颅上得到解决 

2720
01:22:40,533 --> 01:22:43,200
海湾国家 沙特 

2721
01:22:43,266 --> 01:22:45,933
以色列和美国之间会永远幸福美满 

2722
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:50,733
加沙人民 他们将在集中营里

2723
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:55,333
受尽折磨 走向死亡 

2724
01:22:56,066 --> 01:22:58,200
这就是他们的命运和未来 

2725
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:08,066
除非有人能向我展示他们没有利用的选项 

2726
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:14,566
否则在那时他们还有什么选择 

2727
01:23:15,766 --> 01:23:20,533
我个人承认

2728
01:23:20,566 --> 01:23:26,033
在10月7日发生了重大暴行 

2729
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:37,233
但我个人发现很难谴责10月7日发生的事情 

2730
01:23:37,266 --> 01:23:42,166
即使我承认有暴行发生 

2731
01:23:43,966 --> 01:23:46,300
好吧 稍等一下 

2732
01:23:46,666 --> 01:23:51,700
因为我们大概还有20分钟 我想把讨论交给观众 

2733
01:23:51,733 --> 01:23:54,766
我会给你机会回应 斯拉沃热 

2734
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,766
我真的看不到我们身上的灯光 

2735
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:00,900
但是是的 我可以 如果你们举手 那就太好了 

2736
01:24:02,233 --> 01:24:03,800
是的 你们太害羞了 

2737
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:06,333
那边有一个吗？

2738
01:24:06,866 --> 01:24:07,366
你能站起来吗？

2739
01:24:07,933 --> 01:24:08,666
当然 

2740
01:24:10,566 --> 01:24:11,566
对不起 有人吗？

2741
01:24:11,766 --> 01:24:12,600
请起立

2742
01:24:12,733 --> 01:24:13,500
有麦克风吗？

2743
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:14,333
你有麦克风吗？

2744
01:24:14,366 --> 01:24:14,866
这重要吗？

2745
01:24:15,566 --> 01:24:16,966
我认为 如果你谈论它 

2746
01:24:17,766 --> 01:24:18,300
你好 谢谢 

2747
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:23,000
我想回到以色列的政治问题上来 

2748
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,200
所以你谈到了右派 中右派和极右派 

2749
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:31,066
我的意思是 我们也看到了一种

2750
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:33,900
反对内塔尼亚胡的抗议运动正在增长 

2751
01:24:33,933 --> 01:24:35,600
目的是让人质回家 

2752
01:24:35,633 --> 01:24:37,766
但这并没有太多提及巴勒斯坦人 

2753
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:40,333
你知道 我认为完全没有 

2754
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:42,100
如果有的话 也是很少 

2755
01:24:43,166 --> 01:24:50,333
我想问的是 如果我们假设支持巴勒斯坦的全球运动继续增长 

2756
01:24:50,366 --> 01:24:55,466
而以色列内部的运动也许也以某种方式增长 

2757
01:24:55,533 --> 01:24:58,500
但却是以一种真正巩固一个

2758
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:03,200
不那么极右翼的以色列的方式增长的话 

2759
01:25:05,066 --> 01:25:06,033
你会怎么做？

2760
01:25:06,466 --> 01:25:11,600
你如何处理这七百万以色列人口的问题 

2761
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:17,033
他们似乎拒绝接受

2762
01:25:17,633 --> 01:25:20,100
他们的社会存在

2763
01:25:20,166 --> 01:25:23,066
根本性的压迫和错误？

2764
01:25:24,566 --> 01:25:26,266
这是专门向某个人提问的么？

2765
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,500
我的意思是 诺曼 

2766
01:25:27,533 --> 01:25:29,900
我很想听听你的想法 还有其他人的看法 

2767
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:30,433
当然 

2768
01:25:31,433 --> 01:25:32,966
我更愿意先听穆因的意见 

2769
01:25:37,533 --> 01:25:41,833
我认为这个社会的问题

2770
01:25:42,766 --> 01:25:49,966
你可以把它想象成一个在瓷器店里横冲直撞的被宠坏的孩子 

2771
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:53,600
而店主没有要求孩子的父母

2772
01:25:53,633 --> 01:25:56,500
支付损坏瓷器的费用 

2773
01:25:56,533 --> 01:25:59,700
反而告诉父母这个孩子有多可爱 

2774
01:25:59,733 --> 01:26:02,900
并请他们再多打碎一些 

2775
01:26:04,933 --> 01:26:11,066
我认为我们需要对以色列社会表现出一些理解 

2776
01:26:12,266 --> 01:26:16,800
如果你被允许逍遥法外这么久 

2777
01:26:16,833 --> 01:26:21,366
如果完全的豁免是默认设置 

2778
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:27,800
你不能真的期望这个社会会有不同的行为 

2779
01:26:27,833 --> 01:26:32,733
人们谈论以色列的和平运动有多么小 

2780
01:26:32,766 --> 01:26:37,666
虽然它确实非常小 

2781
01:26:37,666 --> 01:26:41,233
但从某种意义上说 

2782
01:26:41,266 --> 01:26:44,833
这本身就是一个奇迹 

2783
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:47,833
考虑到这个社会与其西方支持者的关系

2784
01:26:47,866 --> 01:26:52,066
以及它在对待巴勒斯坦人民时所享有的绝对豁免权 

2785
01:26:52,066 --> 01:26:54,433
包括种族灭绝 

2786
01:26:55,266 --> 01:27:03,233
即使是这一点 也得到了西方的积极支持 

2787
01:27:03,566 --> 01:27:06,433
因此 就你所说的这些抗议活动而言 

2788
01:27:06,466 --> 01:27:09,333
你知道 在 10 月 7 日之前 

2789
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,933
曾有过一场声势浩大的抗议运动 

2790
01:27:11,933 --> 01:27:14,466
反对内塔尼亚胡政府的立法议程 

2791
01:27:16,066 --> 01:27:16,833
司法改革？

2792
01:27:17,366 --> 01:27:19,000
没错 就是所谓的司法改革 

2793
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,866
那个抗议运动的领导人积极阻止任何

2794
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:26,266
关于以色列-巴勒斯坦关系的讨论 

2795
01:27:26,333 --> 01:27:28,533
用这个委婉语来说 

2796
01:27:28,566 --> 01:27:30,766
将其排除在抗议运动之外 

2797
01:27:32,133 --> 01:27:39,400
现在 抗议仅仅是为了反对政府与哈马斯达成协议 

2798
01:27:39,433 --> 01:27:42,266
以便释放被俘人员 

2799
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:45,466
但除此之外 据我所知 

2800
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,766
抗议运动并没有一个政治议程

2801
01:27:48,466 --> 01:27:52,200
来改变以色列-巴勒斯坦关系的性质 

2802
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:57,700
因此 如果你想改变以色列社会 就不要盯着以色列 

2803
01:27:58,666 --> 01:28:01,633
看看那些支持以色列的人 

2804
01:28:01,633 --> 01:28:05,066
还有那些教导以色列社会什么都可以做 

2805
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:07,200
甚至包括种族灭绝的人 

2806
01:28:07,766 --> 01:28:11,066
根本问题在于 永远不会有问责 

2807
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:14,400
免责成为默认状态 

2808
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:18,466
诺曼 你之前提到的查克·舒默的评论

2809
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:21,900
不也是一个问题吗？

2810
01:28:21,966 --> 01:28:24,666
这种普遍的看法认为 

2811
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:27,400
只要把内塔尼亚胡赶下台 

2812
01:28:27,733 --> 01:28:31,000
情况就会好转 

2813
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:36,633
但却没有考虑到以色列根深蒂固的结构性观点 

2814
01:28:37,066 --> 01:28:40,433
以及以色列人的意识和心理 

2815
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:45,333
这里有几个评论要说 

2816
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:50,333
首先 我完全同意你的看法 这不仅仅是内塔尼亚胡的战争 

2817
01:28:50,366 --> 01:28:53,033
就像这不仅仅是普京的战争一样 

2818
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:57,433
在两者的情况下 这都是精英阶层的共识 

2819
01:28:57,466 --> 01:29:00,866
不仅仅是内塔尼亚胡一个人的决定 

2820
01:29:03,833 --> 01:29:07,366
就以色列而言 我不太愿意谈俄罗斯 

2821
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,866
因为我不了解民众的情绪 

2822
01:29:10,433 --> 01:29:12,000
就俄罗斯而言 是整个国家 

2823
01:29:12,033 --> 01:29:14,200
不好意思 就以色列而言 是整个社会 

2824
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:16,966
如果你看民意调查数据 

2825
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,333
大约90%的以色列人认为 或者88%

2826
01:29:21,166 --> 01:29:25,666
认为以色列使用了足够的武力或不足的武力 

2827
01:29:25,666 --> 01:29:30,833
大约40%的人认为以色列在加沙使用的武力不足 

2828
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:33,566
只有大约12%的人

2829
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,266
对以色列的所作所为有不同看法 

2830
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:39,200
所以我不同意 我同意你的看法 

2831
01:29:39,266 --> 01:29:41,200
我认为把这描述为内塔尼亚胡的战争是不正确的 

2832
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:44,733
我也不认为舒默参议员的说法是准确的 

2833
01:29:44,766 --> 01:29:48,133
好像如果有选举 

2834
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,700
有一个更好的人选 

2835
01:29:50,733 --> 01:29:53,066
也许是甘茨 他在竞选时

2836
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:56,400
就是以他在2014年对加沙造成的破坏作为竞选纲领的 

2837
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,633
那是他的竞选视频 

2838
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:04,700
所以我不能说我对这一点乐观 

2839
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:10,433
认为这只是内塔尼亚胡和少数几个人的问题 

2840
01:30:11,466 --> 01:30:16,600
我要说的是 虽然我并不乐意这么说 但我认为现在试图改变

2841
01:30:16,966 --> 01:30:19,933
以色列人的态度是徒劳的 

2842
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,966
就像在民权运动期间

2843
01:30:23,433 --> 01:30:27,066
试图改变南方白人的态度是徒劳的一样 

2844
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:32,166
它需要外部力量 

2845
01:30:32,233 --> 01:30:37,300
包括引入联邦军队来取消南方的种族隔离 

2846
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:40,233
在南方 有少数白人

2847
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:42,966
对正在发生的事情有所保留 

2848
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:46,300
他们真诚地反对 但只是极少数 

2849
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:51,233
我不认为你可以期望

2850
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:55,133
改变所有穆因所描述的那些原因 

2851
01:30:55,166 --> 01:30:59,966
他没有提到意识形态方面的内容 

2852
01:31:00,033 --> 01:31:05,800
这是一种致命的结合 包括犹太人劣等感

2853
01:31:06,333 --> 01:31:11,766
和我们的劣等感——实际上是我们的动物性 

2854
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:15,033
而不是劣等感——还有这些

2855
01:31:16,933 --> 01:31:20,966
不同层次的意识形态的丑恶 

2856
01:31:21,033 --> 01:31:26,333
使得要改变以色列人的态度非常困难 

2857
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:29,533
我得说 因为我想公正地看待这些事情 

2858
01:31:29,566 --> 01:31:32,000
可以说有两个 

2859
01:31:32,466 --> 01:31:37,666
在20世纪非常丑陋的历史中 可以说上帝创造的地球上

2860
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:41,233
最种族主义和帝国主义的两个国家是

2861
01:31:41,266 --> 01:31:43,066
1930年代的德国和日本 

2862
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,533
他们在二战期间犯下的罪行

2863
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:51,700
简直是十足的暴行 

2864
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:54,000
我们都知道德国人的罪行 

2865
01:31:54,033 --> 01:31:57,166
而日本人杀害了大约2600万中国人 

2866
01:31:57,666 --> 01:32:02,633
这是日本人在亚洲发动的一场非常丑陋的战争 

2867
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:11,500
但国家变了 德国变了 日本也变了 

2868
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:15,266
所以我不相信这些原罪的概念 

2869
01:32:16,666 --> 01:32:23,933
但我同意 我已经开始同意莫琳的观点 

2870
01:32:23,966 --> 01:32:31,233
即有必要对以色列社会进行认真的改革 

2871
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:37,100
如何发生 如何展开 我也说不清楚 

2872
01:32:37,966 --> 01:32:41,700
但它现在真的是个丑陋的地方 

2873
01:32:41,733 --> 01:32:46,333
而且已经丑陋了很久 

2874
01:32:47,266 --> 01:32:49,866
我得承认 

2875
01:32:49,933 --> 01:32:52,533
当我读到现在的报道时 这些报道

2876
01:32:52,866 --> 01:32:58,400
现在 现在 针对以色列 这真的太可怕了 

2877
01:33:00,433 --> 01:33:02,900
以色列把自己置于这样的境地 

2878
01:33:04,433 --> 01:33:11,900
以色列把自己置于这样的境地 我天性上总是支持弱者 

2879
01:33:11,966 --> 01:33:19,433
我几乎为它对自己所做的一切感到难过 因为这真的很可怕 

2880
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:24,600
而这些人 他们甚至不知道自己做了什么 

2881
01:33:25,466 --> 01:33:27,100
这就像是对堕胎的声明 

2882
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:31,166
也许整个想法从一开始就是错的 

2883
01:33:31,233 --> 01:33:34,366
也许一开始就是错的

2884
01:33:34,633 --> 01:33:37,633
但是 美国一开始就有很多问题 

2885
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:42,366
美国找到了一种方法 

2886
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:49,066
虽然它并没有让这里变得伟大 但确实需要消灭原住民 

2887
01:33:49,133 --> 01:33:52,466
你不能忘记这一点 

2888
01:33:52,466 --> 01:33:55,800
但美国似乎有某种自我改革的能力 

2889
01:33:56,733 --> 01:34:01,966
而我不知道以色列该怎么办 

2890
01:34:02,933 --> 01:34:04,533
让我们再问几个问题 

2891
01:34:05,433 --> 01:34:05,833
我确定

2892
01:34:06,766 --> 01:34:08,833
后面举起了一只手

2893
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:12,300
是的 我想跟进一下 

2894
01:34:12,533 --> 01:34:15,633
我的意思是 伊兰-庞贝谈到了

2895
01:34:15,666 --> 01:34:18,766
特拉维夫的以色列和中央的以色列 

2896
01:34:19,666 --> 01:34:22,000
我的意思是 在巴勒斯坦问题上 

2897
01:34:22,033 --> 01:34:24,366
以色列是一个非常团结的社会 

2898
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:27,633
但从内部看 这是一个极端两极分化的社会 

2899
01:34:28,666 --> 01:34:31,800
以色列人认为自己生活在一个高度两极分化的社会中 

2900
01:34:33,133 --> 01:34:36,233
我认为 如果你了解以色列人 

2901
01:34:36,266 --> 01:34:39,366
特别是特拉维夫的以色列人 

2902
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:42,500
自10月7日以来 尤其是2023年 

2903
01:34:42,533 --> 01:34:45,633
你会听到这样的想法：

2904
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:51,033
在特拉维夫的以色列中 有一种想法是 

2905
01:34:51,066 --> 01:34:56,600
我们可以把巴勒斯坦问题边缘化 不需要解决它 

2906
01:34:56,633 --> 01:35:01,666
我们可以继续生活在一个看似正常的社会里 

2907
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:05,700
在特拉维夫的咖啡馆里吃羊角面包 

2908
01:35:08,266 --> 01:35:12,433
2023年 首先是所谓的民主危机 

2909
01:35:12,466 --> 01:35:15,400
然后是10月7日的事件 

2910
01:35:16,266 --> 01:35:20,566
在整个特拉维夫的以色列社会中 

2911
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:29,000
对在以色列生活的未来失去了投资信心 

2912
01:35:29,033 --> 01:35:34,500
突然之间 很多人开始说这里没有未来了 

2913
01:35:34,533 --> 01:35:38,566
我们将不断生活在来自哈马斯 真主党

2914
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:46,100
和伊朗的暴力威胁之下 而这些人原本是那种人道 

2915
01:35:46,133 --> 01:35:51,300
自由 开明的以色列的世界大使 对吗？

2916
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,933
我的意思是说 

2917
01:35:53,966 --> 01:35:56,966
这些人都是有良好教育的专业人士和知识分子 

2918
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,400
他们参加会议 并把自己说成是

2919
01:35:59,466 --> 01:36:02,566
生活在一个正常的国与国之间的国家 

2920
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:09,066
在那些人中存在一种大规模的运动 

2921
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:13,266
即对国家项目的撤资 

2922
01:36:15,633 --> 01:36:20,166
很多人说要离开 也有很多人说要搬回欧洲 

2923
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:24,733
这也开始发生了 这是一个特定的问题 

2924
01:36:24,766 --> 01:36:28,933
我的意思是评论真的非常有趣 是的 

2925
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,166
所以问题只是你认为这是一个主要因素 

2926
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,333
因为我知道人们说 

2927
01:36:35,366 --> 01:36:41,800
我的意思是以色列社会在巴勒斯坦人的问题上已经无法改革 

2928
01:36:41,866 --> 01:36:44,866
但你认为这是一个重要的推动因素 

2929
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:47,833
是的 未来的事件 

2930
01:36:48,533 --> 01:36:49,700
先生 你要接这个话题吗？

2931
01:36:50,566 --> 01:36:53,133
不 我想换一个方向 

2932
01:36:53,566 --> 01:36:53,833
好的

2933
01:36:54,466 --> 01:36:55,466
我能简单回答一下吗？

2934
01:36:55,566 --> 01:36:56,266
请说吧

2935
01:36:56,600 --> 01:37:03,566
这就是说 我不会假装比你更了解这个问题 

2936
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:07,433
假设你的观察是正确的 

2937
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:12,666
我认为这使问题变得比看上去更加复杂 

2938
01:37:13,433 --> 01:37:17,900
因为这涉及到自我改革的能力 

2939
01:37:19,966 --> 01:37:20,800
根本就不存在 

2940
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:25,300
我看到其他人的手也在举 

2941
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:30,033
我只想问小组成员一个问题 

2942
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:34,500
您认为这场冲突

2943
01:37:34,533 --> 01:37:38,833
在该地区蔓延的可能性有多大？

2944
01:37:39,266 --> 01:37:45,400
以色列是否有兴趣扩大这场冲突？

2945
01:37:46,133 --> 01:37:47,900
穆欣 你在 MC 中提到了这一点 

2946
01:37:48,166 --> 01:37:49,100
你能重复一下问题吗？

2947
01:37:49,466 --> 01:37:50,133
是的 当然 

2948
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:56,066
地区战争升级符合以色列的利益吗？

2949
01:37:56,833 --> 01:37:58,966
这种可能性有多大？

2950
01:37:59,733 --> 01:38:04,833
我认为以色列希望地区冲突升级 

2951
01:38:04,866 --> 01:38:11,000
因为它看到了将美国直接卷入冲突的机会

2952
01:38:11,566 --> 01:38:16,900
从以色列的角度来看 伊朗与其对手之间的冲突

2953
01:38:16,933 --> 01:38:22,266
是以色列挑起伊朗-美国直接对抗的理想局面 

2954
01:38:22,966 --> 01:38:27,300
我只想简单说一下 你知道伊朗最近袭击了--

2955
01:38:27,333 --> 01:38:31,666
对不起 是以色列袭击了伊朗驻大马士革领事馆 

2956
01:38:32,633 --> 01:38:38,333
显然 伊朗人已经向美国人发出信息 

2957
01:38:38,366 --> 01:38:43,066
如果美国人成功实现永久停火 

2958
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:46,333
换句话说 结束以色列

2959
01:38:46,366 --> 01:38:49,466
在加沙地带的战争 

2960
01:38:50,333 --> 01:38:53,800
那么 对伊朗人来说 这件事就结束了 

2961
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:58,066
如果美国人失败了 

2962
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:01,500
那么伊朗人已经决定 为了威慑以色列 

2963
01:39:01,533 --> 01:39:05,733
他们将直接对以色列领土发动攻击 

2964
01:39:05,766 --> 01:39:12,600
不是通过他们的同盟民兵 而是直接从伊朗领土发动攻击 

2965
01:39:12,733 --> 01:39:15,000
因此 换句话说 

2966
01:39:15,066 --> 01:39:17,333
如果美国人做出不结束战争的选择 

2967
01:39:17,366 --> 01:39:19,200
这将是一个政策决定 

2968
01:39:19,233 --> 01:39:21,400
而伊朗人则会继续威胁 

2969
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:24,800
我们可能会看到一个非常重要的

2970
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:34,333
我只想重申我之前说过的话 

2971
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:41,866
如果美国强制执行永久停火 

2972
01:39:41,933 --> 01:39:46,533
以换取伊朗不采取任何报复行动 

2973
01:39:46,566 --> 01:39:51,166
那么问题是

2974
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:55,000
哈马斯将能够宣布胜利 

2975
01:39:56,366 --> 01:39:57,900
但以色列不会接受这一点 

2976
01:39:58,733 --> 01:40:03,800
以色列决心取得绝对 明确 

2977
01:40:03,833 --> 01:40:08,900
彻底的胜利 让哈马斯彻底失败 

2978
01:40:11,933 --> 01:40:13,500
这就是第二个问题 

2979
01:40:14,466 --> 01:40:17,233
目前 由于真主党的影响 

2980
01:40:17,266 --> 01:40:21,433
以色列北部约有 10 万人流离失所 

2981
01:40:22,566 --> 01:40:25,800
以色列对此也不满意 

2982
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:28,866
它会给真主党放行吗？

2983
01:40:30,266 --> 01:40:34,033
我个人认为 但我们可以有不同意见 

2984
01:40:34,066 --> 01:40:37,833
他比我更清楚 我个人是不相信的 

2985
01:40:37,833 --> 01:40:45,333
还有第三个问题 也就是库尔特提到的问题 

2986
01:40:45,366 --> 01:40:49,466
打破永久停火非常容易 

2987
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:53,766
你们可以同意永久停火 以色列也可以同意永久停火 

2988
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:56,666
正如库尔特在 2008 年 6 月指出的那样 

2989
01:40:58,566 --> 01:41:01,566
然后 当以色列想要战争时 就挑衅 

2990
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:04,600
挑衅 再挑衅 然后就有了战争 

2991
01:41:04,633 --> 01:41:07,033
每个人都忘记了是谁挑衅 

2992
01:41:07,066 --> 01:41:10,666
正如米尔肯所说 这本身就是一种防御 

2993
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,866
因此 就我个人而言 

2994
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:19,100
我不认为任何宣布的永久停火有任何意义或价值 

2995
01:41:19,166 --> 01:41:20,866
因为纵观历史 

2996
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,933
停火很容易被打破 

2997
01:41:23,533 --> 01:41:25,500
我能问一下科尔特

2998
01:41:25,533 --> 01:41:27,866
关于诺曼的观点吗？

2999
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:29,966
关于以色列一次又一次宣布

3000
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,033
要彻底消灭哈马斯的可行性 

3001
01:41:32,066 --> 01:41:35,466
因为你在你的文章中提到了这一点 

3002
01:41:35,533 --> 01:41:39,433
哈马斯是多方面的 

3003
01:41:39,433 --> 01:41:43,666
它是一个社会运动 是一个民兵组织 

3004
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:47,933
是一个政治运动 也只是一个理念 

3005
01:41:49,533 --> 01:41:52,833
嗯 简短的回答是 

3006
01:41:52,866 --> 01:41:56,800
以色列完全不可能消灭哈马斯 即使

3007
01:41:57,466 --> 01:42:03,466
我们接受——我并不接受——消灭哈马斯

3008
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:11,766
在道德上是无可非议的 但实际上这不会发生 

3009
01:42:11,766 --> 01:42:15,666
哈马斯不仅以加沙地带为基地 

3010
01:42:15,733 --> 01:42:19,633
它的基地遍布被占领土内外 

3011
01:42:19,633 --> 01:42:22,033
此外 即使你能摧毁

3012
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:25,000
哈马斯的军事能力 

3013
01:42:25,033 --> 01:42:26,900
以色列声称 它已经或多或少地消灭了

3014
01:42:26,933 --> 01:42:32,600
哈马斯在加沙地带北部的军事能力 

3015
01:42:32,633 --> 01:42:35,200
即使它入侵拉法 你知道 

3016
01:42:35,233 --> 01:42:40,200
带着辛瓦尔和其他哈马斯领导人被砍下的头颅回来 

3017
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:44,233
它不会对巴勒斯坦人的不满来源

3018
01:42:45,233 --> 01:42:47,833
做出任何改变 我们一直在谈论这一点 

3019
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:50,466
这是显而易见的 

3020
01:42:50,466 --> 01:42:54,700
几十年的占领 种族隔离 屠杀 

3021
01:42:54,733 --> 01:43:00,666
即使从这些灰烬中产生的东西不自称为哈马斯 

3022
01:43:00,733 --> 01:43:03,266
也会是同样的问题 

3023
01:43:03,266 --> 01:43:05,233
我想我们得结束了 

3024
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:07,666
除非有人有紧急问题要问 

3025
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:09,333
有人举手 

3026
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:11,033
我真的看不到房间后面 

3027
01:43:11,066 --> 01:43:12,800
你为什么不问这个问题呢？

3028
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:13,866
我有一个问题 

3029
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:14,500
好的

3030
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:14,633
我是

3031
01:43:14,966 --> 01:43:18,133
我想知道 在你看来 

3032
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:26,500
为什么尼加拉瓜对德国提起诉讼 而不是对美国提起诉讼 

3033
01:43:26,533 --> 01:43:31,966
因为美国似乎是以色列的主要支持者 

3034
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,466
无论是武器支持还是财政支持？

3035
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:40,633
我想是因为尼加拉瓜在中美洲 而德国在欧洲 

3036
01:43:45,333 --> 01:43:46,666
我想直接到房间后面去 

3037
01:43:46,766 --> 01:43:48,200
有一只手举起来了吗？

3038
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,466
不是那个问特拉维夫问题的人 

3039
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,233
因为你已经问过一个问题了 

3040
01:43:52,233 --> 01:43:52,633
对不起 先生 

3041
01:43:55,666 --> 01:43:56,266
在前面 这里 

3042
01:43:58,133 --> 01:44:00,400
对你们任何人来说 

3043
01:44:00,433 --> 01:44:02,700
美国和以色列之间

3044
01:44:03,166 --> 01:44:07,400
那种完全豁免 完全容忍和支持的关系有任何改变的可能吗？

3045
01:44:07,733 --> 01:44:09,733
我的意思是 公众舆论已经发生了很大变化 

3046
01:44:09,966 --> 01:44:12,800
这种情况今后是否有可能发生任何变化 

3047
01:44:12,833 --> 01:44:15,666
哪怕是很小的变化？

3048
01:44:16,033 --> 01:44:17,400
谁想谈一谈这个？

3049
01:44:18,666 --> 01:44:26,700
我认为 诺曼和其他人所谈到的变化

3050
01:44:28,266 --> 01:44:34,900
具有深远的政治意义 

3051
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:38,800
但要让它们对你提出的问题类型产生影响 

3052
01:44:38,866 --> 01:44:43,466
还需要时间 

3053
01:44:43,466 --> 01:44:46,700
如果你问的是短期问题 

3054
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:51,700
我的回答是拜登 布林肯 内塔尼亚胡

3055
01:44:52,633 --> 01:44:56,166
他们不会被追究责任 

3056
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:57,700
他们将逍遥法外 

3057
01:44:57,866 --> 01:45:00,800
不幸的是 世界就是这样运转的 

3058
01:45:00,833 --> 01:45:04,700
但话说回来 林肯的孙子们 

3059
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:09,866
每当他们想研究21世纪加沙的种族灭绝时 

3060
01:45:09,933 --> 01:45:13,066
他们会知道 

3061
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:16,733
任何不将其祖父作为主角的研究

3062
01:45:16,766 --> 01:45:20,100
都是不完整的 

3063
01:45:21,233 --> 01:45:26,000
不幸的是 我认为这可能就是问责的范围 

3064
01:45:26,266 --> 01:45:28,466
卡里姆-汗还在装饰他的圣诞树 

3065
01:45:31,066 --> 01:45:32,700
国际刑事法院不会介入 

3066
01:45:33,766 --> 01:45:37,166
国际法院可以做出明确的裁决 

3067
01:45:37,566 --> 01:45:39,266
但却无法执行 

3068
01:45:40,433 --> 01:45:42,900
国际体系目前的结构方式 

3069
01:45:43,766 --> 01:45:47,000
遗憾的是 

3070
01:45:47,033 --> 01:45:50,266
没有你所要求的问责制或罪犯 

3071
01:45:52,566 --> 01:45:54,633
这是一个多么灰暗的结尾 

3072
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,300
但我们不得不就此结束 

3073
01:45:58,366 --> 01:46:00,400
买这本书并继续讨论吧 

3074
01:46:00,566 --> 01:46:02,866
非常感谢你们的到来 

3075
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:03,833
谢谢 

3076
01:46:04,066 --> 01:46:04,500
谢谢 

3077
01:46:05,233 --> 01:46:05,500
谢谢 

3078
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:05,833
谢谢 

3079
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:06,833
谢谢 

3080
01:46:14,333 --> 01:46:15,600
我还没有对小组成员说谢谢 

3081
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:16,633
我真是太失礼了

3082
01:46:16,866 --> 01:46:19,800
诺曼-芬克尔斯坦 穆恩-拉瓦尼 斯拉沃伊-齐泽克 

3083
01:46:20,133 --> 01:46:21,266
和科尔特·刘易斯 

3084
01:46:21,466 --> 01:46:22,200
非常感谢 

3085
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:22,566
谢谢 

3086
01:46:26,066 --> 01:46:31,733
非常感谢
