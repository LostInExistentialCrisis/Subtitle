1
00:00:24,668 --> 00:00:27,548
That's a hell of a welcome for someone who's going to talk about the Bible.

2
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:40,924
So I thought I would get farther than through Genesis by this point, but I'm not unhappy about the pace either.

3
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:42,808
I've learned a tremendous amount.

4
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:48,427
And so hopefully what we'll do today is finish Genesis completely.

5
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:56,034
And then I think I'll try to start up with Exodus in May, depending on what happens next year.

6
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,310
I have a busy travel schedule, but I would really like to do it.

7
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,128
I really like the Exodus story, and I understand it very well.

8
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:11,009
A lot of the stories in Genesis, especially after the first few stories, say up to the Tower of Babel, I had to do a tremendous amount of learning about, which is really good.

9
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,481
But I do know the Exodus story, so I'm really looking forward to that.

10
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,702
So let's dive right into it and see how far we can get today.

11
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,547
So we'll review first.

12
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:32,015
So Joseph's father is Jacob, and Jacob is the patriarch of Israel essentially, the father of the twelve tribes.

13
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:49,120
We might remember that he had a very morally ambivalent pathway through life, and it's

14
00:01:49,200 --> 00:02:00,637
One of the things that I think is so interesting about the stories in the Old Testament is that these so-called patriarchal figures are very realistic.

15
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,271
It's something that...

16
00:02:02,982 --> 00:02:06,239
I was also being struck by the accounts in the New Testament that way.

17
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:13,996
There's lots of things that Christ does that you'd think would have been edited out over time and sanitized, but they're not.

18
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:22,280
The Old Testament is definitely not a book that's been sanitized. quite interesting that that's the case so you sort of see people with all their

19
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,878
flaws and I've been trying to also derive some general conclusions about

20
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:39,700
the moral of the story of the Genesis stories and because these stories are fundamentally moral and moral as far as I'm concerned has to do with action

21
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:47,740
right because moral decisions are the decisions that you make when you're Restructuring action when you decide to do one thing or another

22
00:02:48,441 --> 00:02:52,539
generally you want to do things that are the best things that you can think of to do and

23
00:02:54,201 --> 00:03:00,506
Hence good, but sometimes you also want to do things that are the worst things you can do you know because you're angry or resentful or bitter and

24
00:03:02,301 --> 00:03:07,920
So the moral decisions that you make that govern your actions are really the most important decisions that you make in your life

25
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:13,540
And it's not that easy to figure out How to make moral decisions we don't have an unerring

26
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:23,500
Technology for that the same way as we do for say making decisions about empirical reality which in some ways seem a lot simpler

27
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:29,614
Partly because we can work collectively at it partly because we have a rigorous methodology for deciding.

28
00:03:29,614 --> 00:03:30,697
What's true, and what's not so

29
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:36,860
One of the things that's really struck me like it's an overarching theme

30
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:42,687
I would say that emerges out of Genesis especially after the really ancient stories say

31
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,100
especially after the stories of Cain and Abel and Noah and

32
00:03:51,322 --> 00:03:56,700
the Tower of Babel when you get to the accounts of the historically

33
00:03:57,845 --> 00:04:02,677
more historically real people one injunction seems to be

34
00:04:04,504 --> 00:04:05,959
Get the hell out there and do something

35
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:12,780
You know what one of the major themes for all of the patriarchs that we've talked about Abraham

36
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:21,790
say, Jacob and Joseph, is move out into the world regardless of the circumstances at hand.

37
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:25,727
Now, that's in the Old Testament stories.

38
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:30,801
That's basically portrayed as hearkening to the voice of God, something like that.

39
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:33,870
Maybe you could think about that as destiny or a psychological calling.

40
00:04:35,894 --> 00:04:40,830
And the funny thing too is that it's not that these people have an easy time of it when they heed that call.

41
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:47,330
So what's what's fascinating is that they often run into extreme difficulties right away?

42
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:54,190
and I think that's very interesting first of all because life is obviously full of extreme difficulties and

43
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:01,890
Second it's another example of the failure to sugarcoat things which is one of the things I think makes a mockery of

44
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,910
anti-religious theories that are even quite sophisticated say like Freud's because Freud thought of religion as a

45
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:16,950
and as a wish fulfillment, essentially, and also Marx, who thought about religion as the opiate of the masses.

46
00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:23,930
If those were true, it seems to me that there'd be a lot more wish, and a lot less reality.

47
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:26,357
A lot less stark, harsh reality.

48
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:30,950
You know, the first thing that Abraham encounters is a famine,

49
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:37,950
and then he has to hide his wife, and then he basically journeys into a tyranny.

50
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:43,830
So that's about as bad as it gets in some ways, and those themes recur continually.

51
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:46,139
And no one ever lives where they're supposed to live.

52
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,910
They live in Canaan and not the Promised Land.

53
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,241
And so it's a pretty rough series of stories.

54
00:05:53,873 --> 00:05:58,950
But the fundamental idea is something like, there's no time for sitting around.

55
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:01,749
There's time to go out into the world and engage.

56
00:06:02,332 --> 00:06:06,950
And then there's hints about the proper and improper ways of engaging.

57
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:16,379
Right, so clearly the improper way to engage is I think most clearly delineated in the Cain and Abel story and with Cain

58
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,110
Exemplifying the inappropriate way to engage with the world and that's to engage

59
00:06:23,472 --> 00:06:27,090
With the world in a bitter jealous and resentful manner

60
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:35,610
Now what are the things that I really like about the Cain and Abel story and that theme recurs Continually with the with the duality of the brothers, right?

61
00:06:35,971 --> 00:06:45,110
There's constant conflict between a perspective that's essentially like Cain's, and the opposite perspective, which I'll get to in a minute.

62
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:54,090
But Cain sees that the world is a very tragic place, and that the rewards are distributed unfairly,

63
00:06:54,573 --> 00:06:57,570
and that there are people who do better and people who do worse,

64
00:06:58,132 --> 00:07:02,590
and as a consequence of that, he becomes bitter and resentful and curses God,

65
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:08,690
and then he becomes homicidal, fratricidal, which is even worse, then he destroys his own ideal,

66
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:12,509
then his descendants basically become genocidal, something like that.

67
00:07:13,273 --> 00:07:16,989
So, that seems to be the wrong way to go about things.

68
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:20,130
You know, unless your goal is to make things worse.

69
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:26,630
Like, it's not like Cain has a limited number of things, has nothing to object to.

70
00:07:26,831 --> 00:07:28,219
He's got plenty to object to.

71
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:30,110
His situation actually is bad.

72
00:07:30,511 --> 00:07:36,570
He's overshadowed terribly by his brother, who everyone loves, who does extraordinarily well, and who's good at everything, and

73
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:46,018
the story is a bit ambivalent about the reasons for Cain's failure, although a fair bit of it's laid at his own feet, but he's definitely failing.

74
00:07:46,018 --> 00:07:53,246
And so you can understand why he would have this terrible attitude, but the problem is all it does is make it worse.

75
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:54,210
So it doesn't seem to be...

76
00:07:55,493 --> 00:08:03,190
One of the things I've also learned as a psychologist, sort of pondering these sorts of things, is it's often a lot easier to identify what you shouldn't do than what you should do.

77
00:08:03,952 --> 00:08:06,799
I think evil is easier to identify than good.

78
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:11,190
I think good is trickier, but evil stands out to some degree.

79
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:20,210
And then at least you can say, if you're trying to get as far away from that as possible, we could even say, just for practical reasons, so your life doesn't become hell and your family life doesn't become hell.

80
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,810
Hell at least you could get as far away from that as possible even if you weren't able to conjure up

81
00:08:26,032 --> 00:08:26,983
What would constitute?

82
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,890
The good as an aim you could at least avoid

83
00:08:30,851 --> 00:08:36,370
Those sorts of pitfalls, and I do also think that it's pitfalls like that that really threaten our society right now

84
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:43,490
You know that I see a tremendous rise in resentment fueling almost all of the political polarization

85
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:50,483
That's taking place and seems unfortunate given that by and by large large, everyone on the planet is richer than they've ever been.

86
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:55,363
Now that doesn't mean there's no disparity, but there's always disparity.

87
00:08:55,363 --> 00:09:09,706
Anyways, Jacob, of course, Jacob and Rebecca deceive Esau, and Jacob ends up with Isaac's blessing, and so that's a moral catastrophe.

88
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:17,881
And then he has to run because his brother wants to kill him, and so that's the fratricidal Motif again, I like that too.

89
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:19,670
I think that's real really realistic

90
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:25,070
You know one of the things that freud noted constantly, and this is where freud really is a genius is that?

91
00:09:26,471 --> 00:09:35,390
The most intense hatreds and also sometimes the most intense love is within families you know and in the freudian world of psychopathology

92
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:41,317
It's all it's all inside the family.

93
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:46,630
In fact, the pathology in the Freudian world is actually the fact that it's all inside the family.

94
00:09:47,031 --> 00:09:56,630
Because people who get tangled up in the Freudian familial nightmare, which is roughly Oedipal in structure, can only conceptualize the world in terms of their familial relationships.

95
00:09:56,851 --> 00:10:03,590
They've been so damaged by the enmeshment and the trauma and the deceit and the betrayal and the blurred lines and all of that,

96
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:08,747
all of that, that they just can't expand past the family and go out in the world.

97
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:19,801
So the idea that brothers can be at each other's throats, I think is, that's a very powerful idea, and it's not something that people like to think about.

98
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:27,385
So Jacob has to leave, and it's not surprising because, I mean, what he did was pretty reprehensible, he betrayed his brother.

99
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:32,465
But nonetheless, he's the person who dreams of the ladder that unites heaven and earth.

100
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,606
And that's a very perverse thing, you know.

101
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,529
But one of the things I think it does is give, in some sense, it gives hope to everyone.

102
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:47,589
Because it isn't, you know, if only the good guys win, we're really in trouble, right?

103
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,322
Because it's not that easy to be a good guy.

104
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,429
It's really not that easy.

105
00:10:51,490 --> 00:11:02,730
And most people are pretty keenly aware of all the ways that they fall short, even of their own ideals and so if there was no hope except for the good guys almost all

106
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:11,710
of us would be lost and so that's one of the things I really liked and was more surprised about with the Old Testament stories is that these people are they

107
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:22,590
have very complex lives and they make very major moral errors by anyone's standard and yet if and yet the overall message is still hopeful and the the

108
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:31,786
The message that runs contrary to the message of evil, say, the message of good, is something like, well, there's a lot of emphasis on faith, right?

109
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:47,167
And that's a tough one, because people who are cynical about religious structures like to think of faith as the willingness to demolish your intellect in the service of superstition.

110
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:57,627
And there's something to be said for that perspective, but not a lot, because the reality is much more sophisticated.

111
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:04,429
Part of the faith that is being insisted upon in the Old Testament is something like, and

112
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:12,053
I'm speaking psychologically here again, that it's useful to posit a high good, to aim at it.

113
00:12:13,251 --> 00:12:15,348
And I really think that's practically useful too.

114
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:20,250
Research we've done with the future authoring program for example indicates pretty clearly that if you get people to

115
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:25,970
Conceptualize an ideal and a balanced ideal you know so what do you want for your family?

116
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,256
What do you want for your career?

117
00:12:27,256 --> 00:12:28,602
What do you want for your education?

118
00:12:28,602 --> 00:12:30,530
What do you want for your character development?

119
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,889
How are you going to use your time outside of work?

120
00:12:35,272 --> 00:12:39,390
How are you going to structure your use of drugs and alcohol in places where you might get impulsive?

121
00:12:39,871 --> 00:12:45,170
How can you avoid falling into a horrible pit if you really think that through and you come up with an integrated ideal?

122
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,889
And you you put it above you as something to reach for then you're more

123
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:57,769
Committed to the world in a positive way, and you're less tormented by anxiety and uncertainty and

124
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:03,870
so and that makes sense right because here you are alive and everything and so

125
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:10,830
Unless you were cape if you're not capable of manifesting some positive relationship with the fact of your being

126
00:13:11,693 --> 00:13:14,150
Then how could that be anything other than hellish?

127
00:13:14,954 --> 00:13:22,370
because you it would just be anxiety provoking and terrible because you're vulnerable and there'd be nothing useful or worthwhile to do well that's just not

128
00:13:23,194 --> 00:13:32,290
I just can't see that as a winning strategy for anyone you can make a rational case for adopting that strategy in that you know you can say well

129
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:41,450
there's no evidence for for a transcendent morality or for an ultimate meaning there's no hard empirical evidence but it seems to me that there's

130
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:45,843
existential evidence, as well, that has to be taken into account.

131
00:13:45,843 --> 00:13:48,410
And of course, psychologists have talked about this a lot.

132
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:53,220
Carl Rogers, for example, and Jung, for that matter, Freud, for that matter.

133
00:13:53,220 --> 00:14:01,370
Most of the great psychologists have pointed out that, you know, you can derive reasonable information that's solid from your own experience,

134
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:11,747
especially if you also talk to other people, and you can kind of see in your own life when you're on a a productive path that sort of ennobles and enlightens you, or a destructive path.

135
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:26,762
And I think it's kind of useful to think that maybe the dichotomy between those two paths might be real, you know, because that also allows you to give credence to your intuitions about that sort of thing.

136
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,869
But I don't, anyways, I don't think it's unreasonable to posit that since you're alive, adopting

137
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:39,370
Highest possible regard for the fact that you're alive and that you're surrounded by other creatures that are alive

138
00:14:39,853 --> 00:14:43,010
I just can't see how that can possibly be construed as a losing strategy

139
00:14:44,073 --> 00:14:47,190
And so that's the first thing so that's something like faith right it's faith

140
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:54,290
It's not it's not only faith in your being but it's faith in being as such and the faith would be something like if you could

141
00:14:55,111 --> 00:15:01,710
Orient your being properly then maybe that would orient you with being as such and you never know

142
00:15:02,377 --> 00:15:03,589
Like I mean it might be true

143
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:07,810
There's no reason to assume that it wouldn't be true

144
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:15,187
I mean even if you just take a strict Biological perspective on this and think about us as the product of three and a half billion years of evolution.

145
00:15:15,187 --> 00:15:22,690
I mean we have Struggled over all those billions of years to be alive and to match ourselves with reality

146
00:15:23,393 --> 00:15:28,010
And so because one of the things I've often wondered is you know life is definitely difficult

147
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:35,667
There's no doubt about that and it's unfair and there's inequality and all of those things and people are subject to all sorts of terrible things, but I also wonder

148
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:40,230
If you weren't actively striving to make things worse

149
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:46,960
Just how much better could they be you know because people are very

150
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,650
They like houses that are divided amongst themselves

151
00:15:51,373 --> 00:15:53,950
They're pointing in six different directions at the same time

152
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:59,350
they're working at cross-purposes to themselves because of bitterness and resentment and

153
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:07,190
unprocessed memories and childhood hatreds and unexamined assumptions all sorts of things and

154
00:16:08,372 --> 00:16:14,630
you just got to wonder if you could push that aside and orient yourself properly and then the other thing that of course is

155
00:16:15,731 --> 00:16:22,030
stressed very heavily in the Old Testament and of course that goes through the entire biblical corpus is that

156
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:27,470
It's not only enough to establish a positive relationship with being which I think is the essential

157
00:16:28,615 --> 00:16:29,908
It's a good description of faith

158
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:33,950
You have to make that decision right because being is very ambivalent

159
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:38,430
And you can make the case that maybe it's something that should have never happened

160
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:45,750
But that doesn't seem to be productive to me and faith seems to be I'm going to act as if being is ultimately

161
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:50,930
Justifiable and then if I partake in it properly I will improve it rather than making it worse

162
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:56,710
So I think that's the statement of faith, and then what seems to go along with that is something like

163
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:06,450
truth in Conception and action you know even people like Jacob who are pretty damn morally ambivalent to begin with

164
00:17:06,911 --> 00:17:13,230
Get hammered a lot by what they go through and what seems to happen is that they're hammered into some sort of ethical shape

165
00:17:13,572 --> 00:17:16,310
Right so by the midpoint of their life's journey

166
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:27,450
there's people who are solidly planted who you can trust and who don't betray being or themselves or their fellow man, and so it's an interesting I mean

167
00:17:29,755 --> 00:17:34,110
It seems reasonable to me to first assume that you have to

168
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,689
Establish a relationship with something that's transcendent it might even be just the future version of you

169
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:48,010
but and then second that you have to align yourself with reality in a truthful manner and that that's your best bet and

170
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:58,910
The biblical stories are actually quite realistic about that too because they don't really say that if you do that you're going to be

171
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,830
Instantly transported to the promised land like even Moses as we'll find out in the Exodus stories

172
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:14,569
He never makes it to the promised land and so it's not like you're offered instantaneous final redemption if you move out forthrightly into the world

173
00:18:15,131 --> 00:18:26,210
establish a faithful relationship with being and attempt to conduct yourself with integrity but it's your best bet and it might be good enough and even if

174
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:39,510
it's not good enough it's really preferable to the alternative which seems to be something closely akin to hell both personal and social so Joseph's

175
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,623
father is Jacob, later Israel, he who wrestles with God.

176
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,917
And we've talked about that a little bit.

177
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:52,562
It's sort of implicit, and what I've been saying is that I think we all do that to some degree.

178
00:18:52,562 --> 00:18:55,955
We wrestle with reality itself, that's for sure.

179
00:18:55,955 --> 00:19:03,570
Not only the reality we understand, but the reality we don't understand, which is sort of a transcendent reality, and then maybe whatever reality is outside

180
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:12,110
of that, you know, because the classic Judeo-Christian conception of God is there's time and space and of course there's lots of things about what exists

181
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:19,750
in time and space that we're completely ignorant of and that's transcendent in that sense but then there's an idea that there's a realm outside of that which is

182
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:29,790
a well it's an interesting idea it's very sophisticated idea I think rather than a simple idea and it's it's difficult to know what to make of it but

183
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:40,790
it doesn't really matter because I think regardless of what your attitude is towards those sorts of things intellectually, you still end up in the same position as Jacob,

184
00:19:41,831 --> 00:19:44,277
for all intents and purposes, practically speaking.

185
00:19:44,277 --> 00:19:51,957
Because I don't think that there's anyone who at some point in their life, or perhaps even every day, doesn't at some level wrestle with God.

186
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:58,763
And you could just call it, well, the nature of reality, I suppose, if you want to be, say, reductionistic about it.

187
00:19:58,763 --> 00:19:59,770
But I don't think it makes any difference.

188
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:06,910
It's still something you're stuck with and it's not only the nature of reality itself that you have to struggle with

189
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:11,010
But it's also the nature of your moral relationship to it your behavioral relationship to it

190
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:16,490
so that's how you should perceive it and how you should conduct yourself and then whether or not the

191
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,270
Advantages of doing it properly are worth the difficulty and the disadvantages

192
00:20:22,813 --> 00:20:25,810
So that seems to me just a straight existential statement then you know

193
00:20:26,654 --> 00:20:30,570
Jacob gets damaged by his wrestling which is also very realistic

194
00:20:33,112 --> 00:20:35,710
Anyways, he also ends up as father of Joseph

195
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:42,710
Who's the favorite son son who's born in his old age to his favorite wife, and that's who we're going to talk about today

196
00:20:43,854 --> 00:20:56,148
so you remember so Jacob is the forefather of the twelve tribes of Israel and there's his His wives and the offspring that resulted.

197
00:20:56,148 --> 00:20:56,950
Those are all the sons

198
00:20:57,151 --> 00:21:02,710
There's a daughter named Dinah as well and Rachel is the woman he really loved and the first son

199
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:07,466
He had with Rachel was Joseph, and that was when he was older, and so that's in some sense.

200
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,770
Why Joseph is his favorite

201
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:21,470
This is the beginning of the story of Joseph now Israel Jacob loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors and

202
00:21:22,551 --> 00:21:25,098
There's a lot packed into those two sentences.

203
00:21:25,098 --> 00:21:29,670
You know the first is that now israel loved joseph more than all his other children

204
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:35,650
That's probably not so good one of the things we've seen in the stories that have preceded

205
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:41,310
This is that whenever there's marked preference on the part of parents for one child over the other

206
00:21:42,712 --> 00:21:57,209
with with with with Jacob and Esau it was Rachel was Jacob was Rachel's favorite and Isa was Isaac's favorite.

207
00:21:57,209 --> 00:21:58,030
That didn't work out so

208
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,388
That put a real twist in the entire structure of the family.

209
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:04,763
And so there's a warning there right off the bat.

210
00:22:04,763 --> 00:22:09,949
You might say, well you can't help having a preference for one child or for another, but I don't know if that's true.

211
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:14,558
And it's certainly something that you should be very cautious about because it doesn't seem to work out very well.

212
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:16,990
Because he was the son of his old age, fair enough,

213
00:22:17,354 --> 00:22:22,510
And he made him a coat of many colors That's a very interesting image that coat of many colors

214
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:28,910
That that idea and so I'm going to delve into that idea because it sets the stage like it says

215
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,899
What sort of person Joseph is he's favored.

216
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:33,002
He's younger.

217
00:22:33,002 --> 00:22:35,610
He's favored, but he also has this particular garment that

218
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:41,970
Characterizes him you know and one of the things I've really learned from analyzing women's dreams in particular

219
00:22:42,512 --> 00:22:47,450
is that women very frequently in my experience very frequently dream of clothing as a role and

220
00:22:48,295 --> 00:22:49,710
So if you're interpreting women's dreams

221
00:22:49,891 --> 00:22:53,710
Then if they put on the shoes of their grandmother for example

222
00:22:54,131 --> 00:23:00,650
Then you understand very rapidly that the dream is trying to make an association between their own behavior and something

223
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:11,009
That's characteristic of either the state of being a grandmother or the particular grandmother, and it makes sense right because clothing protects, but it also signifies a role and

224
00:23:12,151 --> 00:23:19,463
And it's interesting in the Old Testament stories often if someone is going to act deceitfully they change their outfit.

225
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,149
And that's kind of what you do when you act deceitfully, right?

226
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,869
You dress up like someone else.

227
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,804
You present yourself like someone else.

228
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,665
So anyways, back to the coat of many colours.

229
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:40,929
Well, for something to be many coloured, it sort of spans the entire gamut of possibility.

230
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:52,178
And so there's a hint there that if you want to be a full-fledged person, that you have to manifest a very large number of traits.

231
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,919
And so I want to go into that idea a bit.

232
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:01,619
The first thing I want to talk about is some of the things that we've learned about what happens to you when you go to a new environment.

233
00:24:02,282 --> 00:24:12,640
You know, there's this idea in, a very deep idea in clinical psychology, a fundamental idea, which is that if someone's anxious about something, what you do is you, and it's getting

234
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:18,937
in their way, you take what they're anxious about and you define it, because that already delimits it, right?

235
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,418
Because one of the problems with being anxious about something is you won't speak of it.

236
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,653
It's like Voldemort.

237
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,120
And then if you don't speak of it, it's way bigger than it should be.

238
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:29,575
As soon as you start talking about it, you cut it down to size.

239
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,619
And so, and it's for a bunch of reasons.

240
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:40,175
It's because you're not as afraid, you're not as afraid of as many things as you think, and you're braver than you know, and more capable.

241
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,299
So as soon as you're brave enough to start talking about what you're afraid of,

242
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:49,099
then you see that there's more to you than you thought, and that there's less to the problem than you thought.

243
00:24:49,942 --> 00:24:55,180
And then you can decompose it further into smaller problems, and then you can figure out how to approach those smaller problems.

244
00:24:55,681 --> 00:25:01,820
And so, and then it doesn't seem to me, to be that you get less frightened, it seems to be that you get more courageous.

245
00:25:01,961 --> 00:25:05,440
Which is way better than being less frightened, because there's lots of things to be frightened about.

246
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:07,980
So if you're courageous, that, that really does the trick.

247
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:17,579
Now the question is what happens if you like let's say that you're Very socially inept and you don't know how to introduce yourself or to make any

248
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:28,160
Establish the initial parts of a relationship with anyone and so then you start putting yourself in situations Where you're required to do that and so then the question is how is it?

249
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,593
Technically that you transform you say well you learn well.

250
00:25:32,593 --> 00:25:41,600
We want to be more specific about that What does it mean that you learn well if you're dealing with someone who's particularly socially inept and you're doing psychotherapy with them

251
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:47,020
You might teach them how to shake someone's hand properly and say their name and remember the other person's name

252
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:51,780
And so you just practice that with them so that they have the motoric routine down

253
00:25:52,143 --> 00:25:54,600
So that form of knowledge is built right into your body

254
00:25:54,761 --> 00:26:00,240
It's like look at the person put out your hand shake it don't not like a dead hell of it

255
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,580
But you know with a reasonable grip

256
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:08,560
Say your name don't mumble it look look at them so that they can hear you and then when they say their name try to

257
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:14,840
Remember it and that's it then so you can practice that with people and so then they develop something that's motoric, right?

258
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,140
It's embedded right in their body and so and then you can say to them well the other thing you can do is when you

259
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,980
Start a conversation is don't sit there thinking about what you're going to say next because

260
00:26:26,724 --> 00:26:30,180
then you won't be paying attention to the person and you'll make a fool out of yourself because

261
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:34,526
you'll manifest non-sequiturs, right?

262
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:41,509
Because you'll get out of it's like if you're dancing and all you're paying attention to is where your feet are then you're going to step on the other person all the time.

263
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:51,458
So you want to pay attention to the other person and then whatever automatized social knowledge you have will come to the forefront so it's a good thing to know if you're socially anxious, right?

264
00:26:51,458 --> 00:27:00,940
If you're socially One of the things you should do is pay way more attention to the person you're talking to Rather than less and you should pay as little attention as possible to yourself

265
00:27:01,543 --> 00:27:03,980
So if you feel yourself falling in because you're anxious

266
00:27:04,462 --> 00:27:13,360
Then what you do is you push your attention out and pay attention to the person because to the degree that you've been Socialized then all your automatic responses will kick in so but anyway

267
00:27:13,521 --> 00:27:21,620
so you go out into the social world and you learn to shake someone's hand and you learn how to listen to them and ask them questions because that's the next thing because

268
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:29,640
people love you can't just ask them random questions obviously but if they start talking to you and you don't understand something about what they're

269
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,920
saying or maybe something they said is interesting and you ask them a question

270
00:27:33,262 --> 00:27:39,960
they're pretty damn happy about that because it means you're actually paying attention to them and people actually love to be paid attention to because it

271
00:27:40,101 --> 00:27:50,560
hardly ever happens so they really really like it and so okay so so what's happening well first of all you're mastering them automated motor movements

272
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:59,680
right where to point your eyes where to put your hands how to move your lips like really embodied knowledge it's a special kind of memory you're practicing

273
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:11,000
that and so that's building new skills for you and then by listening to the person and watching yourself interact you're also generating new new abstract

274
00:28:11,181 --> 00:28:14,200
information that enables you to conceptualize the world in a different

275
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:19,760
So if you go out to 10, you go out and talk to 10 different people or 50 different people

276
00:28:20,302 --> 00:28:25,880
Then you get to listen to what those 50 people said you get to watch how they're how they express themselves

277
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:32,300
And you gather a corpus of knowledge that changes the way you perceive that broadens you as a social agent

278
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:37,320
Okay, so that's two forms of knowledge, but then there's a third one which is really interesting which is that

279
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:42,086
You know you have a lot of biological potential.

280
00:28:42,086 --> 00:28:50,033
And it's hard to know what potential is, but part of it is that you're capable of generating proteins that you haven't been generating.

281
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:51,500
So you should get right on that, by the way.

282
00:28:52,102 --> 00:28:57,000
So, but what the way that works in part is that if you put yourself in a radically new situation,

283
00:28:57,622 --> 00:29:06,816
then your brain, that there are genetic switches that turn on because of the demands of the new situation that code for new proteins.

284
00:29:06,816 --> 00:29:13,500
So it's as if you have latent software that would be one way of thinking about that will only be turned

285
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:22,080
on if you go into the situation where that's necessary and so then you might think well if that's the case how much of you could be turned on if you went a

286
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:32,040
whole bunch of different places and that's a really really that's a profound question because one of the deep answers to how you should get your life together

287
00:29:32,683 --> 00:29:38,338
is you should go a very large number of places and turn yourself on and

288
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:52,859
I want to walk through that a little bit because there's a very rich symbolic world that expresses that so now the idea about having a coat of many colors would be that the person who is

289
00:29:54,602 --> 00:29:59,320
The appropriate leader because remember or the proper person which would be the same thing

290
00:29:59,942 --> 00:30:05,900
One of the things that these old stories are trying to express and to figure out is how is it that you should act?

291
00:30:06,242 --> 00:30:15,480
Which is the same as what constitutes the ideal those are the same Question and the hint here with Joseph is well you should wear a coat of many colors

292
00:30:15,621 --> 00:30:22,499
Which means that you should be able to go have a drink in the pub with the guys who are You know dry walling your your house

293
00:30:22,923 --> 00:30:32,378
And you should be able to have a sophisticated conversation with someone who's more educated in an abstract way and that maybe you should be equally comfortable in both situations, right?

294
00:30:32,378 --> 00:30:35,631
Because you might think, well, there's more.

295
00:30:35,631 --> 00:30:42,858
One of the indications that there's more to you is that you can be put more places and function properly.

296
00:30:42,858 --> 00:30:48,280
And that would be a good thing to aim at because, here's the other issue, is that you know perfectly

297
00:30:48,521 --> 00:30:59,539
well that the fundamental tragedies of life and your exposure to malevolence in course of that life, so those being the worst things, there's not a lot you can do to alter

298
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:03,373
that fundamentally, because they're conditions of existence.

299
00:31:03,373 --> 00:31:07,789
You're going to be subject to your vulnerability and you're going to be subject to malevolence.

300
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:10,097
That's that.

301
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:12,889
And you can't hide from it because it actually makes it worse.

302
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:14,275
So you're stuck with it.

303
00:31:14,275 --> 00:31:16,524
So then the question is, well, what are your options?

304
00:31:16,524 --> 00:31:26,255
And one option is to curse the structure of being for being malevolent and tragic and fair enough and the other is to make yourself so damn differentiated and

305
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,920
Dynamic and able that you're more than a match for that

306
00:31:32,961 --> 00:31:37,753
Now that's not an easy thing, but doesn't matter because like what what's the alternative?

307
00:31:37,753 --> 00:31:40,300
There's no good alternative, and that's also worth knowing

308
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:42,431
so

309
00:31:45,264 --> 00:31:50,335
You see these ideas expressed in the strangest places and so We've talked a little bit.

310
00:31:50,335 --> 00:31:54,350
I think in this in this series about Pinocchio, but if we haven't it doesn't matter

311
00:31:56,372 --> 00:32:10,160
You see there's Jiminy Cricket at the opening of the Pinocchio movie pointing to a star which is roughly the nativity star for all intents and purposes and it's a it's a symbolic indicator of

312
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:13,835
Something diamond like and pure right?

313
00:32:15,106 --> 00:32:20,480
glimmering in the darkness that's transcendent and above the horizon upon which to fix your eyes

314
00:32:20,803 --> 00:32:21,854
and so that's

315
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,116
and the thing is you need that technically

316
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,935
and the reason you need that is because

317
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:34,379
we know enough about psychology now to know that almost all of the positive emotion that you're going to experience in your life, and positive emotion is

318
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:42,480
analgesic by the way, right, it actually quells pain, so it's not just positive, it also gets rid of negative, which is a big plus almost all the positive emotion

319
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,280
that you're going to feel, you're going to feel in relationship to a goal.

320
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,359
Because you feel positive emotion as you approach a goal.

321
00:32:51,241 --> 00:32:54,294
And so if you want to feel positive emotion, then you need a goal.

322
00:32:54,294 --> 00:33:04,660
And then you might think, well if you want to maximize that positive emotion, which is enthusiasm and also what pulls you out into the world, as well as feeling good, then you need the best possible goal.

323
00:33:05,282 --> 00:33:09,946
Well, that, because that's going to engage the largest

324
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:16,120
Segments of your being like if your goal is too narrow then a bunch of you isn't going to be on board for it

325
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,140
You know if the goal is well developed and multifaceted

326
00:33:19,721 --> 00:33:26,080
Then all of you can partake in that even your negative elements even your anger and and your fear can get on board with that

327
00:33:26,261 --> 00:33:28,219
Let's say so you need a goal man.

328
00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:33,680
That's Worthy you got to think you good you need a goal that justifies the tragedy and malevolence of life

329
00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:37,111
That seems to be the bottom line now.

330
00:33:37,111 --> 00:33:37,853
Maybe you think well.

331
00:33:37,853 --> 00:33:39,218
There's no goal that can do that.

332
00:33:39,218 --> 00:33:45,510
It's like well Well, there are still better and worse goals.

333
00:33:46,272 --> 00:33:49,728
So, and I'm not convinced that there are no goals that can do that.

334
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:51,602
I think that's an open question.

335
00:33:52,570 --> 00:34:00,107
You'd never know that until you pursued the proper goal long enough to find out who you would be as a consequence of pursuing it.

336
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,470
That's also your destiny or your existential voyage, right?

337
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,826
It's also not something that anyone else can do for you.

338
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:10,162
Someone can say, get your act together, for Christ's sake, and get at it.

339
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:18,047
make the world unfold best for you, but there's no way you can know that without doing it, so...

340
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:29,462
And unless you think you've done a particularly stellar job of that, then you have no reason to doubt its potential validity.

341
00:34:29,462 --> 00:34:31,950
So plus, like, crickets are telling you this, and so...

342
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,340
You know, they're a very reliable source.

343
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:46,470
Okay, so you see the star, the star recurs as a motif in Pinocchio, and one of the more interesting elements of it here is that when Geppetto wants to transform his puppet,

344
00:34:47,072 --> 00:34:51,590
the marionette who's being played by forces that operate behind the scenes,

345
00:34:51,831 --> 00:35:01,030
which is a really good definition of the persona from a Jungian perspective, right, and also something indicative of something like an ideological or conceptual possession.

346
00:35:02,431 --> 00:35:10,830
Geppetto, who's a good guy, he's a positive father figure, even though he's a patriarchal figure, right, and a very competent one,

347
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:19,604
he still even lifts his eyes up to something that transcends his mode of being, positive as it is, and wishes that his creation would

348
00:35:20,471 --> 00:35:27,099
undertake the kind of transformation that would make it autonomous and fully functional as a moral agent.

349
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:28,445
No strings, right?

350
00:35:28,445 --> 00:35:29,750
So that's very interesting, I think.

351
00:35:31,014 --> 00:35:36,129
Solzhenitsyn said the salvation of mankind lies only in making everything the concern of all

352
00:35:37,832 --> 00:35:40,665
That's a pretty decent star like goal.

353
00:35:40,665 --> 00:35:47,390
I would say and So what happens in the Pinocchio story is that because and I think this is a symbolic

354
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:53,630
representative of what I just described to you that happens at a genetic level if you put yourself in new situations, so

355
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:58,108
So Geppetto is roughly culture in the Pinocchio story, right?

356
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:02,827
He's a craftsman, and he makes Pinocchio.

357
00:36:03,831 --> 00:36:09,208
So he's, who's his son, he's the socializing agent.

358
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:17,926
And he aims for something above mere socialization, which is I think part of the mysterious element of human beings.

359
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:22,047
You know, in our scientific models we basically have socialization and biology.

360
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:32,207
But there's always a third element in mythological stories, which is whatever you might construe as the spontaneous action of consciousness that's associated with free will.

361
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:37,264
And you know, that's just basically being conceptualized in religious terms as something akin to the soul.

362
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:46,106
And we don't have a category for that scientifically, because what we try to do scientifically is to reduce everything either to socialization or to biology.

363
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:54,443
But it isn't clear to me that it's perfectly reasonable from the perspective of practicality at a scientific level.

364
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,067
You don't want to multiply explanatory principles beyond necessity.

365
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,750
But there's many things that that doesn't come to terms with, such as the fact that

366
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:06,449
we all treat each other as autonomous beings with free will, and that that seems to work,

367
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,543
and that if we stop doing that, then things go to hell very, very rapidly.

368
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:19,502
And the mere fact that we have been able to conceptualize what that conscious free will might be Metaphysically or physically doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

369
00:37:19,502 --> 00:37:21,090
It just means that we don't understand it

370
00:37:21,753 --> 00:37:24,950
I mean what it was only in the last 15 years that we discovered that

371
00:37:26,153 --> 00:37:29,230
95% of the universe was made out of some kind of matter that we can't even

372
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:34,329
Whose properties we can't even imagine except that it seems to have math

373
00:37:37,011 --> 00:37:41,190
Anyways, what happens is when Geppetto reach lifts his eyes up to the star

374
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:48,710
He so it's society aligning itself with the proper goal with regards to individual development, right?

375
00:37:48,871 --> 00:37:53,830
So so there instead of society being at odds with the individual they line up

376
00:37:54,435 --> 00:37:56,330
And then what happens is nature comes on board

377
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:02,970
And that's the blue fairy in the in the Pinocchio story and that seems to me to be a symbolic representation of what happens biologically

378
00:38:05,212 --> 00:38:09,750
When you set the goal properly get your culture behind you and move into the world is that?

379
00:38:10,933 --> 00:38:17,030
There's a biological transformation that occurs as a consequence of that which means that a bunch of you that hasn't been turned on

380
00:38:17,871 --> 00:38:25,442
Turns on and I guess one question would be is what would you be like if you turned on everything inside of you that could be turned on

381
00:38:26,352 --> 00:38:27,659
Well, that's a good goal.

382
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:35,030
That's a good thing to find out so now I'm going to introduce a couple of other ideas, so

383
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:40,810
So, there's this idea in Jungian psychology called the circumambulation, and Jung had

384
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:47,030
this idea that you had a potential future self, which would be impotential, everything

385
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:54,842
that you could be, and that it manifests itself moment to moment in your present life by making you interested in things.

386
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:59,170
And the things that you're interested in are the things that would guide you along the

387
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:01,427
path that would lead you to maximal development.

388
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:12,290
Now, it sounds like a metaphysical idea, or a mystical idea even, but it's not, it's not, it's a really profoundly biological idea.

389
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:21,550
The idea is something like, well, you're set up so that you're automatically interested in those things that would fully expand you as a well-adapted creature.

390
00:39:21,831 --> 00:39:24,629
Well, like, there's nothing radical about that idea.

391
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:30,690
How else what else could possibly be the case unless there's something fundamentally flawed about you

392
00:39:31,231 --> 00:39:37,250
That is what the situation would be it's kind of interesting to think about how that would be manifest moment to moment

393
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:43,590
But the idea is something like well your interest is captured by those things that lead you down the path of development

394
00:39:44,553 --> 00:39:46,810
Well that better be the case okay, so that's fine

395
00:39:47,492 --> 00:39:52,209
And so there's some utility in pursuing those things that you're interested in that's the call to adventure.

396
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:52,490
Let's say

397
00:39:53,854 --> 00:39:59,190
So and the call to adventure takes you all sorts of places now the problem with the call to adventure is like what the hell do

398
00:40:00,613 --> 00:40:03,450
you might be interested in things that are kind of warped and bent and

399
00:40:04,671 --> 00:40:08,950
often it's the case that when new parts of people manifest themselves and

400
00:40:09,671 --> 00:40:13,390
grip their interests say they do it very badly and shoddily and

401
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:20,150
So you stumble around like an idiot when you try to do something new that's why the fool is the precursor to the savior from the

402
00:40:20,672 --> 00:40:27,588
from the symbolic perspectives because you have to be a fool before you can be a master and if you're not willing to be a fool, then you can't be a master, so

403
00:40:29,215 --> 00:40:33,190
So you're going to it's an error error-ridden process

404
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:38,490
And that's also laid out in the old testament stories because the first thing that happens to all these patriarchal figures when

405
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:48,470
God kicks them out of their father's house when they're like 84 is that they they run into all sorts of trouble and some of its social and some of its natural some of

406
00:40:48,651 --> 00:40:50,510
it's a consequence of their own moral inadequacy

407
00:40:51,352 --> 00:40:59,030
So they're fools and but but the thing that's so interesting is that despite the fact that they're fools they're still supposed to go on the adventure and

408
00:40:59,931 --> 00:41:06,890
that they're capable of learning enough as a consequence of moving forward on the adventure so that they straighten themselves out across time and

409
00:41:07,912 --> 00:41:17,870
So it's something like this this circumambulation that Jung talked about was this continual will return to this this continual circling in some sense of who you could be

410
00:41:18,313 --> 00:41:20,930
You might notice for example that there are themes in your life

411
00:41:21,131 --> 00:41:27,330
you know when you go back across your experiences you see you kind of have your typical experience that sort of repeats itself and

412
00:41:28,213 --> 00:41:30,650
There might be variation on it like a musical theme

413
00:41:30,831 --> 00:41:36,810
But it's it's like you're circling yourself and getting closer to yourself as you move across time

414
00:41:37,332 --> 00:41:41,430
That's the circumambulation now you remember that for a sec because we'll go back to it okay

415
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:45,210
So imagine that something glimmers before you it's an an interest

416
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:49,410
That's dawning and you decide well first of all you're paralyzed you think well

417
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:55,170
How do I know if I should pursue that it's probably a stupid idea and the proper response to that is you're right

418
00:41:55,311 --> 00:42:00,269
It probably is a stupid idea because almost all ideas are stupid and so the

419
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:06,770
Probability that as you move forward on your adventure that you're gonna get it right the first time is zero

420
00:42:07,573 --> 00:42:10,490
It's just not gonna happen and so then you might think well

421
00:42:10,691 --> 00:42:16,868
Maybe I'll just wait around until I get the right idea and which people do right, so they're like 40 year old 13 year olds

422
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:24,270
Which is not a good idea, so they wait around until it's waiting for Godot until they finally got it right

423
00:42:24,451 --> 00:42:32,008
But the problem is you're too stupid to know when you've got it right so waiting around isn't going to help because even if it the perfect opportunity

424
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:38,830
manifested itself to you in your incomplete form the probability that you would recognize it as the perfect opportunity is

425
00:42:39,031 --> 00:42:44,470
Zero you might even think it's the worst possible idea that you've ever heard of anywhere highly likely

426
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:51,070
Highly likely so so you have there's Nietzsche Nietzsche called that a will to stupidity

427
00:42:51,692 --> 00:42:55,410
Which I really liked so because he thought of stupidity as being it

428
00:42:56,414 --> 00:43:05,310
You know it's it's you have to take it into account fundamentally and work with it and so and so you can take these tentative steps on your

429
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:10,410
pathway to destiny and you can assume that you're gonna do it badly and that's

430
00:43:10,711 --> 00:43:18,010
really useful because you don't have to beat yourself up it's pretty easy to do it badly but the thing is it's way better to do it badly than not to do it

431
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:27,750
at all and that's the continual message that echoes through these historical stories in Genesis it's like these are flawed people they they should have got

432
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:36,110
the hell out of their house way before they did and they go out and they stumble around in tyranny and famine and self-betrayal and and

433
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:46,750
Violence and but it's a hell of a lot better than just rotting away at home, and that's the that's great So that's good, and so why is that well okay?

434
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:54,606
So you you start your path, and you think that you're heading you know towards your star and so you go in that direction and then because

435
00:43:56,352 --> 00:44:05,170
You're here the world looks a particular way, but then when you move here The world looks different and you're different as a consequence of having made that voyage

436
00:44:05,371 --> 00:44:11,890
And so what that means is that now that thing that glimmers in front of you is going to have shifted its location

437
00:44:12,471 --> 00:44:18,550
Because you weren't very good at specifying it to begin with and now that you're a little sharper and more focused than you were

438
00:44:19,332 --> 00:44:25,070
It's it's going to reveal itself with more accuracy to you, and so then you have to take

439
00:44:27,075 --> 00:44:38,130
You know, it's almost like a hundred and eighty degree reversal, but it isn't because you know you've I Mean you've gone this far, and that's a long ways to get that far

440
00:44:39,231 --> 00:44:44,850
but that's a lot farther than you would be if you just stayed where you were waiting and

441
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:49,959
So it doesn't matter that you overshoot continually

442
00:44:50,933 --> 00:44:55,879
Because as you overshoot Even if you don't learn what you should have done.

443
00:44:55,879 --> 00:44:59,450
You're going to continually learn what you shouldn't keep doing and

444
00:45:00,733 --> 00:45:03,408
If you learn enough about what you shouldn't keep doing then

445
00:45:04,632 --> 00:45:10,070
That's tantamount at some point to learning at the same time what you should be doing so it's okay

446
00:45:11,514 --> 00:45:12,242
So it's like this

447
00:45:14,256 --> 00:45:15,430
Now what's cool about it though?

448
00:45:15,511 --> 00:45:23,790
I think is that as you progress the Degree of overshooting starts to decline right and that we know that there's nothing

449
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:30,470
Hypothetical about that as you learn a new skill like even to play play a song on the piano for example you overshoot madly

450
00:45:30,671 --> 00:45:33,590
You're making all sorts of mistakes to begin with and then the mistakes

451
00:45:38,157 --> 00:45:44,319
They disappear. There's a great Ted talk, I think it was about this guy set up a really advanced

452
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:50,760
Computational recording system in his home and recorded every single utterance his young child made

453
00:45:51,641 --> 00:45:58,200
while learning to speak and then he put together the child's attempts to say certain phonemes and

454
00:45:59,224 --> 00:46:06,020
Put them in the list and you can hear the child deviating madly to begin with and then after hundreds and hundreds of repetitions just

455
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:11,420
Zeroing right in on the exact phoneme, so you know you might not know this

456
00:46:11,581 --> 00:46:16,580
But when kids babble because they start babbling when they're quite young they babble every human phoneme

457
00:46:17,522 --> 00:46:24,480
including all sorts of phonemes that adults can't say and then they they die into their language so that after

458
00:46:25,463 --> 00:46:27,900
They learn say English then there's all sorts of phonemes

459
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:30,860
They can no longer hear or pronounce, but to begin with it's all there

460
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,376
Which is really quite interesting, but so they see as they learn a particular language.

461
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:42,420
They zero in on the proper way to Pronounce that and their errors minimize and every time you learn something

462
00:46:42,641 --> 00:46:50,962
That's how it is and that's really useful to know too because it means that it's okay to wander around stupidly before you fix your destination.

463
00:46:50,962 --> 00:46:53,549
Now you see that echoed in Exodus, right?

464
00:46:53,549 --> 00:46:57,800
Because what happens is that the Egyptians or the Hebrews escape a tyranny

465
00:46:58,284 --> 00:47:08,429
Which is kind of whatever you do personally and psychologically when you escape from your previous set of stupidly held and Ignorant and stubborn axioms.

466
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:09,814
It's like away from that tyranny.

467
00:47:09,814 --> 00:47:10,476
It's like great.

468
00:47:10,476 --> 00:47:11,520
I freed myself from that

469
00:47:12,026 --> 00:47:12,613
Well, then what?

470
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:15,235
Well, you think well now I'm on the way.

471
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:15,880
It's no you're not now

472
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:22,840
You're in the desert where you wander around stupidly, you know and worship the wrong things until you finally

473
00:47:23,401 --> 00:47:29,320
Organize yourself morally again and head in the proper direction, so that's worth knowing too because you think

474
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:36,120
Well, I got rid of a lot of things, baggage, excess baggage that I didn't need in my life, and now everything's okay

475
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:42,220
It's not you've got rid of a whole set of scaffolds that were keeping you in place even though they were pathological

476
00:47:43,102 --> 00:47:51,660
Now you have nothing and nothing actually turns out to be better than something pathological, but you're still stuck with the problem of nothing and

477
00:47:52,641 --> 00:47:55,912
That's well, that's exactly why exodus is structured the way that it is.

478
00:47:55,912 --> 00:47:57,878
It's that you escape from a tyranny.

479
00:47:57,878 --> 00:47:58,440
It's hooray

480
00:47:58,701 --> 00:47:59,825
We're no longer slaves.

481
00:47:59,825 --> 00:48:04,380
Yeah, well now you're nihilistic and lost it's not necessarily an improvement

482
00:48:05,202 --> 00:48:11,960
But it is, but it is the pre, see, it's also useful to know that because you can also be deluded into the idea that

483
00:48:12,661 --> 00:48:17,820
Imagine that you're trying to become enlightened which might mean to turn all those parts of you on that could be turned on

484
00:48:18,402 --> 00:48:20,850
You think well, that's just a linear pathway uphill.

485
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:23,078
You know it's just from one success to another.

486
00:48:24,362 --> 00:48:28,760
It's like here you are and you're not doing too badly and the first step is a complete bloody catastrophe

487
00:48:28,841 --> 00:48:31,880
It's worse and then maybe you can pull yourself together

488
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:37,380
And you hit a new plateau and then that crumbles and shakes and bang it's worse again

489
00:48:37,621 --> 00:48:42,700
And so because part of the reason that people don't become enlightened is because it's punctuated by

490
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:48,820
Intermittent deserts essentially by intermittent catastrophes, and if you don't know that well

491
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:54,940
Then you're basically screwed because you go ahead on your movement forward and you collapse and you think well that didn't work

492
00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:58,556
I collapsed it's like no that's That's par for the course.

493
00:48:59,566 --> 00:49:00,940
It's not indication that you failed.

494
00:49:01,122 --> 00:49:02,940
It's just indication that it's really hard.

495
00:49:03,748 --> 00:49:04,940
And that when you learn something,

496
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,415
you also unlearn something.

497
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:10,435
And the thing you unlearned is probably useful, and unlearning it actually is painful.

498
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,940
You know, let's say if you have to get out of a bad relationship.

499
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:17,071
It's like not every- not any- There isn't any relationship that's 100% bad.

500
00:49:19,283 --> 00:49:24,051
And so when you jump out of it, well, maybe you're in better shape, but you're still lonesome and disoriented,

501
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,140
Was and you don't know what your present is and you don't know what your future is it's that's not

502
00:49:30,161 --> 00:49:31,927
That's why people stay with the devil.

503
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,396
They know instead of looking for the devil.

504
00:49:34,396 --> 00:49:45,424
They don't know so so anyways the fact that you're full of faults doesn't mean you have to stop and Thank God for that.

505
00:49:45,424 --> 00:49:51,060
That's a really useful thing and the fact that you're full of faults doesn't mean that you can't learn and

506
00:49:51,944 --> 00:49:55,220
And so you can posit an ideal and you're going to be wrong about it

507
00:49:55,641 --> 00:50:01,520
But it doesn't matter because what you're right about is positing the ideal moving towards it if the actual ideal isn't

508
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:08,046
Conceptualized perfectly well first surprise surprise because like what are you going to do

509
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:12,150
That's perfect, so It doesn't matter that it's imperfect imperfect

510
00:50:12,231 --> 00:50:14,330
It just matters that you do it and that you move forward

511
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:20,650
So that's really that's really positive news as far as I'm concerned because you can actually do that right you can do it badly

512
00:50:21,513 --> 00:50:30,950
anyone can do that so that's that's useful okay so like if you were an efficient person you would have just done that but you're not but who cares

513
00:50:31,151 --> 00:50:42,030
you know you still end up in the in the same place and maybe the trip is even more interesting who knows probably too interesting young I began to understand

514
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:49,520
that the goal of psychic development by which he means psychological development spiritual development, is the self.

515
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:52,165
There's no linear evolution.

516
00:50:52,165 --> 00:50:55,073
There's only a circumambulation of the self, a getting closer.

517
00:50:55,073 --> 00:50:57,500
It's like, it's like you're spiraling into something.

518
00:50:59,081 --> 00:50:59,804
Something like that.

519
00:50:59,804 --> 00:51:08,828
And the thing that you're spiraling into recedes as you move towards it, and gets more and more sophisticated and well-developed as you move towards it.

520
00:51:08,828 --> 00:51:10,675
Because you're not going to run out of goals, right?

521
00:51:10,675 --> 00:51:14,880
No matter how much you have your act together, there's probably, undoubtedly,

522
00:51:16,122 --> 00:51:26,620
30 dimensions along which you could get your act together a lot more, and some of those aren't even conceivable to you when you're in your initial uncarved state, let's say.

523
00:51:27,804 --> 00:51:30,093
Uniform development exists at most at the beginning.

524
00:51:30,093 --> 00:51:31,880
Later, everything points towards the center.

525
00:51:32,041 --> 00:51:35,880
This insight gave me stability and gradually my inner peace returned.

526
00:51:41,109 --> 00:51:42,852
So this is fun.

527
00:51:42,852 --> 00:51:44,895
On the left there, that's the Chartres Cathedral.

528
00:51:44,895 --> 00:51:47,640
That's the one that has the maze in it that I told you about.

529
00:51:48,261 --> 00:51:59,120
They actually light that up with lasers now, and so that's it lit up with lasers, and so So they're turning it into a cathedral of light, which I think is really fascinating

530
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:06,792
And it's a it's a continuation of the same idea right because the stained glass windows were obviously I wouldn't call them primitive attempts to do that.

531
00:52:06,792 --> 00:52:13,720
I mean stained glass windows are pretty impressive You know, but it's an elaboration of the same thing so now you can go to that Cathedral

532
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,980
They light up the whole town like that which is really something and so there and there is how the cathedral is built

533
00:52:19,142 --> 00:52:26,040
It's a cross and you remember the cross is an X that marks the center of the world and the cross is the place where each

534
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:37,896
Individual is and I think that's the fundamental Message of Christianity is the cross marks the place where every single individual is and it's a tragic place that consists of suffering and

535
00:52:38,501 --> 00:52:43,260
Exposure to malevolence and that the only way to come to terms with it is to accept it

536
00:52:44,343 --> 00:52:48,500
And that seems to me, I don't see anything metaphysical about that statement whatsoever.

537
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:54,920
It's like, well X marks the spot, fair enough, you're in a spot, you're right in the center of your world,

538
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:58,679
it's right in the center of THE world as far as you're concerned, and the same with the rest of us.

539
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:03,459
It's characterized by suffering and exposure to malevolence, there's no doubt about that.

540
00:53:04,001 --> 00:53:05,566
What are you gonna do about that?

541
00:53:05,566 --> 00:53:06,349
Bitter?

542
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,232
Resentful?

543
00:53:07,232 --> 00:53:08,115
Hateful?

544
00:53:08,115 --> 00:53:09,339
All that doesn't make it worse.

545
00:53:10,366 --> 00:53:11,538
So you have to accept it.

546
00:53:12,262 --> 00:53:18,379
Now that's not an easy thing, because that's actually, I would say, a heroic task to voluntarily accept the conditions of your own existence.

547
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:20,949
And that happens at the cross.

548
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:21,893
So that's fine.

549
00:53:21,893 --> 00:53:23,419
And that's associated with light.

550
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,148
Well that's good, that that's associated with light.

551
00:53:26,148 --> 00:53:29,459
You wouldn't want that to be associated with darkness, that would be a bad thing.

552
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:42,028
So, and so there's the, there's the uh, the labyrinth.

553
00:53:42,028 --> 00:53:42,669
That was built in 1200 A.D.

554
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:52,090
And so the idea is you walk in here, it's the same idea as that star sequence of slides that I just showed you.

555
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:59,729
So here's the idea, is that north, south, west, and east, so that's the whole world laid out in two dimensions.

556
00:54:00,534 --> 00:54:02,630
And so the question is, how do you get to the center?

557
00:54:02,731 --> 00:54:05,589
Now we already know what the center is, the center is the center of the cross.

558
00:54:06,131 --> 00:54:13,050
That's the place of maximal suffering, you could say maximal malevolence as well, but it's also the place where that's transcendent.

559
00:54:13,171 --> 00:54:15,018
So how do you get there?

560
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:21,110
Well, the answer is well, you don't just stand on the outside Looking in that's not gonna help

561
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:34,490
so and you can't just run right to the center even if you're in California and so you have to walk in here and then you see you go like this and

562
00:54:36,332 --> 00:54:45,350
You go to every single place every single place on that on that little cosmos and then once you've gone to every single place and

563
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:53,830
expanded yourself as a consequence of going north and west and east and south then there's enough of you so that you're at so that you can tolerate being

564
00:54:54,253 --> 00:55:02,050
first of all that you can figure out where the center is but also that you can tolerate being at the center and so that's what that represents that's pretty

565
00:55:02,552 --> 00:55:12,290
and look I mean let's make no mistake about it hey people were pretty damn I'm serious about those ideas like that's a that's quite the piece of work for people in the 12th century

566
00:55:12,611 --> 00:55:17,588
You know those some of those damn cathedrals took 300 years to build we don't build anything that takes 300 years

567
00:55:18,992 --> 00:55:22,570
You know people were putting a lot of effort into whatever these things meant

568
00:55:23,952 --> 00:55:27,250
You know and if you think they meant bearded man in the sky, then you know

569
00:55:28,731 --> 00:55:38,949
It's hard to it's hard to account for the kind of motivation that would produce these buildings with that kind of paucity of conceptualization.

570
00:55:39,311 --> 00:55:47,949
You know, the towns, and it was certainly the case in Chartres, that they groaned under the tax burden that was required to produce these.

571
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:52,130
Now, you might think, well, that's partly tyrannical, and no doubt that's the case.

572
00:55:52,371 --> 00:55:56,130
But that's not the whole story.

573
00:55:56,452 --> 00:56:00,741
The whole story is that the people who produced those buildings, they thought about every bit of it.

574
00:56:02,511 --> 00:56:08,307
It's nothing's accidental, and they're trying to portray something just like that window is trying to portray something.

575
00:56:08,307 --> 00:56:15,909
That's the same thing as this It's the center from which all things manifest themselves you see it that's Christ there and

576
00:56:17,311 --> 00:56:26,010
Being portrayed as as that center or the center within him something like that very much like the chakras and in in yogic practice

577
00:56:26,852 --> 00:56:28,376
Same basic idea.

578
00:56:28,376 --> 00:56:33,510
It's the opening up of the internal structure, and it's proper realization.

579
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:41,719
So, there are people walking the labyrinth.

580
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:46,420
So that's the code of many colors, right?

581
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:56,159
That's this differentiated mode of being that enables you to be competent and at home in the widest possible number of places.

582
00:56:57,084 --> 00:56:59,719
that's a real differentiation of your personality.

583
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:11,671
It's a breaking through the boundaries of your personality, including the ones that you impose on yourself, to become someone who's useful wherever they're put.

584
00:57:11,671 --> 00:57:14,160
And that's really relevant to this story of Joseph, too.

585
00:57:15,101 --> 00:57:19,780
Because one of the things that happens to Joseph is that, well, a lot of bad things happen to him.

586
00:57:21,242 --> 00:57:23,780
Because he's the favorite of his father, his brothers hate him.

587
00:57:24,606 --> 00:57:26,580
And so the first they're going to throw him in a pit

588
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:31,140
I think they do throw him in a pit then they sell them to be a slave then he ends up in

589
00:57:31,924 --> 00:57:32,813
We'll go through the story

590
00:57:33,962 --> 00:57:37,640
He ends up some places where you probably wouldn't want to go prison being one of them

591
00:57:38,784 --> 00:57:42,900
but It doesn't matter because even when they put him in prison

592
00:57:43,964 --> 00:57:45,156
He's actually not in prison

593
00:57:46,202 --> 00:57:50,460
He just figures out how to make the prison work way better, and then he's in control of the prison

594
00:57:51,244 --> 00:57:53,816
And it's really it's an interesting.

595
00:57:53,816 --> 00:57:58,640
I had this friend you know and he was very smart, but very cynical and

596
00:57:59,801 --> 00:58:06,400
He wasn't employed very well, and he got a little older than he should have given his level of intelligence and

597
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,520
Employability and so he had to take jobs that weren't very intellectually challenging

598
00:58:11,542 --> 00:58:15,520
You know and one of the things I tried to convince him of was that even if he worked

599
00:58:16,584 --> 00:58:20,520
He wanted to work behind the parts department in an automotive store because he liked cars

600
00:58:21,023 --> 00:58:25,878
but it was beneath him you know because it was sort of a as far as he was concerned it was a

601
00:58:27,202 --> 00:58:30,640
He was too smart for a job like that which actually turned out not to be true

602
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,120
He wasn't smart enough for a job like that, or he wasn't wise enough

603
00:58:33,542 --> 00:58:38,000
But you know I one of the things I tried to tell him was that you're looking at the situation wrong

604
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:44,240
Because even in a simple job so-called simple job like let's say dishwashing in a restaurant

605
00:58:44,301 --> 00:58:46,300
Which I did an awful lot of it's not that simple

606
00:58:47,261 --> 00:58:51,213
You're dealing with a lot of other people very fast staff changeover.

607
00:58:51,213 --> 00:58:53,500
You're feeding people you're helping them have a celebration

608
00:58:54,424 --> 00:59:01,300
You're helping them Take a break like you can do it really well, and then the kitchen can operate properly

609
00:59:01,563 --> 00:59:03,340
And then people can come out to the restaurant

610
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:07,620
It's not a bloody catastrophe and like you're even when you're doing something

611
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:16,471
That's a menial job so to speak like dishwashing there are ways of doing it really badly resentfully and horribly, and doing it really well.

612
00:59:16,471 --> 00:59:19,258
And as soon as you do it really well, it's not a menial job anymore.

613
00:59:19,258 --> 00:59:21,564
It immediately transforms.

614
00:59:21,564 --> 00:59:24,000
Now, I mean, you can be around people who won't let that happen.

615
00:59:25,382 --> 00:59:27,770
And you should go get another job if that's the case.

616
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:30,239
But if you do it properly, then it's not menial at all.

617
00:59:31,723 --> 00:59:35,729
And that's also a good way out of resentment.

618
00:59:35,729 --> 00:59:37,840
You think, well, I've just got this, you know, two-bit job.

619
00:59:37,961 --> 00:59:41,617
It's like, yeah, what if you did it as well as you possibly could?

620
00:59:41,617 --> 00:59:42,280
You know, what would happen?

621
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,290
Well, the first thing that would happen is you'd get a lot smarter.

622
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,420
That's for sure and that that's hardly a negative thing

623
00:59:50,602 --> 00:59:52,960
Okay, so that's the code of many colors

624
00:59:53,741 --> 01:00:00,400
So it's an intimation of what Joseph is like and what we're seeing with all of these patriarchal figures is the continual

625
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:06,312
realization of the ideal person right you could think about it as successive

626
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:14,160
estimations of the ideal person and the story is exploring all sorts of different possibilities including ones that are very violent and

627
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:25,199
catastrophic and malevolent, it's trying to cover the entire territory and to focus in on what's the proper way through the maze, the maze of life, the labyrinth.

628
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:29,400
And the hint here is that, well, you should be multi-dimensional.

629
01:00:30,661 --> 01:00:32,306
These are the generations of Jacob.

630
01:00:32,306 --> 01:00:39,529
Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock with his brethren and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives.

631
01:00:39,529 --> 01:00:43,280
And Joseph brought unto his father their evil report."

632
01:00:44,104 --> 01:00:44,306
Well,

633
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:51,625
we already know that Joseph is Jacob's favorite, and so that doesn't make him very popular among his brothers.

634
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:58,517
He's younger, and now we also find out that he's been set up more or less as you might say a snitch,

635
01:00:59,061 --> 01:01:04,280
because that's what this phrase means, is that he goes out and watches his older brothers, and if they do something they shouldn't do,

636
01:01:04,701 --> 01:01:08,575
Then he comes trotting back to Jacob and reports.

637
01:01:08,575 --> 01:01:09,840
Well, that's not going to make you popular

638
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:17,110
So and you would say well is that Joseph's problem or Jacob's problem?

639
01:01:18,012 --> 01:01:22,630
And I would say and this is something I learned from reading Jung too is that that's a conspiratorial problem

640
01:01:23,511 --> 01:01:29,368
Right is it's the parents at fault, but so is the child who agrees to do that.

641
01:01:29,368 --> 01:01:37,190
They've got a little cabal going and you might say well it's only the parents fault but the son will

642
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:42,290
be taking advantage of every advantage that offers him because he could say no

643
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:49,630
to I won't do that so anyway so Joseph is the favorite he's a bit of a teacher's

644
01:01:49,811 --> 01:01:54,490
pet that's what it looks like now Israel loved Joseph more than all his colors

645
01:01:54,591 --> 01:01:57,390
because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors

646
01:01:58,912 --> 01:02:04,070
When his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him

647
01:02:04,592 --> 01:02:08,790
So let's say you have a child or a number of children and one of them is your favorite

648
01:02:08,871 --> 01:02:10,265
How should you treat that child?

649
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:16,230
Well, it isn't obvious that you do them any favors by overtly making them your favorite

650
01:02:17,176 --> 01:02:18,070
Right, I mean first of all

651
01:02:18,451 --> 01:02:24,110
Maybe you don't challenge them as much as you should and second of all you definitely set up a Cain and Abel like

652
01:02:24,371 --> 01:02:35,107
Scenario in the household and that or maybe it's an edible situation too because you happen to love your child more than you love your your spouse which is that's not a recipe for familial harmony, so

653
01:02:37,674 --> 01:02:44,490
It seems to be a bad idea okay, so now we have two reasons that Joseph is not liked by his brothers is one is

654
01:02:45,952 --> 01:02:50,190
Well, he's a bit of a rat fink and the other is that he's the he's the favorite

655
01:02:50,331 --> 01:02:55,490
And he's playing that to the hilt by the looks of things and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all

656
01:02:55,570 --> 01:03:00,630
His brethren than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him

657
01:03:01,991 --> 01:03:06,830
Okay, and Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren and they hated him the more

658
01:03:09,157 --> 01:03:17,070
He said unto them here I pray you this dream which I have dreamed for behold we were binding wheat sheaves in the field and lo my sheaf arose and

659
01:03:17,793 --> 01:03:21,130
and behold your sheaf stood round about and bowed to my sheaf and

660
01:03:25,171 --> 01:03:30,110
His and remember he's yet the young one right and and also the daughter of the favorite wife

661
01:03:30,372 --> 01:03:32,550
Which is another thing that's or the son of the favorite wife

662
01:03:32,691 --> 01:03:40,530
Which is another thing not really working in his favor and his brethren said to him shalt thou indeed reign over us or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us and

663
01:03:41,272 --> 01:03:44,590
They hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words well

664
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:49,830
There there's a shock you know that makes perfect sense so when it gets worse so you see here

665
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:55,327
Well, there's the wheat sheaves bowing there, and then you see this.

666
01:03:55,327 --> 01:03:56,170
What's going on here?

667
01:03:56,351 --> 01:03:59,650
Well, that's not the end of his, let's call it, grandiosity.

668
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:07,390
And there's an idea, too, in the Old Testament, especially in the stories of Joseph, that if God sends you a dream twice, he really means it.

669
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:11,650
And so, I don't know if that's true, although I do know that people have repeating dreams.

670
01:04:12,671 --> 01:04:17,890
It might be true that a dream you have twice is really trying to punch something home.

671
01:04:18,051 --> 01:04:21,150
You know it's certainly the case that recurrent nightmares are

672
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:23,790
meaningful and that recurrent nightmares are

673
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:33,564
Associated quite tightly with decreased states of mental health and that if you can treat the nightmare which is often quite easy by the way, then the

674
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:40,090
Some of the mental health problems will decrease so repeated dreams seem to be important anyways

675
01:04:40,512 --> 01:04:43,864
He dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brethren and said behold.

676
01:04:43,864 --> 01:04:45,570
I've had another dream and be and

677
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:52,987
And behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars bowed to me, and he told it to his father and to his brothers.

678
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:57,269
And his father rebuked him and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed?

679
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:03,775
Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee, to the earth?

680
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:13,487
And his brethren envied him, but his father observed the saying, Well, what the hell do you make of something like that, right, if someone tells you that?

681
01:05:14,534 --> 01:05:17,070
It's like are they responsible for their dreams?

682
01:05:18,732 --> 01:05:22,410
We don't really seem we don't really hold ourselves responsible for for the dreams

683
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:27,370
We have at night, then what do you make of a dream is like one of the things that Jung pointed out?

684
01:05:27,571 --> 01:05:29,821
This is where he differed from Freud substantially.

685
01:05:29,821 --> 01:05:31,970
Freud tended to think that the dream

686
01:05:33,173 --> 01:05:40,567
hid its meaning because its contents weren't Acceptable to the conscious mind and Jung said no no you don't understand.

687
01:05:40,567 --> 01:05:47,730
That's not what happens What happens is the dream is doing the best it can to express something that the person doesn't yet really know and

688
01:05:48,432 --> 01:05:51,183
Jung thought about the dream as a manifestation of nature.

689
01:05:51,183 --> 01:05:52,830
It wasn't associated with the ego at all

690
01:05:52,972 --> 01:06:00,190
It was just like you have a dream And there are things happening in it the same way that when you walk into a dinner party there are things happening there

691
01:06:00,755 --> 01:06:06,210
You know it's not The dream isn't something that's subject to your capacity for manipulation

692
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:11,570
It's something that happens to you not something that you do and so so if someone has a dream like that

693
01:06:11,711 --> 01:06:13,318
Well, you've got three options.

694
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:19,870
You can just discount dreams all together which is what people in the modern world tend to do which is a very bad idea because

695
01:06:20,751 --> 01:06:23,127
There are thoughts and you shouldn't discount them.

696
01:06:23,127 --> 01:06:27,009
You know I mean And they're hardly random as some neuroscientists claim.

697
01:06:27,009 --> 01:06:33,770
That's Absolutely cockeyed theory that random be like television snow on a TV set if it was random

698
01:06:34,693 --> 01:06:43,167
So so one is while you just discount dreams the other is that you consider the person a liar and a braggart and a narcissist and the third is

699
01:06:44,591 --> 01:06:45,635
Well, what's the third?

700
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:49,990
It's like he dreamt that the sun and the moon and the stars bowed down to him

701
01:06:52,015 --> 01:06:53,530
You might think about that two or three times

702
01:06:54,613 --> 01:06:57,290
so but it's not necessarily something that's going to make you happy and

703
01:06:58,552 --> 01:07:03,090
His brethren went to feed their father's flock and shechem so they took off and Israel said unto Joseph

704
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:08,470
Do not thy brethren feed the flock and shechem come and I will send thee unto him and he said to him and

705
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:11,290
He said to him here here am I

706
01:07:12,512 --> 01:07:17,870
And when they saw him afar off even before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay him

707
01:07:19,711 --> 01:07:24,590
Rough people back then right this is this sort of thing is happening quite frequently

708
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:35,790
They said to one another behold the dreamer cometh come now therefore and let us slay him cast him into some pit and we will say

709
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:40,710
some evil beast hath devoured him and we shall see what becomes of his dreams so

710
01:07:40,811 --> 01:07:43,850
there's an echo of the Cain and Abel story there obviously you know I mean

711
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:54,870
it's not quite as clear because in the Cain and Abel story Abel is clearly just doing well and here you can't quite get a handle on Joseph's character you can't

712
01:07:54,991 --> 01:08:04,490
tell if he is actually the elect or if he's just a spoiled brat with delusions grandeur you know and but it doesn't matter because his brothers are so

713
01:08:04,671 --> 01:08:16,410
irritated at his the fact that he's favored and perhaps even the fact that he might be someone destined for for something special that they find it

714
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:28,090
perfectly reasonable to destroy that and it's so odd so interesting how often that motif of pulling down an ideal manifests itself in these old stories

715
01:08:28,251 --> 01:08:33,670
Right it's it's the patterns established in the Cain and Abel story just repeats and repeats and repeats

716
01:08:33,771 --> 01:08:35,150
And I think that's dead true

717
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:40,450
I think it just repeats all the time so that people are annoyed about how tragic their lives are

718
01:08:41,013 --> 01:08:43,470
They're annoyed that they're subject to malevolence

719
01:08:44,052 --> 01:08:50,950
And they're annoyed that they're not doing as well as other people are doing and that makes them that puts them exactly into this state

720
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:57,390
Of mind now maybe with modern people if you're gonna kill someone because you're resentful as a modern person

721
01:08:57,672 --> 01:08:59,830
You don't generally slay them and throw them into a pit.

722
01:09:00,351 --> 01:09:06,410
You know, what you do is you just kill them slowly over a few decades, and it isn't obvious to me that that's any better.

723
01:09:07,335 --> 01:09:07,498
So...

724
01:09:08,993 --> 01:09:11,750
I've seen plenty of married couples who were in that situation.

725
01:09:12,791 --> 01:09:17,385
It's like, it's like, yeah, well, there is this Mitch Hedberg.

726
01:09:17,385 --> 01:09:19,070
He used to complain about turtlenecks.

727
01:09:19,191 --> 01:09:22,350
He said it was like being strangled by a really weak midget.

728
01:09:23,112 --> 01:09:29,404
It's probably a really politically incorrect joke, but it's a funny joke.

729
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:36,549
And then you see relationships that are like that.

730
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:42,343
It's like each person has their hands around the neck of the other person, but they don't have enough courage to actually squeeze.

731
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:52,510
They just put enough pressure on to cut the circulation off a tiny bit, so the person just gets like, they die over a 30-year period, something like that.

732
01:09:53,492 --> 01:09:58,028
So yeah, and you all laugh because you know it's true.

733
01:09:58,028 --> 01:09:58,430
That's why.

734
01:10:01,732 --> 01:10:05,390
And we will say some evil beast hath devoured him, which would be true actually.

735
01:10:05,751 --> 01:10:10,990
It would be the evil beast that's inside the brothers, and we shall see what will become of his dreams.

736
01:10:11,532 --> 01:10:13,950
Haha, that's interesting too, because

737
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:19,870
Because, so, they want to spite themselves, because maybe Joseph is something special,

738
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:26,690
and then they want to spite their father, which is probably not the wisest idea, because they owe him some gratitude.

739
01:10:27,152 --> 01:10:31,864
I mean, maybe he's acting like a pain in the neck, there's some evidence for that, but this is a little bit harsh.

740
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:35,126
But they also want to spite God, just like Cain did.

741
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:40,147
Because that's what it means, we shall see what will become of his dreams.

742
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:46,350
Because then, as soon as you're, in some sense, trying to fight against the intuition

743
01:10:46,471 --> 01:10:51,200
of someone, the natural intuition of someone, you've set yourself up against the structure of being itself.

744
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:54,223
And so, pretty bad.

745
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:58,960
And Reuben heard it, and he delivered them out of their hands and said, no, let us not kill him.

746
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:03,700
And Reuben said unto them, shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that's in the wilderness.

747
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:06,038
It's like Reuben's the good guy in this story.

748
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:10,149
And there's no water in the pit, by the way.

749
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:15,855
And lay no hand upon him, that he might rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again."

750
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:20,045
So Reuben was actually trying to save him.

751
01:11:21,313 --> 01:11:24,547
Said, he might rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again.

752
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:31,562
And it came to pass, when Joseph came unto his brethren, that they stripped him of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on him.

753
01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:36,811
And they took him and cast him into a pit, and the pit was empty and there was no water in it.

754
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:50,258
And then they sat down to eat bread, and lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh,

755
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:52,098
going to carry it down to Egypt.

756
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:57,665
And Judas said unto his brethren, How does it profit us if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?"

757
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,712
So he's the practical guy here.

758
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:03,554
Why would we kill him when we can sell him?

759
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:11,780
It's like, Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother and our flesh and his brethren were content

760
01:12:12,985 --> 01:12:20,400
Then they're passed by Midianites merchantmen and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver

761
01:12:21,402 --> 01:12:26,620
It's a amount that echoes through into the future and they brought Joseph into Egypt

762
01:12:26,921 --> 01:12:30,015
I'm never really sure how these slavery stories work.

763
01:12:30,015 --> 01:12:36,380
It's like so it's 2,500 3,000 years ago and I decide I'm gonna sell you to the Ishmaelites and that just works out

764
01:12:36,461 --> 01:12:41,428
They I get the money you get to be a slave, and they take you away I don't really understand how that works.

765
01:12:41,428 --> 01:12:49,000
I can't figure out how people weren't just selling each other all the time, but Maybe if you're family you can do it

766
01:12:53,809 --> 01:13:03,840
so there they sold him and Ruben returned to the pit and behold Joseph was not there and Ruben rent his clothes so Ruben's very upset about this and he

767
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:07,859
returned unto his brothers and said the child is not and I where shall I go and

768
01:13:09,064 --> 01:13:14,100
And they conspired they took Joseph's coat and killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in the blood

769
01:13:14,643 --> 01:13:17,080
That's interesting too because blood is actually another color

770
01:13:18,222 --> 01:13:22,340
Right so he's got this coat of many colors and blood is definitely a color

771
01:13:22,963 --> 01:13:27,220
And so this is the addition in some sense of the color of blood to Joseph's coat

772
01:13:28,025 --> 01:13:30,680
And I would say it's probably a necessary color

773
01:13:31,841 --> 01:13:37,120
Because I don't think that you're serious enough till your coat has been dipped in blood that can happen in many ways

774
01:13:38,503 --> 01:13:41,179
And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father.

775
01:13:42,561 --> 01:13:44,331
And said, so they lied to him.

776
01:13:44,331 --> 01:13:45,980
It's very, very nasty business, this.

777
01:13:47,424 --> 01:13:49,030
They sell his son to slavery.

778
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:50,777
They claim that he's dead.

779
01:13:50,777 --> 01:13:51,460
They lie to him.

780
01:13:52,343 --> 01:13:54,720
They put him into an extreme state of grief.

781
01:13:55,581 --> 01:13:57,908
There's a lot of hatred underneath that, right?

782
01:13:57,908 --> 01:14:02,420
A tremendous amount of hatred for Joseph and also for Jacob.

783
01:14:04,286 --> 01:14:08,340
This we have found know now whether it be thy son's coat or not, and he knew it

784
01:14:08,541 --> 01:14:11,640
He said it's my son's coat an evil beast has devoured him

785
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:19,380
Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces and Jacob tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his loins and mourn for many days and all

786
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:26,470
His sons and daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, and he said I'll go down into my grave mourning my son

787
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:35,230
Thus his father wept for him, so that's Jacob collapsing at the news

788
01:14:41,014 --> 01:14:48,380
And the Midianites sold Joseph into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of pharaohs and captain of the guard, and Joseph was brought down to Egypt.

789
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:55,280
And Potiphar, an officer of pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites, which had brought him down thither.

790
01:14:56,107 --> 01:14:57,319
So now he's a slave.

791
01:14:59,284 --> 01:15:07,340
So now you'd think, well that would be, this is a man who has a lot of reason to be irritated at the structure of reality, right?

792
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:11,494
He's gone from being the favorite to being betrayed by all of his brothers.

793
01:15:11,494 --> 01:15:18,440
That's pretty rough, and then he's Being transformed into a slave and now he's being he's being sold to work as a slave

794
01:15:18,621 --> 01:15:24,440
So you think that that would corrupt his character because you know one of the things I think this is the case anyways

795
01:15:24,782 --> 01:15:28,240
I think people are always looking for an excuse to have their character corrupted

796
01:15:28,841 --> 01:15:33,500
because if your character is corrupted then you get to lie and you get to cheat you get to steal and you get to betray

797
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:37,000
And you get to act resentfully and you get to do nothing and that's all easy

798
01:15:37,681 --> 01:15:39,390
It's easier to lie than to tell the truth.

799
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:41,180
It's easier to do nothing than to do something.

800
01:15:41,584 --> 01:15:43,140
So, there's always part of you thinking,

801
01:15:43,701 --> 01:15:49,860
well, I need a justification for being useless and horrible, because that'd be a lot less work, and so

802
01:15:51,082 --> 01:15:54,040
then, if something terrible comes along, you think, aha!

803
01:15:54,562 --> 01:15:59,140
That's just exactly the excuse that I was waiting for, and then out all that comes.

804
01:16:01,185 --> 01:16:06,780
You know, Solzhenitsyn, when he was in the concentration camps in Russia, watching how people behaved,

805
01:16:07,804 --> 01:16:12,620
You know, he said that there were people that were put in the camps who immediately became trustees or guards

806
01:16:12,761 --> 01:16:17,220
And they were even more vicious than the people who had been hired as guards and his idea was that

807
01:16:18,384 --> 01:16:19,556
They had collected all that

808
01:16:20,926 --> 01:16:26,460
He called it foulness, if I remember correctly, around them in normal life

809
01:16:27,342 --> 01:16:32,020
But they didn't have the opportunity to express it, but as soon as you gave them the opportunity it was like there

810
01:16:32,121 --> 01:16:40,780
it was right away, and so so one of the messages that seems to echo through these old testament stories is that

811
01:16:42,342 --> 01:16:45,740
Just because something terrible happens to you doesn't mean that you get to be

812
01:16:47,242 --> 01:16:50,840
that you get to wander off the path and make things worse and

813
01:16:51,882 --> 01:16:55,240
Maybe it doesn't matter how terrible it is that what happens to you?

814
01:16:56,481 --> 01:17:01,698
That's a tough call you know because you see people now and then in life who they've really got it rough man like 50 bad

815
01:17:02,381 --> 01:17:07,880
things are happening to them at the same time and you think it's no wonder if you are bitter and resentful and hostile be like

816
01:17:08,381 --> 01:17:13,440
Yeah, no wonder, but then you meet people and Solzhenitsyn again talked about this in the Gulag Archipelago

817
01:17:13,501 --> 01:17:15,720
He said he met lots of people in the not lots

818
01:17:16,241 --> 01:17:22,860
He met enough people to impress him in the concentration camp system who didn't allow their misfortunes to corrupt them

819
01:17:23,922 --> 01:17:28,260
And that's something because maybe the only real misfortune is to become corrupted

820
01:17:29,385 --> 01:17:31,355
That's a really useful thing to think.

821
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:32,400
You know, maybe the rest of it

822
01:17:33,663 --> 01:17:35,680
Maybe the rest of it is trivial in comparison

823
01:17:35,801 --> 01:17:39,380
I know that's a rough thing because you can be in very harsh circumstances

824
01:17:39,481 --> 01:17:43,380
But I do think there's something to that and the Lord was with Joseph

825
01:17:43,521 --> 01:17:48,560
and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian and his master saw that the Lord was

826
01:17:48,661 --> 01:17:51,220
With him and that Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand

827
01:17:51,602 --> 01:17:55,260
So that's an echo of the idea that we encountered earlier about walking with God, right?

828
01:17:55,722 --> 01:18:00,580
so Adam walked with God before he ate the fruit with Eve, and then he wouldn't walk with God and

829
01:18:01,442 --> 01:18:05,138
Then Noah walked with God and Abraham walked with God and so the idea is well

830
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:07,791
That's that alignment with the highest ideal.

831
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:09,660
I think it's something like that, and you know

832
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:12,960
We could think about that as a metaphysical claim as well

833
01:18:14,083 --> 01:18:23,940
But I don't think it is I mean I've got Thousands of letters now in the last year from people who have told me that they were in a pit

834
01:18:25,606 --> 01:18:36,620
that's exactly right and that they decided that they were going to try to put their lives together and that it worked and so that's really something

835
01:18:36,882 --> 01:18:43,260
you know and they right surprised it's like well I decided that I was gonna work hard at what I was doing and I wasn't gonna lie any more than

836
01:18:43,421 --> 01:18:51,500
absolutely necessary I thought I'd give it a try for a few months you know and all sorts of good things started to happen to me it's like maybe that's how

837
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:57,300
The world works now obviously it doesn't work like that all the time right because you can get sliced off at the knees

838
01:18:57,581 --> 01:19:00,271
I mean, there's an arbitrary element to existence.

839
01:19:00,271 --> 01:19:10,940
That's that you can't wish away but that doesn't mean that there are It doesn't mean that there aren't bad strategies and good strategies

840
01:19:12,343 --> 01:19:20,300
And so I do think that one of the most fundamental existential questions is like if things aren't going well for you in your life is are you

841
01:19:20,461 --> 01:19:24,080
Absolutely certain that you're doing absolutely everything you can to put things in order

842
01:19:24,921 --> 01:19:29,320
Because if you're not then you shouldn't complain because you don't know to what degree you're actually

843
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,800
Contributing or even causing the circumstance now

844
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:36,140
That's a very annoying thing to think and I'm not trying to blame the victim

845
01:19:36,482 --> 01:19:39,580
You know I know that people end up with lung cancer because they were exposed to asbestos

846
01:19:40,203 --> 01:19:42,460
You know I'm not trying to although

847
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:47,100
I also know too that if you have lung cancer because you've been exposed to asbestos that can be a

848
01:19:47,261 --> 01:19:50,740
Tragedy or it can be hell and to some degree that depends on how you conduct yourself

849
01:19:51,863 --> 01:19:55,180
so I mean I know that's pretty gloomy possibilities right but

850
01:19:57,223 --> 01:19:59,640
so anyway, so Joseph is a slave, but it turns out that

851
01:20:02,443 --> 01:20:05,660
He hasn't sacrificed the integrity of his character, and so it turns out that being

852
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:08,097
It turns out that he's not a slave

853
01:20:09,303 --> 01:20:10,691
It's just that everyone around him thinks.

854
01:20:10,691 --> 01:20:12,060
He's a slave, but he's not

855
01:20:13,124 --> 01:20:14,276
So that's pretty interesting

856
01:20:16,042 --> 01:20:17,792
He was a goodly person and well favored.

857
01:20:17,792 --> 01:20:22,399
Well, so he's a good guy and he's an impressive specimen as well

858
01:20:23,383 --> 01:20:26,260
This is pretty interesting given the current political climate

859
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:31,820
I would say and it came to pass after these things that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph

860
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:36,620
And she said lie with me that means that actually has two meanings, right?

861
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:46,470
But he refused and said unto his master's wife behold my master

862
01:20:48,356 --> 01:20:53,090
Does not know what's with me in the house, and he's committed all that he has to my hand

863
01:20:54,954 --> 01:21:02,660
There's no one greater in this house than I Neither have he kept back anything from me, but you Because you are his wife.

864
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:04,330
How then can I do this great wickedness?

865
01:21:05,171 --> 01:21:14,940
wickedness and sin against God and It came to pass as she spake to Joseph day by day that he hearken not unto her to lie by her or

866
01:21:15,643 --> 01:21:18,400
Be with her it's being sexually harassed Joseph

867
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:24,180
And it came to pass, well it's right, I mean look, look at the painting.

868
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:36,600
And it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do his business, and there was none of the men of the house there within.

869
01:21:37,821 --> 01:21:40,119
And she caught him by his garment, saying, lie with me.

870
01:21:40,861 --> 01:21:43,899
And he left his garment in her hand and fled, and got him out.

871
01:21:44,741 --> 01:21:48,119
So, that's kind of embarrassing for poor Joseph, I would say.

872
01:21:48,701 --> 01:21:50,899
And a bit on the suspicious side.

873
01:21:51,301 --> 01:21:55,640
And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,

874
01:21:56,002 --> 01:21:58,620
that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them,

875
01:21:58,841 --> 01:22:01,709
See, see, he hath brought in a Hebrew to mock us.

876
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:05,639
He came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.

877
01:22:07,845 --> 01:22:08,326
What is it?

878
01:22:08,326 --> 01:22:10,793
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

879
01:22:10,793 --> 01:22:13,660
That's the proper commentary on that.

880
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:19,539
And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice, and cried that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got himself out.

881
01:22:21,007 --> 01:22:23,420
And it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife

882
01:22:23,741 --> 01:22:28,480
So that's the Pharaoh which she spake unto him saying after this manner did thy servant to me

883
01:22:29,402 --> 01:22:34,580
His wrath was kindled and Joseph's master took him and put him in prison a place where the king's prisoners were

884
01:22:35,062 --> 01:22:37,913
Was were bound and he was there in the prison.

885
01:22:37,913 --> 01:22:39,219
Well that sort of sucks.

886
01:22:39,219 --> 01:22:39,500
It's like

887
01:22:41,002 --> 01:22:43,960
first his brothers betray him and throw him in a pit and then he

888
01:22:44,683 --> 01:22:47,300
Gets made a slave which is probably better than being in the pit

889
01:22:47,501 --> 01:22:52,880
And then he becomes sort of like kingslave so that's working out pretty well, and now someone lies about him

890
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:57,440
He gets betrayed again, and now it's into the prison with him, and so it's this it's this again, right?

891
01:22:57,721 --> 01:22:58,625
It's the same thing.

892
01:22:58,625 --> 01:23:04,035
It's Sisyphus up with the rock and then down and it's order Chaos

893
01:23:04,701 --> 01:23:11,080
Order Chaos and and you have to think well are you the order are you the Chaos are you the thing that's moving between them?

894
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:13,519
Because that's the right thing to be

895
01:23:14,324 --> 01:23:21,779
because otherwise you're just order and that's a really bad idea or you're just chaos and that's a really bad idea you can be the thing that's dynamically

896
01:23:22,301 --> 01:23:27,980
mediating between them and that's what he's doing but the Lord was with Joseph

897
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:31,360
and showed him mercy and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison

898
01:23:32,083 --> 01:23:40,260
that's no easy thing to do I would think you know it's like you're thrown in prison and now the jailer likes you now how exactly are you going to manage that

899
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:44,940
But it's a good thing to think about because you might think well if you were really in dire straits

900
01:23:45,121 --> 01:23:50,500
How is it that you should conduct yourself so that you have the highest probability of having things work out?

901
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:58,260
And it's not saying well Joseph took over the thumbscrew you know and started using that on the other prisoners that that's not the

902
01:23:58,340 --> 01:23:59,466
Indication here at all.

903
01:23:59,466 --> 01:24:01,156
It's that he's doing something.

904
01:24:01,156 --> 01:24:04,253
He's acting like a Person who isn't a prisoner

905
01:24:05,562 --> 01:24:09,219
Even though he's in the prison just like he was acting like someone who wasn't a slave when he was a slave

906
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:24,760
and so it makes you wonder who you can be despite the fact that other people think that you're whatever you appear to be and the keeper of the prison

907
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,660
committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and

908
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:34,340
whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it the keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand because the Lord was with him

909
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:48,951
and that which he did the Lord made it to prosper so it's a repeat it's a repeat of exactly what happened when he was the slave of the Pharaoh except it's one rung deeper into hell, so to speak, right?

910
01:24:48,951 --> 01:24:52,565
So it's slave Pharaoh, and here it's prisoner, jail master.

911
01:24:52,565 --> 01:24:54,833
But it doesn't matter, the same thing happens.

912
01:24:54,833 --> 01:25:03,183
So now Joseph is in prison, and the Pharaoh has a fit one day of pique, and throws the chief of his butlers into prison, and the chief of his bakers.

913
01:25:03,183 --> 01:25:05,148
And they have a dream, each of them.

914
01:25:05,148 --> 01:25:11,625
And Joseph interprets the dreams, which seems to be something that he can do.

915
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:20,338
And he tells the butler that his dream means that the Pharaoh is going to forgive him and put him back in his position.

916
01:25:20,338 --> 01:25:27,670
And he tells the baker that the Pharaoh isn't going to forgive him and that he's going to take off his head and hang him in a tree.

917
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:32,368
Which is a rather rough dream, but that is what happens.

918
01:25:32,368 --> 01:25:35,180
So anyways, the baker or the butler goes free.

919
01:25:35,361 --> 01:25:38,818
Joseph says, look, you know, maybe you could just keep in mind the fact that I

920
01:25:40,543 --> 01:25:43,160
Did you a bit of a favor here and told you something that was accurate?

921
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:49,868
But the chief didn't really remember once he once he was freed interpreting

922
01:25:50,981 --> 01:25:56,950
dreams in prison and so now the Pharaoh has a dream and

923
01:25:58,513 --> 01:26:01,350
He actually has two dreams, so it's another one of those double motifs

924
01:26:01,591 --> 01:26:05,570
so the idea is these are really important dreams because they came in a pair and

925
01:26:07,091 --> 01:26:12,670
behold there came out of the river seven well favored kind and fat-fleshed so cattle and

926
01:26:13,571 --> 01:26:20,650
They fed the meadow meadow and behold seven other cattle came up after them out of the river ill favored and lean-fleshed

927
01:26:21,690 --> 01:26:27,790
Starving and stood by the other cows on the brink of the river and the ill favored and lean-fleshed kind

928
01:26:28,432 --> 01:26:33,999
Did eat up the seven well favored and fat so Pharaoh awoke.

929
01:26:33,999 --> 01:26:36,869
Fair enough, it's a pretty nasty dream.

930
01:26:36,869 --> 01:26:40,944
And then he has another dream, to hit it home.

931
01:26:40,944 --> 01:26:46,965
And he slept and dreamt the second time, and behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.

932
01:26:46,965 --> 01:26:51,907
And behold, seven thin ears, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.

933
01:26:51,907 --> 01:26:55,523
And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.

934
01:26:55,523 --> 01:26:57,070
And Pharaoh awoke and beheld it was

935
01:26:57,411 --> 01:27:02,490
And then it says a little later and for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice

936
01:27:03,013 --> 01:27:06,430
It is because the thing is established by God and God will shortly bring it to pass

937
01:27:07,112 --> 01:27:11,210
it's interesting you know because one of the better theories about dreams is that

938
01:27:12,033 --> 01:27:14,590
They're part of the way that the right and left hemisphere communicate

939
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:20,110
or maybe the nonverbal part of the brain communicates with the verbal brain verbal part of the brain and so

940
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:28,170
the nonverbal part of the brain which is less differentiated and thinks more globally is looking for patterns and

941
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:33,390
anomalies in the world things that don't fit well with the current way of

942
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:40,090
conceptualizing the world things that make you anxious and uncertain and those are things you haven't mastered right so they don't fit well into your

943
01:27:40,830 --> 01:27:45,050
Conceptualization of the world by definition because if you had mastered them

944
01:27:45,130 --> 01:27:50,390
They wouldn't make you anxious and nervous and so the the nonverbal parts of your brain are like an alarm system

945
01:27:50,791 --> 01:27:56,350
They're looking around for places where you're probably wrong, and then they put those in images and try to

946
01:27:57,530 --> 01:28:01,730
Conceptualize them so that you can update your model of reality to take them into account

947
01:28:02,112 --> 01:28:05,490
But that also produces a fair bit of negative emotion especially at night

948
01:28:11,134 --> 01:28:18,758
So we know that we know if you deprive people of dreams that they go insane very rapidly animals as well necessary part of mental equilibrium

949
01:28:19,502 --> 01:28:24,280
The way you do that with rats, in case you want to know, is that you've got rats that you want to drive insane

950
01:28:24,461 --> 01:28:25,750
This is how you do it.

951
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:31,340
So you put the rat on a like a pedestal that's pretty small, and then when you fall

952
01:28:31,622 --> 01:28:38,440
it's surrounded by water, and then when he falls asleep his nose hits the water, and then he wakes up, and so you can deprive the rat of sleep and

953
01:28:39,122 --> 01:28:44,140
that doesn't, the rats don't respond to that very well after some period of time, so

954
01:28:45,364 --> 01:28:48,265
that's one of the ways that that's been discovered.

955
01:28:48,265 --> 01:28:51,338
But anyways, the dream does seem to be an update mechanism.

956
01:28:51,338 --> 01:28:56,700
And so, if you have a very powerful dream, like a nightmare, especially if it's repeating,

957
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:00,739
it's like something is trying to hammer on the door that needs to be let in.

958
01:29:00,739 --> 01:29:03,153
And often you don't know how to let it in.

959
01:29:03,153 --> 01:29:03,940
That's a problem.

960
01:29:04,864 --> 01:29:05,349
So, but...

961
01:29:07,263 --> 01:29:13,671
Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, because he had talked to his his butler, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon.

962
01:29:13,671 --> 01:29:18,830
And Joseph shaved himself and changed his clothes and came in unto Pharaoh."

963
01:29:18,830 --> 01:29:22,586
I guess he didn't want to shock Pharaoh with how people dressed in the prison.

964
01:29:22,586 --> 01:29:26,227
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I've dreamed a dream and there's none that can interpret it.

965
01:29:26,227 --> 01:29:29,002
I've heard say of thee that you can understand a dream to interpret it.

966
01:29:29,002 --> 01:29:31,772
And Joseph said, it's not me.

967
01:29:31,772 --> 01:29:35,225
God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

968
01:29:35,225 --> 01:29:39,100
So Jacob isn't taking credit for his ability to interpret dreams.

969
01:29:39,381 --> 01:29:46,108
Which also indicates quite interestingly, there's nothing, despite the that he's successful and competent.

970
01:29:46,108 --> 01:29:47,313
He's not narcissistic.

971
01:29:47,313 --> 01:29:54,000
Like, if he happens to have this gift, he regards it as a gift, and not as something that, you know, redounds to his favor.

972
01:29:54,221 --> 01:29:56,731
It's just something that he happens to be able to do.

973
01:29:56,731 --> 01:30:02,299
And so that's, that's a hallmark of someone who's got a pretty well put together personality, as far as I'm concerned.

974
01:30:02,299 --> 01:30:07,688
Because, you know, people have gifts that they didn't really earn.

975
01:30:07,688 --> 01:30:12,039
Those would be your talents, your intelligence, your good looks, if you happen to have good looks, etc.

976
01:30:12,901 --> 01:30:19,700
And there's no sense being all puffed up about that, because it's great, it's luck of the draw, though.

977
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:24,199
And the proper attitude is to note that it's luck of the draw and to be grateful for it.

978
01:30:30,928 --> 01:30:32,350
It's quite a fine painting, that one.

979
01:30:36,398 --> 01:30:42,110
Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout the land of Egypt, and then there shall arise after them seven years of famine,

980
01:30:42,271 --> 01:30:45,329
and all the plenty shall be forgotten, and the famine shall consume the land.

981
01:30:45,992 --> 01:30:51,549
And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following, for it shall be very grievous.

982
01:30:54,279 --> 01:30:57,090
So now we see too that Jacob he can interpret dreams

983
01:30:57,230 --> 01:31:02,770
But he's also the sort of person who can look into the future and think this is sort of what Adam was called on

984
01:31:03,232 --> 01:31:08,050
To do when he got kicked out of the Garden of Paradise is you're going to be able to conceptualize that

985
01:31:08,694 --> 01:31:14,010
Even if things are going well now That that doesn't mean that they're going to go well into the future and so

986
01:31:14,812 --> 01:31:18,690
He's the ant and not the grasshopper right in the grasshopper in the ant story

987
01:31:18,812 --> 01:31:25,730
It's like everything's good but you should wake the hell up and you should test to see how things can go wrong and you can see if your

988
01:31:25,871 --> 01:31:36,290
Systems can survive them things going wrong and which is something that I think we could all harken to because I think we do a very bad job in the modern world of

989
01:31:36,351 --> 01:31:38,250
Testing to see if our systems can go wrong

990
01:31:42,681 --> 01:31:46,400
Okay, so the Pharaoh is pretty impressed by this dream interpretation and pretty worried about it

991
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:49,700
And I guess he's a reasonable person despite the fact that he put Joseph in jail

992
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:51,660
I guess he didn't have much choice

993
01:31:53,382 --> 01:31:58,480
Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of Egypt

994
01:31:59,023 --> 01:32:01,640
Let Pharaoh do this and let him appoint officers over the land

995
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:08,000
this is what Joseph is saying and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years and

996
01:32:11,012 --> 01:32:16,864
let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities and

997
01:32:19,173 --> 01:32:21,350
Just like that Joseph has restored to his position

998
01:32:23,155 --> 01:32:29,889
So, the Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all of the land of Egypt.

999
01:32:29,970 --> 01:32:36,528
And so he comes out of the prison, and he really, in some sense, as far as I'm concerned,

1000
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:40,330
he actually occupies a position that's higher than the position of the Pharaoh.

1001
01:32:40,330 --> 01:32:45,363
It depends on how you look at it, because the Pharaoh has relegated himself to ceremonial status, right?

1002
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:50,747
Joseph has all the responsibility, makes all the decisions, so de facto, he's the Pharaoh.

1003
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:55,069
He doesn't get the glory, precisely, although he's not doing too bad for himself.

1004
01:32:55,513 --> 01:32:57,024
And there's a lesson in that, too.

1005
01:32:58,753 --> 01:33:07,629
I wrote these rules for Quora a long time ago, and one of them—I've written some of them into this book you guys got a pamphlet about today—one of the rules that I didn't

1006
01:33:08,091 --> 01:33:15,268
write about was, note that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated.

1007
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:17,589
Which is really interesting, I think.

1008
01:33:18,072 --> 01:33:21,248
I mean, I've seen people in their jobs, they say things like, well, my…

1009
01:33:21,751 --> 01:33:23,246
The guy I work with doesn't do any work.

1010
01:33:24,471 --> 01:33:25,663
It's like, well, you could do it.

1011
01:33:26,734 --> 01:33:31,649
I mean, I know there's limits to that, but one of the things you can do at work is make yourself indispensable.

1012
01:33:32,132 --> 01:33:43,408
I mean, you might get the cane types against you if you do that, but there's something to be said for being indispensable, because when people start to be dispensed with, you probably won't be one of them.

1013
01:33:43,831 --> 01:33:48,889
Or even if you are, then the fact that you're indispensable just means you can go somewhere else and be indispensable there.

1014
01:33:49,232 --> 01:33:50,303
And that's just as useful.

1015
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:59,370
So, it's very, very difficult to permanently put down someone who's really good at doing things.

1016
01:34:00,033 --> 01:34:02,027
Because they can just go off and do them somewhere else.

1017
01:34:02,831 --> 01:34:09,249
And one of the ways that you get like that is to take responsibility when someone else is failing to do so.

1018
01:34:09,792 --> 01:34:11,402
And you think, well I shouldn't have to do that.

1019
01:34:11,402 --> 01:34:12,550
That's one way of thinking about it.

1020
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:15,547
Another way of thinking about it is, oh good, I get to do that.

1021
01:34:18,018 --> 01:34:21,050
And the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of Egypt were ended.

1022
01:34:21,310 --> 01:34:28,620
And the seven years of dearth began to come according as joseph has said and the dearth was in all the lands

1023
01:34:29,461 --> 01:34:33,933
Well, that's an archetypal story right in the archetypal story.

1024
01:34:33,933 --> 01:34:35,638
It's the business cycle story.

1025
01:34:35,638 --> 01:34:40,420
It's a little harsher When you're starving obviously, but that's not the point the point is is that?

1026
01:34:41,781 --> 01:34:44,400
Sometimes things are getting good and sometimes things are getting bad

1027
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:51,200
And that's you can be sure that that's the case that's going to happen to you and so the wise person takes

1028
01:34:52,761 --> 01:34:57,519
stock of the fact that things are going to get bad, is this is the same thing that happens with Noah.

1029
01:34:57,841 --> 01:35:02,397
It's like, assume the flood, because it's going to happen.

1030
01:35:02,397 --> 01:35:04,464
And you think, well it's a hell of a world that has floods.

1031
01:35:04,464 --> 01:35:07,252
It's like, not if you have a boat, right?

1032
01:35:07,252 --> 01:35:10,703
It helps a lot if there's a flood and you have a boat.

1033
01:35:10,703 --> 01:35:14,659
It's like, you can float on the flood, and then it's not such a problem.

1034
01:35:14,659 --> 01:35:14,880
And so,

1035
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:32,760
So if you refuse to look at the fact that things are going to be going downhill badly and that you're going to be in a pit at some point, you and your family perhaps, then when it happens it will be as bad as it possibly can be.

1036
01:35:33,442 --> 01:35:39,880
But if you're awake and alert to that possibility then you can mitigate it.

1037
01:35:44,173 --> 01:35:46,300
And the dearth was in all the lands, but in the land of Egypt

1038
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:54,195
there was bread and when the land of Egypt was famished the people cried to Pharaoh for bread and Pharaoh said unto the Egyptians go to Joseph

1039
01:35:54,802 --> 01:35:59,760
What he says to you to do you do that and the famine was all over the face of the earth and Joe

1040
01:36:00,101 --> 01:36:07,040
Joseph opened up the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt and all the countries came into

1041
01:36:07,201 --> 01:36:09,500
Egypt to buy to Joseph to buy

1042
01:36:09,621 --> 01:36:13,220
by corn, because the famine was sore in all the lands.

1043
01:36:15,022 --> 01:36:18,980
Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons,

1044
01:36:20,181 --> 01:36:22,489
Why are you standing around looking at each other?

1045
01:36:22,489 --> 01:36:24,716
He said, I've heard that there's corn in Egypt.

1046
01:36:24,716 --> 01:36:30,177
Get down there and buy for us so that we may live and not die.

1047
01:36:30,177 --> 01:36:33,809
It's like pretty straightforward advice, that.

1048
01:36:33,809 --> 01:36:36,580
And Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy corn in Egypt.

1049
01:36:37,845 --> 01:36:40,757
But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, so that's the youngest one, right?

1050
01:36:40,757 --> 01:36:47,565
The only one left that's the one that was younger than Joseph, the only youngest one, and also Rachel's other son.

1051
01:36:47,565 --> 01:36:52,320
But Benjamin Joseph's brother, Jacob, didn't send because he was worried that

1052
01:36:53,461 --> 01:36:56,760
something bad would happen to him, which kind of indicates to me that maybe

1053
01:36:57,481 --> 01:37:03,920
Jacob was a bit suspicious about what had happened to Joseph the last time he sent all the brothers on an adventure.

1054
01:37:05,901 --> 01:37:07,959
Joseph was the governor over all the land and and

1055
01:37:08,982 --> 01:37:12,860
He it was that sold to all the people of the land and Joseph's brothers came and bowed down

1056
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:15,775
Themselves before him with their faces to the earth.

1057
01:37:15,775 --> 01:37:19,839
Well, there's the dream now the thing is too is that

1058
01:37:22,302 --> 01:37:26,960
One question you have in your life is who should you bow down to and you might say no one

1059
01:37:27,762 --> 01:37:32,680
That's not exactly the right answer because that means that you don't have an ideal because you bow down to your ideal

1060
01:37:33,062 --> 01:37:36,379
That's what makes it an ideal, and if you don't have an ideal then what the hell are you gonna do?

1061
01:37:37,022 --> 01:37:40,580
So you have to bow down to something and so what happens here is well

1062
01:37:41,943 --> 01:37:44,380
The brothers are bowing down to the person who's so bloody

1063
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:49,294
resilient and competent that they can take themselves out of a prison and become the ruler of the land.

1064
01:37:49,294 --> 01:37:51,887
That happened to Vaclav Havel, right, in Czechoslovakia.

1065
01:37:51,887 --> 01:37:56,485
It also happened to Mandela in South Africa.

1066
01:37:56,485 --> 01:37:58,651
Like these things actually happen.

1067
01:37:58,651 --> 01:37:59,934
It's really something.

1068
01:37:59,934 --> 01:38:02,080
So God only knows what you might learn in prison.

1069
01:38:03,181 --> 01:38:12,680
So, so they bow down to Joseph and properly so you know he's he is even without his coat

1070
01:38:12,881 --> 01:38:17,500
He's still the person with the coat of many colors and Joseph saw his brothers, and he knew them

1071
01:38:17,682 --> 01:38:19,380
But he made themselves strange unto them

1072
01:38:19,682 --> 01:38:22,460
It's a number of years have passed and he spoke roughly unto them

1073
01:38:22,540 --> 01:38:27,320
And he said unto them where do you come from and they said from the land of Canaan to buy food?

1074
01:38:28,381 --> 01:38:37,170
And Joseph knew whose brothers were but they didn't know who he was and they came back to Jacob their father and told him all

1075
01:38:37,290 --> 01:38:42,470
that befell him and said the man who's Lord of the country spoke roughly to us and took us for spies and

1076
01:38:43,293 --> 01:38:58,141
We said to him we're we're true men Honest men we're not spies we be twelve brothers sons of our fathers one is not and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan and the man said

1077
01:38:58,932 --> 01:39:02,930
Here's how I'll know that you're honest men leave one of the brothers here with me and take some food

1078
01:39:03,854 --> 01:39:07,670
for the famine of your hostels and be gone and then bring your youngest brother to me.

1079
01:39:09,315 --> 01:39:10,368
Then I'll know that you're not spies,

1080
01:39:10,851 --> 01:39:15,670
but that you're honest men, and I'll deliver the other brother and ye shall trade in the land.

1081
01:39:15,933 --> 01:39:17,510
So you don't have to starve to death.

1082
01:39:17,610 --> 01:39:23,270
And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that behold every man's bundle of money was in his sack.

1083
01:39:23,431 --> 01:39:26,904
And when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.

1084
01:39:26,904 --> 01:39:32,930
So they had bought food from Joseph and he gave them the food and then he put all their money back in their sacks

1085
01:39:33,873 --> 01:39:37,661
which I could imagine would worry them to some degree and Jacob said

1086
01:39:38,732 --> 01:39:42,550
Me you have already bereaved of my children Joseph is not as Simeon is not now

1087
01:39:42,691 --> 01:39:46,350
you'll take Benjamin Benjamin away all these things are against me and

1088
01:39:47,091 --> 01:39:53,570
Reuben spake unto his father saying slay my two sons if I bring him not to thee Deliver him into my hand and I will bring him to thee again

1089
01:39:53,570 --> 01:40:02,096
and he and he said no my son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he's left alone if Mischief befall him by the way

1090
01:40:03,262 --> 01:40:07,920
In the which you shall go then you shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave now

1091
01:40:08,681 --> 01:40:15,800
There's a hint see what happens in the last part of the Jacob story the Joseph story is and this is associated with the idea of

1092
01:40:17,081 --> 01:40:21,100
Putting your house in order your individual house in order and then putting your family's house in order

1093
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:26,659
let's say reversed a little bit in this story because joseph puts himself together, and then he puts the state of of

1094
01:40:28,361 --> 01:40:33,940
Egypt in order which is really quite interesting because egypt is the canonical tyranny right in the old testament

1095
01:40:34,382 --> 01:40:43,480
And so the idea is very very clear here that the person who wears the coat of many colors Can put the tyranny right and then the next extension is well

1096
01:40:43,561 --> 01:40:45,060
He has to put his family right now

1097
01:40:45,281 --> 01:40:50,440
You know generally the progression would be put yourself right then put your family right then put the state right something like that

1098
01:40:50,802 --> 01:40:53,072
It doesn't really if you can do it in a different order.

1099
01:40:53,072 --> 01:40:59,240
That's probably okay, too, but So so that's what happens at the end of the story is that you know?

1100
01:41:01,141 --> 01:41:05,920
Joseph is doing pretty damn well, and so is the state that he serves, but that isn't good enough for him

1101
01:41:06,582 --> 01:41:13,959
He wants his family to be functional and put together properly even though they did terrible things to him and

1102
01:41:15,205 --> 01:41:18,980
And that's very interesting because once someone does terrible things to you

1103
01:41:19,141 --> 01:41:26,896
Then the logical thing or a logical thing to think is well go to hell in a handbasket you know like you deserve exactly what you get but

1104
01:41:31,809 --> 01:41:39,800
It's not a very productive attitude especially if you're around people that you have to be around you know so like if it's your family and

1105
01:41:41,422 --> 01:41:44,940
You go have a family dinner and one of you punches the other and then the other punches you back

1106
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,139
And then that's like the family dinner for the next 30 years

1107
01:41:48,002 --> 01:41:52,080
It doesn't seem to be very productive even if you're the person who happened to get in the last blow

1108
01:41:52,802 --> 01:41:55,540
Because you're gonna have to put up with them at minimum

1109
01:41:56,382 --> 01:41:59,737
It might be nice to just let what you can go go and work to make

1110
01:42:01,241 --> 01:42:07,260
Towards making things better you have to get rid of the idea of revenge and resentment and all those things that you carry along

1111
01:42:07,581 --> 01:42:16,940
But but it's probably better to think about how your family could be if it was really functioning well

1112
01:42:17,181 --> 01:42:19,768
And then just aim unerringly at that.

1113
01:42:19,768 --> 01:42:21,412
I know that's not easy.

1114
01:42:21,412 --> 01:42:32,214
I mean people are very screwy and there's no end to the depths of Pathology within families, but of course this story states that very clearly.

1115
01:42:32,214 --> 01:42:36,105
I mean they tried to kill him They sold him into slavery.

1116
01:42:36,105 --> 01:42:38,511
It's it's a pathological family.

1117
01:42:38,511 --> 01:42:50,500
Let's put it that way and but Joseph's attitude is Well, we got to set this right not least because of his father, but it isn't only because of his father, as you see as the story unfolds.

1118
01:42:50,841 --> 01:42:57,195
And the famine was sore in the land, and it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn, which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them,

1119
01:42:57,923 --> 01:42:59,317
Go again and buy us a little food.

1120
01:43:00,204 --> 01:43:08,020
And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, You will not see my face, except your brother be with you.

1121
01:43:08,221 --> 01:43:09,952
They can't go back to Egypt without Benjamin.

1122
01:43:11,702 --> 01:43:17,140
And they said the man asked us straightly of our state and of our kindred saying is your father yet alive?

1123
01:43:17,442 --> 01:43:20,920
Have you another brother and we told him according to the tenor of those words

1124
01:43:21,941 --> 01:43:28,360
Could we know that he would say bring your brother down and Judah said unto Israel his father send the lad with me

1125
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:32,920
And will arise and go that we may live and not die both we and thou and also our little ones

1126
01:43:33,344 --> 01:43:42,019
I will be surety for him Of my hand shalt thou require him, if I bring him not unto thee and set them before thee, then let me bear the blame forever."

1127
01:43:44,405 --> 01:43:51,278
Well, so Judah, who played a pretty dismal role in the original selling Joseph into slavery,

1128
01:43:52,060 --> 01:44:00,740
seems to obviously have learned something by this point, since he's willing to put himself on the line, you know, to take responsibility for the situation, and to put himself on the line,

1129
01:44:00,901 --> 01:44:03,298
and to stand in for Benjamin.

1130
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:06,737
So he's making himself into a sacrificial object of sorts.

1131
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:14,838
And so, the game that Joseph's playing, because he's sort of teasing his brothers,

1132
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:18,258
but he's also testing them, the game that he's playing is twofold.

1133
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:23,252
One is, have you bloody well learned anything, or are you just as corrupt and useless as you were before?

1134
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:24,535
That's game number one.

1135
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:29,460
And game number two is, maybe if I poke and prod you and put you into a relatively difficult

1136
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:34,900
and mysterious situation, I can get you to clue the hell in and adopt some responsibility,

1137
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:40,896
We can move this whole mess forward and so that seems to be happening so Judah is taking

1138
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:46,660
responsibility and Reuben did that as well and the men took presents and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin and rose up

1139
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:51,520
And went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph and when Joseph saw Benjamin with them

1140
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:58,140
He said to the ruler of his house bring these men home and slay and make ready food for these men shall dine with me

1141
01:44:58,220 --> 01:45:02,540
At noon and the men man did as Joseph bade and the man brought the man into Joseph's house

1142
01:45:04,146 --> 01:45:10,797
And when Joseph came home, they brought him the presence which was in their hand and bowed themselves again to him to the earth.

1143
01:45:11,962 --> 01:45:15,680
And he asked them of their welfare and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom you spake?

1144
01:45:16,682 --> 01:45:17,344
Whom you spake?

1145
01:45:17,344 --> 01:45:18,207
Is he yet alive?

1146
01:45:18,207 --> 01:45:21,540
And they answered, Thy servant, our father, is in good health.

1147
01:45:21,842 --> 01:45:22,627
He's yet alive.

1148
01:45:22,627 --> 01:45:24,720
And they bowed down their heads and made obeisance.

1149
01:45:29,151 --> 01:45:36,391
And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, is this your younger brother of whom you spake unto me?

1150
01:45:36,391 --> 01:45:45,620
And he said, God be gracious unto thee my son, and Joseph made haste, for his bowels did yearn upon his brother, and he sought where to weep, and

1151
01:45:46,882 --> 01:45:52,440
he entered into his chamber and wept there, and he washed his face and went out and refrained himself, and said, set on the bread.

1152
01:45:53,723 --> 01:45:55,051
And they sat before them.

1153
01:45:55,051 --> 01:45:56,440
Now he plays another trick on his brother,

1154
01:45:56,641 --> 01:45:59,999
so he has them all sit at the table, but he lines them up according to age.

1155
01:46:00,907 --> 01:46:02,099
And so he's trying to

1156
01:46:03,642 --> 01:46:04,487
What is he trying to do?

1157
01:46:04,487 --> 01:46:06,940
He's trying to freak them out, fundamentally.

1158
01:46:08,422 --> 01:46:14,280
And so he manages that, because they have no idea how in the world they could possibly, he could possibly pull something like that off.

1159
01:46:14,401 --> 01:46:15,714
They think it's magic.

1160
01:46:15,714 --> 01:46:18,227
And the men marveled at one another.

1161
01:46:18,227 --> 01:46:21,180
And he took and sent messes unto them from before him.

1162
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:24,917
But Benjamin's mess was five times as much as any of theirs.

1163
01:46:24,917 --> 01:46:25,620
So what's he doing?

1164
01:46:26,344 --> 01:46:28,214
Well, he's testing his brothers again.

1165
01:46:28,214 --> 01:46:38,252
The fact that when he was the child Joseph that he got more meant that his brothers got terribly jealous and then murderous, right?

1166
01:46:38,252 --> 01:46:40,138
And so now he's doing the same thing with Benjamin.

1167
01:46:40,138 --> 01:46:40,860
He's thinking, okay

1168
01:46:40,921 --> 01:46:52,159
well, I'll give this kid more than his share and I'll watch how these reprobates behave and see if they've learned anything.

1169
01:46:53,844 --> 01:46:58,999
And he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the men's sack with food as much as they can carry and put every man's

1170
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:05,860
money in the sack as well and put my cup the silver cup in the sack's mouth of the youngest and his corn money and

1171
01:47:07,222 --> 01:47:14,085
The steward did according to the word that joseph had spoken as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away along with their transportation

1172
01:47:18,770 --> 01:47:20,656
The cup is found in Benjamin's sack.

1173
01:47:20,656 --> 01:47:33,888
Well, so Benjamin's kind of young and Joseph sends out people to find out where the cup is gone, and they find it in Benjamin's in Benjamin's sack and

1174
01:47:34,674 --> 01:47:41,250
They're very upset about this They said that a harsh punishment would befall whoever had the cup in his sack

1175
01:47:42,152 --> 01:47:45,290
They rent their clothes and laid it every man his ass and returned to this city

1176
01:47:46,213 --> 01:47:53,416
Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house, for he was there yet there, and they fell before him on the ground, very unhappy and apologetic.

1177
01:47:53,416 --> 01:47:56,268
And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that you have done?

1178
01:47:57,992 --> 01:48:00,849
Don't you know that a man like I can certainly divine?

1179
01:48:01,794 --> 01:48:03,461
I know what's going on.

1180
01:48:03,461 --> 01:48:04,947
And Judah said, What shall we say?

1181
01:48:04,947 --> 01:48:05,650
What shall we speak?

1182
01:48:05,850 --> 01:48:08,136
Or how can we possibly clear ourselves?

1183
01:48:08,136 --> 01:48:11,003
God found out the iniquity of thy servants.

1184
01:48:11,003 --> 01:48:17,823
Behold, we are your servants, both we and also he with whom the cup is found.

1185
01:48:17,823 --> 01:48:25,470
And he said, God forbid that I should do so, but the man in whose cup, in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant.

1186
01:48:25,470 --> 01:48:31,198
And as for you, get you up in peace to your father.

1187
01:48:31,198 --> 01:48:32,540
It's the discovery of the cup.

1188
01:48:39,593 --> 01:48:44,827
Judas says, now therefore when I come to the servant thy father, my father and the lad, be not with us.

1189
01:48:44,827 --> 01:48:51,594
Seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life, it shall come to pass when he sees that the lad is not with us, that he will die.

1190
01:48:51,594 --> 01:48:57,523
And the servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant or father with sorrow to the grave.

1191
01:48:57,523 --> 01:49:05,297
For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father forever.

1192
01:49:05,297 --> 01:49:13,085
Now therefore, I pray thee, let me stay instead of the lad, and let the lad go with his brothers.

1193
01:49:13,085 --> 01:49:21,439
For how shall I go up to my brother, and the lad be not with me? me, lest peradventure I shall see the evil that will come on my father."

1194
01:49:21,439 --> 01:49:22,583
Okay, so what's happened?

1195
01:49:22,583 --> 01:49:24,790
Well, they learned their lesson.

1196
01:49:24,790 --> 01:49:32,034
So now Judah again is willing to stand in the place of Benjamin and become a slave himself.

1197
01:49:32,034 --> 01:49:43,353
And so now Joseph has determined that his brothers have developed their character to the point where reconciliation might be possible.

1198
01:49:43,353 --> 01:49:53,059
You know, it says you should forgive and forget, but the conditions for that are quite specific.

1199
01:49:53,059 --> 01:50:01,838
You know, if you have a dispute with someone, and they've wronged you in some sense, and they apologize, the question is, well, what's the apology?

1200
01:50:01,838 --> 01:50:04,409
Well, it's a layout of a rationale.

1201
01:50:04,409 --> 01:50:11,240
It's something like, as far as I can tell, here's the reasons I did this horrible thing, and here's what I've learned from it, and

1202
01:50:11,701 --> 01:50:16,760
And here's what I'm going to do to try not to do it again, and would you give me another crack at it?

1203
01:50:17,284 --> 01:50:19,440
That's the proper repentance, right?

1204
01:50:19,581 --> 01:50:26,419
And then you forgive, because you're an idiot too, and you'll probably do something stupid, and maybe you'd like the same kind of break at some point.

1205
01:50:27,502 --> 01:50:32,480
And besides, if we all held each other completely to account at all possible times for everything,

1206
01:50:32,621 --> 01:50:35,640
then it'd just be hopeless, because there'd be no room for error.

1207
01:50:36,826 --> 01:50:41,780
So, The forgiveness which joseph is showing is wise forgiveness

1208
01:50:41,921 --> 01:50:47,540
He's not going to put himself out on the line For people who haven't learned so that the same stupid thing can happen again

1209
01:50:47,681 --> 01:50:52,420
So that they can continue to spread misery wherever they go he's going to find out if they've clued in a little bit

1210
01:50:53,083 --> 01:50:56,300
And then if so, then they can move on with putting a family together

1211
01:50:57,964 --> 01:50:59,073
And so that breaks them up.

1212
01:50:59,073 --> 01:51:06,220
He says joseph could not Refrain himself before all of them that stood by him and he cried and then he said

1213
01:51:07,143 --> 01:51:16,700
get every man away from me so all the people except for Joseph's brother left and there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known unto his

1214
01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:28,495
brothers and Joseph said I'm Joseph is my father still alive and his brothers could not answer for they were troubled at his presence it's like yeah

1215
01:51:32,891 --> 01:51:40,870
understatement of the decade there mm-hmm when Joseph said unto his brothers come near to me I pray you and they came near and he said I am Joseph

1216
01:51:40,930 --> 01:51:48,950
your brother who you sold into Egypt but don't be grieved or angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve

1217
01:51:49,130 --> 01:51:58,778
so now it was not you that sent me here but God and he's made me a father to Pharaoh and Lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt

1218
01:51:59,943 --> 01:52:07,304
hurry and go to my father and say unto him thus say thy son Joseph God has made me, Lord of all Egypt.

1219
01:52:07,304 --> 01:52:13,840
Come down unto me, and tarry not, and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen,

1220
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:18,860
and thou shalt be near unto me, thou and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast.

1221
01:52:18,860 --> 01:52:26,700
And there I will nourish you, for yet there are five years of famine, lest thou and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty."

1222
01:52:27,762 --> 01:52:31,018
So that's the other thing that's another bit of a hint.

1223
01:52:31,018 --> 01:52:33,142
It's a bread hint here.

1224
01:52:37,011 --> 01:52:40,545
Who's the, what's the most reliable source of bread?

1225
01:52:40,545 --> 01:52:46,430
Well, it isn't bread itself It's whatever it is that gives rise to bread, and that's what Joseph is in this story

1226
01:52:46,872 --> 01:52:50,609
He's the force that gives rise to nourishment.

1227
01:52:50,609 --> 01:52:56,790
That's an Joseph is often considered a type of Christ which means like a precursor in some sense

1228
01:52:56,971 --> 01:53:00,004
That's that's one way of thinking about it, and you can see that echoed right there.

1229
01:53:00,004 --> 01:53:03,244
It's like well What do you store up?

1230
01:53:04,194 --> 01:53:05,910
For famine you store up character

1231
01:53:07,314 --> 01:53:08,546
That's the best way through

1232
01:53:10,374 --> 01:53:12,330
Now that doesn't mean you don't also store up bread

1233
01:53:15,253 --> 01:53:19,880
And they went out of Egypt and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob and told him Joseph is still alive

1234
01:53:20,101 --> 01:53:23,080
And he's governor and Jacob's heart fainted for he didn't believe them

1235
01:53:23,642 --> 01:53:33,897
They told him all the words of Joseph which he said to them and when he saw all the wagons which Joseph had sent to Carry him the spirit of Jacob their father revived and Israel said it is enough Joseph.

1236
01:53:33,897 --> 01:53:36,720
My son is yet alive I will go and see him before I die and

1237
01:53:37,181 --> 01:53:46,740
Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac and God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night and said Jacob and

1238
01:53:47,643 --> 01:53:59,280
He said here am I he said I am God the God of thy father don't fear to go to Egypt down into Egypt for I will make you a great nation there, and so that's how the Israelites end up in Egypt

1239
01:54:00,044 --> 01:54:03,420
I will go down with thee into Egypt, and I will also surely bring thee up again.

1240
01:54:04,165 --> 01:54:06,580
And Jacob shall put his hand upon thy eyes, thine eyes.

1241
01:54:07,021 --> 01:54:14,177
And Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob, their father, and the little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

1242
01:54:14,901 --> 01:54:20,436
So the family's now all united in the proper state of being that Joseph has arranged.

1243
01:54:20,436 --> 01:54:21,740
And they took their cattle and their goods.

1244
01:54:22,902 --> 01:54:33,680
It's so interesting too, because of course Joseph isn't even, he's a foreigner as well as being a former slave and prisoner, foreigner, slave and prisoner, and yet he ends up ruling Egypt

1245
01:54:34,663 --> 01:54:39,520
sheerly because of the force of his character and competence, and that's really something to think about.

1246
01:54:41,682 --> 01:54:49,680
And they took their cattle, because that story there is that there isn't anything stronger than that, doesn't matter what the circumstances are, that there isn't a force that's more powerful than that.

1247
01:54:52,665 --> 01:54:57,973
And I don't think that that's In fact, I think it's the exact opposite of naive.

1248
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:03,002
No matter where you are, you can generally make things better, if that's what you want to do.

1249
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:13,051
Unless you're in a place that's really hell itself, that usually is something that elevates you and elevates the people around you.

1250
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:15,631
And you can do that wherever you are.

1251
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:19,118
Because there isn't a place that's so small that you can't do that.

1252
01:55:19,340 --> 01:55:20,450
That's the message of the prison.

1253
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:24,279
And they took their cattle and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan,

1254
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:28,005
and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his seed with him.

1255
01:55:31,010 --> 01:55:34,170
And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen.

1256
01:55:34,210 --> 01:55:36,249
And they came unto the land of Goshen.

1257
01:55:36,350 --> 01:55:44,067
And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went to meet Israel his father, and presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

1258
01:55:44,750 --> 01:55:50,131
And Israel said, I can now die, because I have seen your face, because you are still alive.

1259
01:55:54,180 --> 01:55:59,680
Pharaoh spake unto Joseph saying thy father and thy brethren are coming to thee and the land of Egypt is before thee and the

1260
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:03,900
best of the land your father and brothers can dwell in the land of Goshen let them dwell and

1261
01:56:04,562 --> 01:56:09,640
If they now know any men of activity among them then make them rulers over my cattle gives them a job

1262
01:56:10,262 --> 01:56:14,960
And Joseph brought in Jacob his father and set him before Pharaoh and Jacob blessed Pharaoh

1263
01:56:16,282 --> 01:56:20,440
That's a very interesting little turn of events because you'd expect the opposite under those circumstances

1264
01:56:24,244 --> 01:56:27,880
It appears that Jacob was a man of relatively great self-possession

1265
01:56:28,802 --> 01:56:29,948
Because that's not it.

1266
01:56:29,948 --> 01:56:35,806
You wouldn't bless Queen Elizabeth in all likelihood Unless you had a lot of gall.

1267
01:56:35,806 --> 01:56:37,853
And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, how old are you?

1268
01:56:37,853 --> 01:56:43,520
And Jacob said, I'm a hundred and thirty years Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life

1269
01:56:43,961 --> 01:56:49,440
And I've not attained unto the days of the years of my of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage

1270
01:56:49,901 --> 01:56:53,071
Jacob blessed the Pharaoh and went out from before Pharaoh.

1271
01:56:53,071 --> 01:56:59,150
And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen, and grew and multiplied exceedingly.

1272
01:56:59,150 --> 01:57:01,440
And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years.

1273
01:57:02,683 --> 01:57:05,259
So the whole age of Jacob was a hundred and forty-seven years.

1274
01:57:06,722 --> 01:57:08,952
And the time drew nigh that Israel must die.

1275
01:57:08,952 --> 01:57:14,120
And he called his son Joseph and said unto him, If I have now found grace in thy sight,

1276
01:57:14,662 --> 01:57:19,255
Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me.

1277
01:57:19,255 --> 01:57:21,000
Bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt.

1278
01:57:22,121 --> 01:57:27,419
But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place."

1279
01:57:28,981 --> 01:57:30,920
And Joseph said, I will do as you have said.

1280
01:57:32,085 --> 01:57:35,760
And it came to pass, after these things, that one told Joseph,

1281
01:57:36,161 --> 01:57:40,455
Behold, thy father is sick, and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.

1282
01:57:40,455 --> 01:57:47,440
And one told Jacob, and said, behold thy son and one told Jacob and said behold thy son Joseph cometh unto thee and

1283
01:57:47,942 --> 01:57:57,860
Israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed and Israel said unto Joseph I'd not thought to see your face and lo God hath also showed me your children and

1284
01:57:59,122 --> 01:58:03,120
Joseph brought them out from between his knees and out himself with his face to the earth and

1285
01:58:03,521 --> 01:58:10,571
Joseph took them both Ephraim in his right hand towards Israel's left hand and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand and brought them near unto him and

1286
01:58:11,581 --> 01:58:19,316
Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands purposefully.

1287
01:58:20,001 --> 01:58:25,680
For Manasseh was the firstborn, and when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him.

1288
01:58:26,122 --> 01:58:30,120
And he held up his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.

1289
01:58:31,425 --> 01:58:33,160
And Joseph said unto his father,

1290
01:58:33,321 --> 01:58:37,377
Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn, put the right hand upon his head.

1291
01:58:38,564 --> 01:58:40,658
And his father refused and said I know it my son.

1292
01:58:40,658 --> 01:58:44,540
I know it He shall also become a people and he shall also be great

1293
01:58:44,620 --> 01:58:50,260
But truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of nations another

1294
01:58:51,002 --> 01:58:58,740
Repeat of the same thing that happens continually It says when when God wants to intervene in human affairs what he does is invert tradition

1295
01:58:58,801 --> 01:59:07,100
It's something like that And so that's a sign that that there's something new and special going on and that gives precedence to the younger child rather than the older

1296
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:10,819
child, precedence to what is new rather than what's traditional.

1297
01:59:10,819 --> 01:59:18,977
Of course, sometimes that's necessary because tradition is insufficient and sometimes something new has to come into being in order to update it.

1298
01:59:18,977 --> 01:59:26,694
And Jacob called together his sons and said, gather together so that I can tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.

1299
01:59:26,694 --> 01:59:31,695
Gather yourself together and hear ye sons of Jacob and hearken unto Israel your father.

1300
01:59:31,695 --> 01:59:41,654
Reuben, I'm not going to go through all 12 of these, Reuben thou art my firstborn my might and the beginning my strength, the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power."

1301
01:59:41,654 --> 01:59:52,187
Now the story is quite interesting here because Jacob blesses Joseph's sons before he blesses his own sons.

1302
01:59:52,187 --> 01:59:59,993
And so what he's doing is placing the rights of the firstborn into the sons of his favorite son.

1303
01:59:59,993 --> 02:00:01,759
And then he goes to his sons.

1304
02:00:01,759 --> 02:00:10,726
And so that has implications for the way the biblical stories lay themselves out from thence forward.

1305
02:00:10,726 --> 02:00:12,810
The Excellency of Dignity and the Excellency of Power.

1306
02:00:13,071 --> 02:00:18,918
Unstable is water, thou shalt not excel, because thou wentest up to thy father's bed, then defiled it.

1307
02:00:18,918 --> 02:00:20,143
He went up to my couch.

1308
02:00:20,143 --> 02:00:26,577
You may remember that Reuben slept with his father's concubine.

1309
02:00:26,577 --> 02:00:31,371
Simeon and Levi, our brethren, instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.

1310
02:00:31,371 --> 02:00:45,619
So that painting there, What happened with Simeon and Levi was that somebody lay with their sister, Dinah, and then offered to marry her, and then had

1311
02:00:46,541 --> 02:00:55,679
and then became circumcised because that was part of the deal, and then held all their men circumcised, and then Simeon and Levi went in when they were recovering and killed them all, and then

1312
02:00:56,981 --> 02:01:09,910
Jacob and all his people had to leave because, well, that irritated their relatives, so See me Simeon and Levi are brethren instruments of cruelty are in their habitations

1313
02:01:10,412 --> 02:01:15,070
Oh my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assembly mine honor be not thou united

1314
02:01:15,892 --> 02:01:23,270
For in their anger they slew a man and in their self self will they dig down a wall Cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel

1315
02:01:23,794 --> 02:01:26,070
I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel

1316
02:01:27,611 --> 02:01:35,615
Judah thou art he whom my brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down down before thee.

1317
02:01:35,615 --> 02:01:37,842
Judah is a lion's whelp.

1318
02:01:37,842 --> 02:01:45,388
From the prey, my son, though art gone up, he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion, who shall rouse him up.

1319
02:01:45,388 --> 02:01:56,436
The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come, and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.

1320
02:01:56,436 --> 02:02:01,972
Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well, whose branches run over the wall.

1321
02:02:01,972 --> 02:02:11,889
The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him and hated him, but his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob.

1322
02:02:11,889 --> 02:02:14,420
For thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel.

1323
02:02:17,481 --> 02:02:22,640
Even by the God of thy father who shall help thee, and by the almighty who shall bless thee with the blessings of heavens above,

1324
02:02:22,941 --> 02:02:27,040
blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the beasts, breasts, and of the womb.

1325
02:02:28,002 --> 02:02:33,760
The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills.

1326
02:02:34,342 --> 02:02:39,180
They shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.

1327
02:02:40,705 --> 02:02:42,240
All these are the twelve tribes of Israel.

1328
02:02:43,723 --> 02:02:46,249
And this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them.

1329
02:02:46,249 --> 02:02:49,257
Everyone according to his blessing, he blessed them."

1330
02:02:49,257 --> 02:03:03,580
So that what we see here is an echo in some sense of what happens in the Mesopotamian creation story when, in the Mesopotamian creation story, there's the dragon of Chaos, Tiamat, and her consort.

1331
02:03:06,007 --> 02:03:15,900
Apsu Freshwater and saltwater respectively and they're mingled together and and that combination of Chaos and order gives rise to the first

1332
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:23,360
Assembly of the ancient gods and then the ancient gods kill Apsu casually and foolishly and

1333
02:03:24,301 --> 02:03:29,380
Enraged Tiamat with their foolishness and ignorance and she comes back with a vengeance

1334
02:03:32,163 --> 02:03:40,759
In the meantime, and then she produces this huge army of monsters and puts Kingu, the worst of the monsters, at its head And then decides she's going to take out her creation.

1335
02:03:40,759 --> 02:03:48,837
And so that's a little warning from 3,000 years ago about foolishly undermining your tradition so

1336
02:03:50,291 --> 02:03:54,605
Anyways, the gods in their frenzy go out and try to fight against Tiamatin.

1337
02:03:54,605 --> 02:04:00,970
They come back with their tails between their legs continually but then a new God appears on the scene and that's Marduk he's got

1338
02:04:01,131 --> 02:04:12,050
eyes all the way around his head and he can speak words of magic and they know that there's something new about this newest God it's his capacity for vision

1339
02:04:12,130 --> 02:04:20,930
and his capacity for articulate speech and so they say well why don't you go out and try to deal with the chaos and Marduk says yeah okay no problem but

1340
02:04:21,010 --> 02:04:30,763
here's the deal you elect me top God and now I determine the destiny of the world And so they're desperate because like Tiamat is coming to get them.

1341
02:04:30,763 --> 02:04:38,683
That's chaos with the worst of all possible monsters they're probably thinking he's not going to win anyways and so they agree and out he goes and he

1342
02:04:39,431 --> 02:04:42,890
Confronts Tiamat who's the goddess of Chaos he cuts her into pieces

1343
02:04:43,871 --> 02:04:53,830
And he makes the world out of her pieces and one of his names is he who makes ingenious things out of the combat with Tiamat which is so interesting that's such a remarkable

1344
02:04:53,870 --> 02:04:57,663
That's a remarkable bit of nomenclature.

1345
02:04:57,663 --> 02:04:59,710
So, who should be at the pinnacle?

1346
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:05,290
The force that sees and speaks and goes out to confront Chaos, voluntarily.

1347
02:05:06,293 --> 02:05:08,650
You know how many years it took people to figure that out?

1348
02:05:09,632 --> 02:05:12,703
That's like the pinnacle discovery of humanity.

1349
02:05:12,703 --> 02:05:13,767
That's what that is.

1350
02:05:13,767 --> 02:05:14,470
It's echoed here.

1351
02:05:15,153 --> 02:05:17,630
You know, you see Simeon and Levi, they're too angry.

1352
02:05:18,552 --> 02:05:25,160
The other brothers, they all have flaws and faults of various sorts, and so they're not elevated to the highest place.

1353
02:05:25,160 --> 02:05:27,470
But Joseph, because he has his coat of many colors,

1354
02:05:27,611 --> 02:05:36,790
and because he lands on his feet no matter where he goes, and because he's not resentful and bitter and malevolent and genocidal, and he's not shaking

1355
02:05:36,890 --> 02:05:48,549
his fist at the sky or yelling at God because of Trump, let's say, then he's the he's the right, he's the right representative of the 12 tribes.

1356
02:05:48,549 --> 02:05:50,204
And so That's brilliant.

1357
02:05:50,204 --> 02:05:50,830
It's a brilliant story.

1358
02:05:53,555 --> 02:05:57,866
All these are the 12 tribes of Israel, and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them.

1359
02:05:57,866 --> 02:05:59,937
Everyone according to his blessing, he blessed them.

1360
02:06:01,794 --> 02:06:03,930
When Jacob had made an end of commanding his son,

1361
02:06:04,151 --> 02:06:15,884
so it's the last thing he does to state, he knows that these are the 12 tribes that will progress into the future of this people, and now he's trying it.

1362
02:06:15,884 --> 02:06:25,621
The last thing he does is to try to to hierarchically organize their relative virtues as an indication of what has been learned.

1363
02:06:25,621 --> 02:06:31,190
And when Jacob has made an end of commanding his sons he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost and was gathered

1364
02:06:31,250 --> 02:06:35,090
unto his people and Joseph fell upon his father's face and wept upon him and

1365
02:06:35,190 --> 02:06:43,586
kissed him and Joseph commanded his servants to the physicians to embalm his father and the physicians embalmed Israel.

1366
02:06:43,586 --> 02:06:50,010
When the days of his morning were passed joseph spake into the house of pharaoh saying if now i have found grace in your eyes

1367
02:06:50,710 --> 02:07:01,690
speak i pray you in the ears of pharaoh saying my father made me swear saying lo i die in my grave which i have digged for me in the land of canan there shalt thou bury me now therefore let me go

1368
02:07:01,871 --> 02:07:12,490
up i pray thee and bury my father and i will come again and pharaoh said go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear for his sons carried him into the land of canan and buried

1369
02:07:12,610 --> 02:07:21,723
him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of the burying place of Ephron the Hittite before Mamre.

1370
02:07:21,723 --> 02:07:32,660
And Joseph returned unto Egypt, he and his brethren, and all that went up to him, and all that went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his father.

1371
02:07:32,660 --> 02:07:35,652
And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said

1372
02:07:38,031 --> 02:07:44,170
Joseph will now hate us and will certainly pay back to us all the evil which we did unto him

1373
02:07:45,372 --> 02:07:49,330
and they sent a messenger saying my father did command before he died saying

1374
02:07:50,231 --> 02:07:56,550
For shall ye say unto Joseph forgive I pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren and their sin pretty snivelly really

1375
02:07:57,271 --> 02:08:02,710
For they did unto the evil and now we pray thee forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father

1376
02:08:02,931 --> 02:08:14,050
And Joseph wept when they spake unto him and his brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we be thy servants and Joseph said unto them fear not

1377
02:08:15,392 --> 02:08:19,270
For am I in the place of God but as for you you thought evil against me

1378
02:08:19,732 --> 02:08:25,050
But God meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive

1379
02:08:29,095 --> 02:08:40,910
Now therefore fear you not I will nourish you and your little ones any comfort of them and spake kindly unto them.

1380
02:08:41,150 --> 02:08:51,065
And the idea there is that there is no evil so evil that good cannot triumph over it.

1381
02:08:54,351 --> 02:08:57,486
And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father's house, and Joseph lived 110 years.

1382
02:08:58,330 --> 02:09:05,924
And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation, the children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were brought up upon Joseph's knees.

1383
02:09:07,471 --> 02:09:16,210
And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die, and God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land where he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and Jacob.

1384
02:09:17,714 --> 02:09:27,849
Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and you shall carry my bones from hence So Joseph died being a hundred and ten years old and they embalmed him

1385
02:09:29,235 --> 02:09:32,210
And he was put into a coffin in Egypt

1386
02:09:33,519 --> 02:09:34,707
And that's Genesis

1387
02:09:37,311 --> 02:09:54,920
So thank you all for persevering

1388
02:09:55,160 --> 02:10:25,940
Thank you, thank you

1389
02:10:26,602 --> 02:10:33,300
Well this has been very worthwhile as far as I'm concerned an awful lot and so and I'm very much looking forward to continuing with it

1390
02:10:33,400 --> 02:10:42,660
and thank you all very much for your support and your rapt attention and your seriousness in this endeavor and your care and all of that it's really been a

1391
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:53,560
privilege to be able to do this it's a completely surreal thing to manage and so far you know I think about five million people have watched it so that

1392
02:10:53,580 --> 02:10:56,917
So that seems to be a very good thing, so yeah.

1393
02:11:06,452 --> 02:11:17,159
Okay, so I'm going to ask the questioners, if you've asked a question in the last three sessions, please don't ask a question today, because I never get through everyone,

1394
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:24,019
and so I'd like to have some questions from people that I haven't answered questions from before, if that's okay.

1395
02:11:26,005 --> 02:11:30,420
Hi Professor Peterson, just a two second thank you very much from my community and the Jewish community.

1396
02:11:31,062 --> 02:11:36,738
So many people have been inspired by you to be better people, and I wouldn't be able to speak to you without saying that, so thank you very much.

1397
02:11:38,946 --> 02:11:39,769
A couple of things.

1398
02:11:39,769 --> 02:11:42,400
The first thing I wanted to do is make a quick comment that you might find interesting.

1399
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:51,380
In the Jewish astrological calendar, we read the yearly cycle of the five books of Moses, and it just so happens that we are reading this part of the Torah story.

1400
02:11:51,641 --> 02:12:00,960
story oh that's cool and synchronistic yeah which brings me into a question I wanted to ask you about which is one question with two parts about your

1401
02:12:01,040 --> 02:12:10,139
knowledge of Hebrew because if you look at the Torah scrolls that you find in the synagogue there are no vowels there are no sentences there it is it is

1402
02:12:11,003 --> 02:12:18,239
chaos chaos and order is trying to be bought into it I'm wondering how knowledgeable knowledgeable are you of the Hebrew which has many layers of

1403
02:12:19,287 --> 02:12:21,040
I'm staggeringly ignorant of it

1404
02:12:22,563 --> 02:12:25,500
So you know I read a lot of commentaries, right?

1405
02:12:25,661 --> 02:12:30,960
I'm trying to zero in on the like with each of the phrases that we went through today

1406
02:12:31,221 --> 02:12:40,160
I probably looked at ten different commentaries and so and then I have this underlying psychoanalytic knowledge that it's sort of like

1407
02:12:41,583 --> 02:12:44,779
if you have a bunch of different templates to look at things through and

1408
02:12:45,683 --> 02:12:50,139
And then something shines through all those templates at the same time, that's very unlikely.

1409
02:12:50,700 --> 02:12:59,350
So then you can, you know, a coincidence is one thing, but five coincidences, that's no longer a coincidence, that's something else.

1410
02:12:59,992 --> 02:13:05,129
And so I think, I'm hoping that despite the fact that there's many, many things that I don't know,

1411
02:13:05,610 --> 02:13:12,209
that there's enough things that I do know to kind of weave my way through this with some degree of utility, if not certainty.

1412
02:13:13,171 --> 02:13:21,250
Yeah, because I just, which is the second part, which I guess maybe you don't know, but the midrashic, the Jewish oral stories that date back almost as long as these stories,

1413
02:13:21,274 --> 02:13:28,574
which fill in a lot of mind-blowingly crazy random, so many details about these stories, and I was just wondering if you had encountered any of them before.

1414
02:13:28,670 --> 02:13:38,049
I've encountered some of them, but again, it's, well as you know, it's a very, very rich tradition, and so I haven't encountered enough of it.

1415
02:13:39,091 --> 02:13:44,287
Were you thinking of anything in specific specifically in relationship to this story not in particular?

1416
02:13:44,287 --> 02:13:45,110
I actually forgot it

1417
02:13:45,190 --> 02:13:48,563
I was I was intending to bring you a a book of midrash.

1418
02:13:48,563 --> 02:13:50,430
It's still that's a hell of a thing to say now

1419
02:13:53,093 --> 02:13:55,630
Well, it's just I don't know I had I felt like I had to say that

1420
02:13:56,871 --> 02:13:58,715
But yeah, maybe for the exodus version.

1421
02:13:58,715 --> 02:14:00,019
I'll bring you the alright alright.

1422
02:14:00,019 --> 02:14:01,041
That would be good.

1423
02:14:01,041 --> 02:14:04,790
Yeah, okay, hi dr. Peterson

1424
02:14:05,211 --> 02:14:12,170
I would just like to ask you to please talk about what Jung called a psychic death also known as an ego death

1425
02:14:13,271 --> 02:14:14,896
Okay, sorry say that again.

1426
02:14:14,896 --> 02:14:20,170
Would you please talk about what Jung referred to as a psychic death also called an ego death?

1427
02:14:22,735 --> 02:14:25,020
That's what happens when someone who loves you betrays you

1428
02:14:26,962 --> 02:14:35,000
Right so imagine that like the world is complicated beyond comprehension right when you only see a very little bit of it and

1429
02:14:36,023 --> 02:14:41,100
The way you structure your understanding is you make assumptions about things and they're simplifying assumptions

1430
02:14:41,180 --> 02:14:46,746
So if you trust someone you reduce their complexity Massively, right?

1431
02:14:46,746 --> 02:14:48,860
Because like let's say we were married

1432
02:14:49,922 --> 02:14:53,580
Then there's a whole bunch of ways that you're going to act that are going to be simpler

1433
02:14:55,022 --> 02:14:58,560
Okay, so then I can tolerate being around you in some sense because you're not

1434
02:14:59,461 --> 02:15:11,190
Everything at once now those simplifying structures are hierarchically assembled and Some of them are far more important than others

1435
02:15:12,232 --> 02:15:15,030
Trust is one of them especially trust in loved ones family members

1436
02:15:15,110 --> 02:15:18,810
Which is why betrayal by a family member is really catastrophic because it it on

1437
02:15:19,812 --> 02:15:25,230
It destabilizes your past right all the memories you have it destabilizes your present it destabilizes your future

1438
02:15:25,713 --> 02:15:28,810
it shakes your faith in human beings including yourself and

1439
02:15:29,691 --> 02:15:32,189
everything collapses and that's an ego death and

1440
02:15:34,592 --> 02:15:39,590
Now underneath the ego as far as Jung was concerned was another structure that he called the self and

1441
02:15:40,313 --> 02:15:43,530
The self is the thing that remains constant across ego deaths

1442
02:15:44,994 --> 02:15:50,549
but it's it's deeper and less personal its archetypal and

1443
02:15:51,732 --> 02:15:56,690
It's the thing that the ego collapses into when it collapses and then that rebuilds the ego

1444
02:15:57,411 --> 02:16:01,470
Something like that across time, but that's what an ego death is now

1445
02:16:02,213 --> 02:16:07,315
there's variants of that because you can have a voluntary or an involuntary ego death.

1446
02:16:07,315 --> 02:16:11,334
And a voluntary ego death is when you learn a bunch and you're willing to let go.

1447
02:16:11,334 --> 02:16:13,966
So that would be your own immolation.

1448
02:16:13,966 --> 02:16:18,086
It's like you're lighting your you're a phoenix and you're lighting yourself on fire.

1449
02:16:18,086 --> 02:16:22,283
That's a much better idea even though it can still be really harsh.

1450
02:16:22,283 --> 02:16:25,116
The involuntary ego deaths, they're really hard on people.

1451
02:16:25,116 --> 02:16:36,069
People will do almost anything to stop that from happening, which is partly why they fight to maintain their group-fostered axiomatic simplifications.

1452
02:16:36,572 --> 02:16:46,820
It's not surprising, because it's very… you lose your… like that ego death is a journey into the underworld, or it's a collapse into chaos, and that's not so bad if you do it purposefully.

1453
02:16:47,710 --> 02:16:53,387
But in the Pinocchio story, for example, that's exemplified by Pinocchio going down to the depths to rescue his father from the whale.

1454
02:16:53,790 --> 02:16:56,324
Now he does that voluntarily, but it damn near kills him, right?

1455
02:16:57,350 --> 02:16:59,699
of all, he hardly gets out of the whale.

1456
02:16:59,699 --> 02:17:04,094
Second, he actually drowns and dies, but he comes back to life.

1457
02:17:04,094 --> 02:17:12,127
So even if you do it voluntarily, it's still... it's just better than doing it involuntarily, which is the other alternative.

1458
02:17:12,127 --> 02:17:12,970
So that's what it is.

1459
02:17:12,970 --> 02:17:21,723
You bet.

1460
02:17:21,723 --> 02:17:23,826
Hello Dr. Beutissen.

1461
02:17:23,826 --> 02:17:30,350
So I've been listening back to all of these biblical lectures for the second time now, and I wanted to show you an

1462
02:17:30,511 --> 02:17:37,510
observation I came upon because I was trying to find a question that you haven't been asked before which is harder than doing my Ryerson exams

1463
02:17:37,651 --> 02:17:48,350
that's for sure so so I've noticed I think you're getting funnier oh yes oh no I think Michael Coren said that this week I

1464
02:17:48,390 --> 02:17:58,190
think but the word he used was bizarre I think actually I'm feeling better so that's I actually have a sense of humor it's it's hard to believe that but so it

1465
02:17:58,391 --> 02:18:06,930
sort of comes back when I'm not feeling like I'm going to die at any moment so yeah I've basically noticed one you're making more attempts at jokes so that's

1466
02:18:07,030 --> 02:18:24,830
great thank you thank you to those jokes are landing more often but then there's this third element which I think was what Steve Martin quit because of which

1467
02:18:25,011 --> 02:18:31,610
is that I think the audience is anticipating jokes more and they're actually you know I've noticed people laughing more at things that aren't

1468
02:18:31,771 --> 02:18:37,115
intending to be jokes, so I was just wondering what you make of that and They're intended.

1469
02:18:37,115 --> 02:18:38,379
I'm hoping they're intended.

1470
02:18:38,379 --> 02:18:41,750
Just because I keep a straight face doesn't mean they're not intended to be jokes

1471
02:18:42,492 --> 02:18:44,379
So yeah, no, it's good.

1472
02:18:44,379 --> 02:18:47,330
Look one of the things is like it's and I've tried to keep this

1473
02:18:47,952 --> 02:18:52,730
I learned a while ago probably about five years ago that even when you're dealing with really serious matters

1474
02:18:53,352 --> 02:18:57,110
That if you're not handling it with a light touch, you're not an expert at it

1475
02:18:57,170 --> 02:18:58,515
You're not a master at it.

1476
02:18:58,515 --> 02:19:02,889
And you think, well, there are some things that are so deep and dark that you can't handle them with a light touch.

1477
02:19:03,511 --> 02:19:07,001
And that's actually not true.

1478
02:19:07,001 --> 02:19:08,927
That doesn't mean you make light of them.

1479
02:19:08,927 --> 02:19:10,050
It doesn't mean anything like that.

1480
02:19:10,110 --> 02:19:14,347
It's that you don't... It's minimal necessary force.

1481
02:19:14,347 --> 02:19:15,070
It's something like that.

1482
02:19:15,150 --> 02:19:17,679
You don't hit it any harder than you have to.

1483
02:19:17,679 --> 02:19:20,809
And it's an art when you're discussing serious matters.

1484
02:19:21,210 --> 02:19:26,810
So, well, one of the upshots of that is that because we're discussing serious matters,

1485
02:19:26,891 --> 02:19:29,790
and because serious matters are being discussed in the culture at large right now,

1486
02:19:29,850 --> 02:19:32,468
it would be really good if everybody could keep their sense of humor.

1487
02:19:33,252 --> 02:19:41,328
You know, and I see positive signs of that, like there's a lot of satirical activity on the net, you know, and that could easily catalyze into horror mob.

1488
02:19:41,811 --> 02:19:42,796
But it isn't.

1489
02:19:42,796 --> 02:19:45,390
It is, you know, that that's happening to some degree.

1490
02:19:45,470 --> 02:19:50,370
But a lot of it's satire and comedy, and as long as we can keep a sense of humor about this,

1491
02:19:50,491 --> 02:19:52,329
Then I think well

1492
02:19:53,312 --> 02:19:56,210
We're not as close to disaster as we might be and so

1493
02:19:56,651 --> 02:20:03,750
What one of the things that I have found rather ominous is that there are comedians first of all being persecuted for under free speech

1494
02:20:04,810 --> 02:20:12,470
Restriction legislation which I think is absolutely appalling, but also that there are comedians now who won't perform on university campuses John Cleese won't

1495
02:20:15,538 --> 02:20:20,070
Seinfeld that's like well, you know how offensive he is it's no wonder that I mean he's it's like the straightest

1496
02:20:20,830 --> 02:20:25,183
Nicest comedian you could possibly imagine he won't perform on college campuses.

1497
02:20:25,183 --> 02:20:27,770
I think Louis ck won't perform on or anywhere else

1498
02:20:31,031 --> 02:20:42,610
But it's a bad sign, but no humor humor is good, and it's interesting because I've been kind of watching how I'm represented on the web weirdly enough and there's all these memes that have

1499
02:20:42,710 --> 02:20:54,650
emerged I don't know thousands of the bloody things and most of them are comical and that's good like people are there whatever it is that they're doing

1500
02:20:54,710 --> 02:20:57,890
I don't know what the hell it is but it's being done with a relatively light

1501
02:20:58,071 --> 02:21:07,913
touch and that's really really good that's how it should be you got to have a sense of humor I mean it's one of the things that makes life bearable so or maybe even better than bearable.

1502
02:21:07,913 --> 02:21:09,855
So you bet.

1503
02:21:09,855 --> 02:21:17,707
Hello Dr. Peterson.

1504
02:21:17,707 --> 02:21:27,515
Just want to say what a great lecture series and this is the last in this year so Merry Christmas to you and your family.

1505
02:21:27,515 --> 02:21:27,997
Thank you.

1506
02:21:27,997 --> 02:21:28,379
Thank you.

1507
02:21:28,379 --> 02:21:31,249
I just want to say this...

1508
02:21:31,871 --> 02:21:36,345
Don't get too enthusiastic about that.

1509
02:21:36,345 --> 02:21:38,070
I wrote you an essay of a question and

1510
02:21:38,291 --> 02:21:46,650
And then I used the lecture or the essay writing guide on Psych 230 to narrow it down to just a few pages, a few lines.

1511
02:21:46,670 --> 02:21:52,029
And then during this particular lecture, the zigzag slide manifests again.

1512
02:21:52,110 --> 02:21:57,009
And I thought, ah, I basically just had all my questions answered.

1513
02:21:57,110 --> 02:22:10,870
So basically, I just want to ask the idea of you've made a lecture that was on YouTube many years ago.

1514
02:22:10,970 --> 02:22:17,809
And you keep referring to Cain and Abel and the death of Abel by Cain and the curse.

1515
02:22:18,130 --> 02:22:23,965
And I think, well, that was a single, two brothers conflicting.

1516
02:22:25,193 --> 02:22:33,909
But here we have in the sons of Jacob, the 12, there was one who was good, one who was an Abel archetype.

1517
02:22:34,410 --> 02:22:36,546
And there were 11 that came after him.

1518
02:22:37,250 --> 02:22:41,864
So, that, I don't know, maybe there's something about the division, or, uh...

1519
02:22:44,113 --> 02:22:45,361
No, that's a good observation.

1520
02:22:45,361 --> 02:22:46,428
I hadn't thought about that.

1521
02:22:47,011 --> 02:22:47,754
Yeah.

1522
02:22:47,754 --> 02:22:52,610
Well, I mean, there's a bit of variability, because Ruben, and Ruben isn't quite as bad as the rest.

1523
02:22:52,670 --> 02:22:56,288
But yeah, I would say it's probably easier for the Kain side to multiply.

1524
02:22:57,395 --> 02:22:58,643
Luckily, it's not as powerful.

1525
02:23:00,254 --> 02:23:01,724
Because it doesn't do anything, like, it...

1526
02:23:04,734 --> 02:23:06,979
Yes, yes, and, you know, there's...

1527
02:23:07,904 --> 02:23:11,857
Jung was often included accused of Manichaeanism

1528
02:23:12,941 --> 02:23:22,400
I'm not pronouncing that properly, but there was a there was a variant of Christian dogma that held that good and evil were separate metaphysical realities and that they were battling for the

1529
02:23:23,141 --> 02:23:30,220
For governance of the cosmos something like that, but they both had an independent existence and the classical Christian idea

1530
02:23:30,381 --> 02:23:33,240
Which won out over that was that no that good was real

1531
02:23:33,421 --> 02:23:38,660
but evil was the absence of good now that produced all sorts of the absence of good produces all sorts of

1532
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:43,899
Consequences and it is interesting to read young because he does get kind of Manichaean in his

1533
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:49,700
discussions and I think it was partly because he was so concerned about what happened in Nazi Germany and then with

1534
02:23:50,422 --> 02:23:57,640
Cold war afterwards you know because evil seemed to be a palpable force, but I Don't think that it's as powerful as good

1535
02:23:57,640 --> 02:24:03,734
And but I do think it's easier for it to multiply because it's Well, it's easier path

1536
02:24:04,802 --> 02:24:09,840
It's easy to be resentful and hostile and bitter and and do nothing that's easy

1537
02:24:10,704 --> 02:24:12,320
It's horrible, and it's hard on people

1538
02:24:12,400 --> 02:24:19,060
But it doesn't require a tremendous amount of faith or effort so maybe that is why it's multiplied in the final story in Genesis

1539
02:24:19,942 --> 02:24:27,500
Yeah, and I've been reading ahead and for my own based on the interest of of the present presented stories.

1540
02:24:27,580 --> 02:24:34,294
And I keyed in on a few other books and chapters in the Bible, like 1 Corinthians 13, which is the love chapter.

1541
02:24:35,380 --> 02:24:42,219
And that cycles through the idea of, I can have all things in life, knowledge, power, but it's all passing.

1542
02:24:42,320 --> 02:24:47,839
And now and forever are faith, hope, and love.

1543
02:24:48,181 --> 02:24:50,896
And then, of course, love triumphs overall.

1544
02:24:51,761 --> 02:24:52,718
Yeah, well, the love issue.

1545
02:24:52,980 --> 02:24:59,359
You see, I've thought a lot about the relationship between love and truth, because I've thought and talked a lot more about truth.

1546
02:25:00,061 --> 02:25:04,418
And I think partly that's because love is a word that you can hardly even say, because it's been so...

1547
02:25:05,844 --> 02:25:09,579
It's like it's been dragged behind a car through mud puddles, it's something like that.

1548
02:25:10,422 --> 02:25:17,720
But, sorry, let me just finish elaborating this idea, but I think that the love idea is associated with,

1549
02:25:18,643 --> 02:25:23,200
For me, at least, with what I discussed at the beginning of this lecture with regards to faith,

1550
02:25:23,340 --> 02:25:28,759
I think you have to make a decision about what your attitude towards being is going to be.

1551
02:25:29,702 --> 02:25:34,559
And the proper attitude, in my estimation, is that you're working for its betterment.

1552
02:25:35,522 --> 02:25:45,499
You know, and so maybe you have the same attitude towards being as you do towards someone that you love, like a son, or a daughter, or a wife, that you want things to be better.

1553
02:25:46,322 --> 02:25:47,749
And then so that's your aim.

1554
02:25:47,749 --> 02:25:51,969
So the aim is basically the aim is motivated by love

1555
02:25:53,722 --> 02:25:58,600
You want things to be better because I think that's a good definition of love like if you really care for someone

1556
02:25:59,303 --> 02:26:02,040
You can tell because you want things to be better for them

1557
02:26:02,521 --> 02:26:08,580
And then I think truth is nested inside that because I think that truth is the best servant of love something like that

1558
02:26:14,862 --> 02:26:20,002
So I've been struggling with an idea recently that I was thinking maybe you'd be able to help me out with with.

1559
02:26:20,002 --> 02:26:29,349
Basically in a recent interview you talked about how myth is meant to reconcile inherent contradictions in reality right?

1560
02:26:29,349 --> 02:26:42,493
But I'm sort of stuck between two mythological or psychoanalytic ideas that I think are both really important but they seem to have a inherent contradiction within them that I've been trying to figure out.

1561
02:26:42,493 --> 02:26:48,000
So on one hand you have this idea that there's times in your life where you have to identify things in yourself that

1562
02:26:48,140 --> 02:27:01,646
are insufficient or there's a problem somehow that you have to kind of have a controlled burn or like a phoenix-like transformation where you discard part of yourself that doesn't fit or is not working.

1563
02:27:01,646 --> 02:27:12,640
But then on the other hand you have talked about this Jungian idea where as you become really, when you get older you mature by reincorporating things about

1564
02:27:12,720 --> 02:27:22,120
yourself that you lost when you were younger or that you know you're trying to integrate your shadow or you're trying to find parts of your personality that maybe you've been

1565
02:27:22,241 --> 02:27:26,339
rejecting and try and figure out how to bring them into the fold or into the whole.

1566
02:27:26,339 --> 02:27:31,093
So he's got this quote that I really like which is, I'd rather be whole than good.

1567
02:27:31,093 --> 02:27:37,658
So on one hand you may identify something as a problem and you want to get rid of it or burn it off.

1568
02:27:38,180 --> 02:27:47,516
But then on the other hand it seems like the path to being stronger is to figure out how how to put everything together.

1569
02:27:48,382 --> 02:28:00,637
So there's one of the things Jung wrote about in his works on alchemy was an explanation of the prime alchemical dictum, which was solvae coagula, which meant dissolve and integrate.

1570
02:28:02,644 --> 02:28:04,629
Right, so imagine this.

1571
02:28:04,629 --> 02:28:12,498
Imagine you had a fairly hostile father who was not very well controlled in his aggression.

1572
02:28:13,725 --> 02:28:16,139
Decent person, other than that, but let's say that.

1573
02:28:16,823 --> 02:28:19,359
And so your reaction is, I'm never going to be aggressive.

1574
02:28:20,580 --> 02:28:25,159
And so you've built a moral structure that's part of your personality.

1575
02:28:26,440 --> 02:28:32,159
And there's possibility floating around outside of that, that you've denied an ethical...

1576
02:28:33,161 --> 02:28:35,258
You've denied any ethical...

1577
02:28:36,768 --> 02:28:37,297
What would you say?

1578
02:28:37,922 --> 02:28:41,640
You've stripped the idea of aggression of any ethical utility whatsoever.

1579
02:28:42,523 --> 02:28:43,606
Okay, so what happens?

1580
02:28:43,606 --> 02:28:46,476
This burns off, and then that comes back up.

1581
02:28:46,476 --> 02:28:47,680
Now you still have to integrate it.

1582
02:28:48,161 --> 02:28:53,740
So, it's associated in some sense with Nietzsche's idea of morality as cowardice.

1583
02:28:54,502 --> 02:29:00,539
Because one of Nietzsche's most trenchant critiques of traditional morality, let's say,

1584
02:29:01,081 --> 02:29:04,696
is that most of what passes for morality isn't morality.

1585
02:29:04,696 --> 02:29:05,599
It's just cowardice.

1586
02:29:05,921 --> 02:29:09,214
It's not that I'm a good person and I don't hurt you.

1587
02:29:09,214 --> 02:29:10,559
It's that I'm afraid to hurt you.

1588
02:29:10,901 --> 02:29:14,800
And because I don't want to admit that I'm afraid to hurt you, then I say I'm moral.

1589
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:20,319
Because then I can mask my essential fear and cowardice in a guise of morality.

1590
02:29:20,782 --> 02:29:23,780
And that happens far more often than you would think.

1591
02:29:23,860 --> 02:29:26,619
Because harmless and moral are by no means the same thing.

1592
02:29:27,462 --> 02:29:32,740
So some of what you're burning off, this is where Freud was such a genius, I think.

1593
02:29:33,061 --> 02:29:39,300
Because he concentrated on aggression and sexuality, which are perhaps the two most difficult parts of a personality to integrate.

1594
02:29:39,881 --> 02:29:54,820
said that the hyper-simplified morality stops you from tapping into deeper recesses of your psyche.

1595
02:29:55,685 --> 02:29:57,878
And it's partly because they're primal forces.

1596
02:29:58,583 --> 02:30:01,480
It's not surprising that you don't want to have anything to do with them.

1597
02:30:01,822 --> 02:30:05,040
That you stay away from situations where they might make themselves manifest.

1598
02:30:05,100 --> 02:30:08,819
But the problem is, by denying the worst in yourself in that manner, suppressing it,

1599
02:30:09,322 --> 02:30:12,179
you preclude the possibility of the best.

1600
02:30:12,843 --> 02:30:16,260
Because no one can be a good person without integrating their capacity for aggression.

1601
02:30:17,262 --> 02:30:20,839
Because without that capacity for aggression, you cannot say no.

1602
02:30:22,141 --> 02:30:30,348
Because no means, if you really say it, no means, there isn't anything that you can do to me that will make me change my mind.

1603
02:30:30,348 --> 02:30:34,059
Or conversely, it means I will play for higher stakes than you will.

1604
02:30:36,361 --> 02:30:41,020
Unless you've got your aggression integrated, there isn't a chance you can say that.

1605
02:30:41,100 --> 02:30:45,139
And if you did, no one would take you seriously, because they'd know it was just a show.

1606
02:30:46,140 --> 02:30:52,400
So, one of the most useful things that Jung did, I think, was to work on this idea of the integration of the shadow.

1607
02:30:52,520 --> 02:30:54,846
Because he was really interested in the idea of evil, right?

1608
02:30:54,846 --> 02:31:00,840
Especially working with trying to parcel out what happened in Nazi Germany during the Second World War.

1609
02:31:01,480 --> 02:31:04,935
What do you do with the part of you that's aggressive and potentially malevolent?

1610
02:31:04,935 --> 02:31:05,859
Do you just crush it?

1611
02:31:06,320 --> 02:31:08,230
That's the superego response, in some sense.

1612
02:31:08,230 --> 02:31:10,279
Do you just put it behind you, so to speak?

1613
02:31:11,241 --> 02:31:12,867
Is that a possibility?

1614
02:31:12,867 --> 02:31:15,819
Or do you admit to its existence and bring it into the game?

1615
02:31:16,341 --> 02:31:23,279
And that's... See, for Freud in some sense, morality was superego clamping down on the id.

1616
02:31:24,145 --> 02:31:25,597
And they were fundamentally opposed.

1617
02:31:26,563 --> 02:31:29,460
Both Jung and Piaget had a different idea, and I think they were right.

1618
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:33,699
It's like, no, no, you invite the bad guys out to play.

1619
02:31:34,423 --> 02:31:36,718
And so, you're an aggressive hockey player.

1620
02:31:37,501 --> 02:31:40,430
But, it's disciplined aggression.

1621
02:31:40,430 --> 02:31:43,258
That gives you access to a whole source of energy you wouldn't otherwise have.

1622
02:31:44,522 --> 02:31:50,020
And then with regards to sexuality, it's like, well, untrammeled promiscuity doesn't constitute a virtue.

1623
02:31:50,822 --> 02:31:55,131
But neither does unavoidable virginity, right?

1624
02:31:55,131 --> 02:31:59,000
In fact, I think that's worse, because it also masks itself with virtue.

1625
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:05,659
It's like, well you should be able to, you should be able to do things that you wouldn't do.

1626
02:32:07,243 --> 02:32:11,173
That's like the definition of a genuinely moral person.

1627
02:32:11,173 --> 02:32:13,639
They could do it, but they don't.

1628
02:32:15,083 --> 02:32:16,668
That's not cowardice.

1629
02:32:16,668 --> 02:32:21,020
And so that's, you burn off the things that get in the way of that integration.

1630
02:32:22,081 --> 02:32:37,900
So when you say dissolve and integrate, might it be a good way to sort of bring the two ideas together that the burning off and the difficult process is necessary because the elements of yourself are structured together in a rigid way that is not working properly?

1631
02:32:38,241 --> 02:32:41,390
Yeah, that's what happens to Geppetto in the belly of the whale.

1632
02:32:41,390 --> 02:32:44,980
He's so caught in his presuppositions that he can't escape.

1633
02:32:45,722 --> 02:32:47,706
And so Pinocchio represents the new force.

1634
02:32:47,706 --> 02:32:48,969
So it's very interesting.

1635
02:32:48,969 --> 02:32:53,980
So when you watch Pinocchio try to rescue him, the first thing Geppetto does is confuse Pinocchio with a fish.

1636
02:32:54,020 --> 02:32:56,027
Because he wants something to eat.

1637
02:32:56,027 --> 02:33:00,020
But Pinocchio is better than something to eat because he can rescue him so he doesn't need to eat.

1638
02:33:00,482 --> 02:33:05,020
And then Pinocchio wants to make a fire and Geppetto objects because he's going to burn up all the furniture.

1639
02:33:05,060 --> 02:33:09,020
It's like, we don't need the damn furniture if we're getting out of the whale, you know?

1640
02:33:09,681 --> 02:33:14,733
And so Gepetto, and he's old, so that's the rigid structure.

1641
02:33:14,733 --> 02:33:18,000
That's the old year that has to die off before the new year can be born.

1642
02:33:18,642 --> 02:33:23,020
It's a forest fire that allows for new growth, and that's how those things are put together.

1643
02:33:24,024 --> 02:33:28,020
See, and it's useful to know, too, because if you burn something off, you might think, well, there's nothing left.

1644
02:33:28,281 --> 02:33:30,470
It's like, that's not true.

1645
02:33:30,470 --> 02:33:32,759
If it's deadwood, then you have room for new growth.

1646
02:33:33,421 --> 02:33:37,029
And you want to be doing that on a fairly regular basis.

1647
02:33:37,029 --> 02:33:41,800
That's the snake that sheds its skin and transforms itself, right?

1648
02:33:42,622 --> 02:33:46,294
That's the death and resurrection from a psychological perspective.

1649
02:33:46,294 --> 02:33:47,518
It's exactly the same idea.

1650
02:33:48,020 --> 02:33:50,105
Now we don't know the upper limit to that, right?

1651
02:33:50,105 --> 02:33:54,616
Because we don't know what a person would be like if they let everything that they could let go, let go.

1652
02:33:56,523 --> 02:33:59,980
And only let in what was seemly, let's say.

1653
02:34:01,162 --> 02:34:13,000
But you can see that, it's funny, we don't know that to some degree, you can see people start to do that, that's not a rare experience.

1654
02:34:13,482 --> 02:34:19,020
And people improve very rapidly, they can improve their lives very rapidly, a lot of it's low hanging fruit.

1655
02:34:19,461 --> 02:34:25,000
Like if you just stop doing really stupid things that you know are stupid, your life improves a lot.

1656
02:34:26,283 --> 02:34:28,609
So, and it frees you up.

1657
02:34:28,609 --> 02:34:32,459
It also means, there's an element there that's also associated with pride.

1658
02:34:33,782 --> 02:34:40,920
Because people tend to take pride in who they are, and that's a bad idea, because that stops you from becoming who you could be.

1659
02:34:41,060 --> 02:34:45,096
Because if you're proud of who you are, you won't let that go when it's necessary.

1660
02:34:45,096 --> 02:34:46,020
You won't step away from it.

1661
02:34:46,020 --> 02:34:51,037
You know, and then you end up being your own parody, something like that.

1662
02:34:51,037 --> 02:34:57,580
That's also a very bad idea. idea you want to be continually stepping away from your previous self and so big

1663
02:34:58,162 --> 02:35:06,620
and I guess part of that too is that you you have to decide you know are you are you order are you chaos are you the process that mediates between them and

1664
02:35:06,660 --> 02:35:10,219
if you're the process that mediates between them you you are the thing that

1665
02:35:10,520 --> 02:35:22,444
transforms and that's the right attitude for a human being because that's what we are we're the thing that voluntarily confronts chaos and transforms that's what we are.

1666
02:35:22,444 --> 02:35:29,021
And so for better or worse, you know, that's our deepest biological essence, you might say.

1667
02:35:29,021 --> 02:35:33,127
And so you can let things go if you know that there's more growth to come.

1668
02:35:33,127 --> 02:35:43,220
So, one more.

1669
02:35:44,401 --> 02:35:47,400
Thank you for your time, and thank you for spending your time with all of us.

1670
02:35:47,603 --> 02:35:48,420
Hey, my pleasure.

1671
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:50,246
It's been a pleasure.

1672
02:35:50,246 --> 02:36:03,718
So, if I could, since we are at the end of Genesis, I'd like the opportunity to challenge or at least have you take another look at your position you've held with regards to Cain's reflection on the murder of Abel.

1673
02:36:03,718 --> 02:36:06,977
I bring this up because it's actually a part of Genesis that has bothered me for a while and

1674
02:36:07,480 --> 02:36:13,891
it's not like because it's not as straightforward as it's presented usually and it's very I've been wrestling with it.

1675
02:36:13,891 --> 02:36:20,160
So in this series as well as in a couple of your maps of meaning lectures you summarized it something to the

1676
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:24,300
effect of Cain coming to the conclusion that what he did leads to a punishment

1677
02:36:24,621 --> 02:36:38,073
which is more than he believes he can face, which I believe to be born out of a natural reading of specific translation choices incorrectly made or in sorry innocently made by editors just for readability sake.

1678
02:36:38,073 --> 02:36:44,095
So in Genesis 4 13, Cain does not say my punishment is greater than I can bear.

1679
02:36:44,095 --> 02:36:51,040
He actually says, though I only mean so my sin is greater than I can bear which is to say yeah

1680
02:36:51,683 --> 02:37:00,740
which is to say it's not his past actions which is say it's not his past actions it's his futures consequences which it's his past actions not his

1681
02:37:00,820 --> 02:37:05,420
future consequences which he regrets for him to say I won't iniquity or sin that

1682
02:37:05,581 --> 02:37:12,639
is too much for him to bear as a reflection on the reality of his corruption and not a plea of mercy to the deity to spare him okay well that's

1683
02:37:13,421 --> 02:37:24,035
seems to be a deeper interpretation, I would say. And I think it's more—that's the same line of reasoning that Dostoevsky pursued in Crime and Punishment, right?

1684
02:37:24,035 --> 02:37:29,475
Because in Crime and Punishment Raskolnikov gets away with murder, and then he cannot stand it.

1685
02:37:29,475 --> 02:37:32,728
He cannot stand that he did it, because he's no longer the same person.

1686
02:37:32,728 --> 02:37:35,680
But even more, he cannot stand that he got away with it.

1687
02:37:35,680 --> 02:37:40,175
So that's more in keeping with that interpretation.

1688
02:37:40,175 --> 02:37:45,538
This also is reflected in the following verse in 414 where he states the consequences of his actions,

1689
02:37:45,981 --> 02:37:49,734
mainly that God's presence will be hidden from him and that he will be killed.

1690
02:37:50,221 --> 02:37:53,676
The verse opens with the word hein, which means indeed, more or less,

1691
02:37:54,300 --> 02:37:56,816
and denotes a sense of acceptance and not a complaint.

1692
02:37:57,561 --> 02:38:04,956
It is the difference between saying, oh no, will God now hide his face from me and will I be hunted, versus of course God will hide his face from me

1693
02:38:05,321 --> 02:38:16,079
and I will be hunted and killed, which I've been wrestling with and have taken away to possibly mean that there are sins that we can do that will just push us too far.

1694
02:38:16,602 --> 02:38:18,151
Well, okay, there are, well, okay.

1695
02:38:19,781 --> 02:38:27,640
So, one of the things that you see in post-traumatic stress disorder situations, for example,

1696
02:38:27,720 --> 02:38:33,799
is that people view themselves doing something so terrible, they don't know how to put it right.

1697
02:38:35,386 --> 02:38:43,214
So, you could say under those circumstances, the face of God is hidden from them, Because they cannot atone for it.

1698
02:38:43,214 --> 02:38:50,320
They cannot reconcile themselves to it. It's there all the time. And they can't see anything good beyond it. It's hell, essentially.

1699
02:38:51,002 --> 02:39:01,479
And so, sometimes when you're working with people with post-traumatic stress disorder, you kind of initiate them into a philosophy of good and evil, so that they can see.

1700
02:39:01,982 --> 02:39:06,140
When Joseph talks to his brothers, and they've got all this guilt, right?

1701
02:39:06,762 --> 02:39:12,480
And he doesn't want them to have more guilt than necessary to fix themselves, because it just burdens them otherwise.

1702
02:39:12,540 --> 02:39:17,019
He says, look, don't forget, yeah, yeah, it was you, but it's also God's doing.

1703
02:39:17,900 --> 02:39:23,779
And I had a client once who had obsessive-compulsive disorder, and he was a very smart guy.

1704
02:39:24,181 --> 02:39:30,399
He also happened to work in a lab that had a lot of radioactive materials, which wasn't the best place for someone with OCD.

1705
02:39:31,181 --> 02:39:40,540
And he was worried that he would make some mistake, and this is very common with OCD, that would result in someone's suffering, which you will, you'll do that.

1706
02:39:41,141 --> 02:39:56,640
And it wasn't until I could get him to conceptualize himself and his life, in part as a force of nature, that he was able to reconcile himself to the possibility that an error on his part would produce catastrophic consequences.

1707
02:39:57,262 --> 02:40:02,640
But people often find themselves in situations where they just, they cannot reconcile themselves to what they've done.

1708
02:40:03,041 --> 02:40:12,440
And that, it makes sense to me, that the interpretation that you're describing, that makes plenty of sense from a psychological perspective.

1709
02:40:12,861 --> 02:40:17,479
There are things that will push us just beyond our limits that are too far.

1710
02:40:18,222 --> 02:40:24,379
But there are also no consequences to our actions that are devoid of a truth we can accept and learn from.

1711
02:40:24,962 --> 02:40:28,219
And this is what I've kind of delved out of this bit with Cain and Abel.

1712
02:40:28,661 --> 02:40:38,639
So if this is the case, why then does it take us so long, and with so much self to know, before we accept personal responsibility, when faced with tragedy, especially when it's self-inflicted?

1713
02:40:43,651 --> 02:40:49,129
Well, I don't think you want to underestimate the contribution of just sheer difficulty.

1714
02:40:50,111 --> 02:40:58,410
Like, you know, let's say you're grieving because someone close to you died.

1715
02:40:59,672 --> 02:41:02,024
It's like well, it isn't just that you've lost them although.

1716
02:41:02,024 --> 02:41:02,869
That's a big part of it.

1717
02:41:02,869 --> 02:41:10,610
It's that You have to rebuild yourself, and it's really hard to do that so and it is sort of proportional to the

1718
02:41:11,350 --> 02:41:17,370
Significance of your error so if you commit an error, and then you recognize that it's an error if it's a sort of surface error,

1719
02:41:17,571 --> 02:41:24,347
it's like well, you can just touch up the paint, but sometimes the whole understructure is just rotten and

1720
02:41:27,411 --> 02:41:31,705
You don't know what to do, and then so that's one problem.

1721
02:41:31,705 --> 02:41:34,959
It's just sheer bloody difficulty And I see this with people very often.

1722
02:41:34,959 --> 02:41:39,760
It's like they're at a point in their divorce Let's say, and they don't know what to do.

1723
02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:41,627
They cannot solve the problem.

1724
02:41:41,627 --> 02:41:47,130
It's too complicated They just don't have the resources, and maybe they've squandered some of the resources as well

1725
02:41:47,271 --> 02:41:54,410
But sometimes they just don't have the resources and then if you add to that Error and sin and malevolence and blindness and all those other things people

1726
02:41:55,353 --> 02:42:01,790
There's a guy named Thomas Saz who wrote this really interesting article in the 1960s, a book actually called The Myth of Mental Illness.

1727
02:42:02,673 --> 02:42:07,910
And it was classic reading for clinical psychologists when I was training.

1728
02:42:08,311 --> 02:42:17,730
And the reason for that was that Saz pointed out, and this is true, is that lots of times if you're a psychotherapist, people don't come to you because they have mental illnesses.

1729
02:42:18,432 --> 02:42:22,390
They come to you because they have insoluble problems in their life.

1730
02:42:22,893 --> 02:42:33,950
You know like maybe they've had a two-year affair at work their Wife is alcoholic, and they have a very and their father has Alzheimer's disease

1731
02:42:35,174 --> 02:42:39,002
It's like they just don't know what to do It's too much now.

1732
02:42:39,002 --> 02:42:44,910
You know they shouldn't have had the affair So there's a moral issue, and maybe they should have intervened in the alcoholism in the family

1733
02:42:45,191 --> 02:42:48,544
Maybe they use their wives alcoholism as an excuse to have the affair.

1734
02:42:48,544 --> 02:42:50,090
You know like these things get very tangled

1735
02:42:50,733 --> 02:42:53,830
It's just, it's so bloody complicated that people can't untangle it.

1736
02:42:54,791 --> 02:43:01,430
So, and I would say that's in keeping with the interpretation that you laid forth with regards to Cain, is it sounds like

1737
02:43:02,032 --> 02:43:08,062
it's one of the reasons why it's so useful to read multiple translations, right, because nuances matter.

1738
02:43:09,232 --> 02:43:18,509
It sounds to me from that description that he actually woke up at least briefly and noticed what he did, and and said, there's no coming back from this.

1739
02:43:18,991 --> 02:43:23,830
And it is, you can easily get places that you do not know how to come back from.

1740
02:43:23,950 --> 02:43:28,350
Now, you know, they say, well all things are possible with God, and there's always the possibility of redemption.

1741
02:43:28,631 --> 02:43:34,830
No matter how serious the sin, but I'll tell you, sometimes people have no idea how to get back from where they went.

1742
02:43:38,235 --> 02:43:41,540
Well, and you can understand often why people wouldn't do that, right?

1743
02:43:42,061 --> 02:43:46,720
Yeah, well, that's a funny thing, because one of the things Carl Rogers said, too, about psychotherapy,

1744
02:43:46,821 --> 02:43:50,640
is that you can't do psychotherapy with someone who hasn't recognized that they have a problem.

1745
02:43:51,561 --> 02:43:58,528
So it's a massive thing to recognize that you have a problem, and it does open the door, perhaps, to recovery.

1746
02:43:58,528 --> 02:44:04,834
But it also means that you've recognized that you have a problem, and that can be very, very... It's the desert, right?

1747
02:44:04,834 --> 02:44:11,292
You're out of the tyranny, but you're in the desert, and the sun's beating down on you, and there's no necessary reason to presume that that you're going to survive.

1748
02:44:12,101 --> 02:44:12,223
So.

1749
02:44:13,563 --> 02:44:13,855
Thank you.

1750
02:44:13,980 --> 02:44:14,948
Have a good night and stay warm.

1751
02:44:16,420 --> 02:44:16,986
Thank you all.

1752
02:44:17,010 --> 02:44:19,890
对于一个要谈论《圣经》的人来说 这样的欢迎仪式实在是太糟糕了

1753
02:44:25,433 --> 02:44:33,266
因此 我本以为到了这一步 我早已讲完《创世纪》（开启后面的解读了） 但我也没有对这个速度感到不满

1754
02:44:33,853 --> 02:44:35,150
我学到了很多东西

1755
02:44:35,292 --> 02:44:40,769
希望我们今天能彻底读完《创世纪》

1756
02:44:41,852 --> 02:44:48,376
然后 我想我会尝试在五月开始读《出埃及记》 这取决于明年的情况

1757
02:44:49,192 --> 02:44:51,652
我的旅行日程很忙 但我真的很想做这件事

1758
02:44:51,712 --> 02:44:54,470
我非常喜欢《出埃及记》的故事 也非常了解它

1759
02:44:54,872 --> 02:45:03,351
《创世纪》中的许多故事 尤其是在前几个故事之后 一直说到
关于巴别塔 我必须做大量的学习 这真的很好

1760
02:45:03,532 --> 02:45:06,823
但我知道《出埃及记》的故事 所以我非常期待这个故事

1761
02:45:09,352 --> 02:45:12,044
那么 让我们直接进入主题 看看今天能学到什么程度

1762
02:45:13,872 --> 02:45:14,889
我们先回顾一下

1763
02:45:15,052 --> 02:45:24,357
约瑟的父亲是雅各布 雅各布是以色列的族长 十二个支派的父亲

1764
02:45:27,932 --> 02:45:41,462
我们可能还记得 他的人生道路在道德上是非常矛盾的

1765
02:45:41,542 --> 02:45:52,979
我认为《旧约全书》中的故事非常有趣的一点是 这些所谓的父权人物非常现实

1766
02:45:54,042 --> 02:45:54,613
这是

1767
02:45:55,324 --> 02:45:58,581
我也被《新约全书》中的描述所震撼

1768
02:45:58,782 --> 02:46:06,338
基督所做的很多事情 你会认为随着时间的推移会被剪辑掉 被净化 但事实并非如此

1769
02:46:06,762 --> 02:46:14,622
《旧约》绝对不是一本经过消毒的书

1770
02:46:14,622 --> 02:46:21,220
我一直在尝试得出一些关于《旧约全书》的一般性结论

1771
02:46:23,025 --> 02:46:32,042
《创世纪》故事的寓意 因为这些故事从根本上说是寓意道德的 而我认为寓意道德与行动有关

1772
02:46:32,142 --> 02:46:40,082
对 因为道德决定是你在调整行动时做出的决定 当你决定做一件事或另一件事时

1773
02:46:40,783 --> 02:46:44,881
一般来说 你想做的事情都是你能想到的最好的事情 而且

1774
02:46:46,543 --> 02:46:52,848
因此 这很好 但有时你也想做一些你能做的最糟糕的事情 你知道 因为你生气 怨恨或痛苦 而且

1775
02:46:54,643 --> 02:47:00,262
所以 你所做的道德决定支配着你的行为 是你一生中最重要的决定

1776
02:47:00,867 --> 02:47:05,882
并且 弄清楚如何做出道德决策并不容易 我们没有一种像对待经验现实那样准确无误的技术

1777
02:47:08,563 --> 02:47:15,842
从某些方面来说 经验现实的决策似乎简单得多

1778
02:47:17,703 --> 02:47:21,956
部分原因是我们可以集体努力 部分原因是我们有一套严格的决策方法

1779
02:47:21,956 --> 02:47:23,039
什么是真的 什么是假的

1780
02:47:25,704 --> 02:47:29,202
让我印象深刻的一件事就像是一个总的主题

1781
02:47:29,343 --> 02:47:35,029
我想说的是 它出现在《创世纪》里 尤其是在那些真正古老的故事之后

1782
02:47:36,142 --> 02:47:41,442
尤其是在该隐 亚伯和诺亚的故事之后

1783
02:47:43,664 --> 02:47:49,042
巴别塔的故事之后 当你读到历史上

1784
02:47:50,187 --> 02:47:55,019
历史上更真实的人的故事时 有一条禁令似乎是

1785
02:47:56,846 --> 02:47:58,301
出去做点什么吧

1786
02:47:59,303 --> 02:48:05,122
你知道我们谈论过的亚伯拉罕所有族长的一个重要主题是什么吗

1787
02:48:05,968 --> 02:48:14,132
雅各布和约瑟 他们都是不顾一切地走向世界

1788
02:48:15,254 --> 02:48:18,069
这在《旧约》的故事里就有

1789
02:48:18,069 --> 02:48:23,143
这基本上被描绘成听从上帝的声音 诸如此类

1790
02:48:23,143 --> 02:48:26,212
也许你可以把它理解为命运或心理召唤

1791
02:48:28,236 --> 02:48:33,172
有趣的是 这些人在听从召唤时并不轻松

1792
02:48:34,637 --> 02:48:39,672
所以 令人着迷的是 他们往往会马上遇到极端困难

1793
02:48:40,715 --> 02:48:46,532
我认为这非常有趣 首先因为生活显然充满了极端困难 其次

1794
02:48:47,452 --> 02:48:54,232
其次 这是不美化事物失败的又一个例子 这是我认为让一些甚至相当复杂的反宗教理论变得可笑的原因之一

1795
02:48:55,752 --> 02:49:01,252
就像弗洛伊德的理论 因为弗洛伊德将宗教视为一种愿望的实现

1796
02:49:02,274 --> 02:49:09,292
基本上是这样 还有马克思 他认为宗教是大众的鸦片

1797
02:49:11,057 --> 02:49:16,272
如果这些都是真的 在我看来 愿望会多得多 现实会少得多

1798
02:49:16,914 --> 02:49:18,699
少了很多严酷的现实

1799
02:49:18,699 --> 02:49:23,292
亚伯拉罕遇到的第一件事就是饥荒

1800
02:49:24,034 --> 02:49:30,292
然后他不得不把妻子藏起来 然后他就开始了暴政之旅

1801
02:49:31,115 --> 02:49:36,172
从某些方面来说 这已经是最糟糕的了 而且这些主题还在不断重复出现

1802
02:49:36,573 --> 02:49:38,481
没有人生活在他们应该生活的地方

1803
02:49:38,481 --> 02:49:41,252
他们生活在迦南 而不是应许之地

1804
02:49:41,352 --> 02:49:43,583
所以这一系列故事都很粗糙

1805
02:49:46,215 --> 02:49:51,292
但其基本思想是 没有时间闲坐了

1806
02:49:51,453 --> 02:49:54,091
有时间到外面的世界去闯荡

1807
02:49:54,674 --> 02:49:59,292
然后还暗示了正确和不正确的参与方式

1808
02:49:59,573 --> 02:50:08,721
对 所以很明显不恰当的交往方式我认为在该隐与亚伯的故事中被最清楚地界定了 与该隐有关

1809
02:50:09,832 --> 02:50:14,452
例证了与世界交往的不适当方式 那就是

1810
02:50:15,814 --> 02:50:19,432
以一种充满苦涩 嫉妒和怨恨的方式与世界交往

1811
02:50:20,854 --> 02:50:27,952
现在 该隐和亚伯的故事有哪些地方是我非常喜欢的 这个主题在兄弟俩的双重性中不断出现 对吗

1812
02:50:28,313 --> 02:50:37,452
该隐的观点与亚伯的观点之间不断发生冲突 而亚伯的观点与该隐的观点正好相反

1813
02:50:38,373 --> 02:50:46,432
该隐认为这个世界是个非常悲惨的地方 而且回报分配不公

1814
02:50:46,915 --> 02:50:49,912
有人做得更好 也有人做得更差

1815
02:50:50,474 --> 02:50:54,932
因此 他变得痛苦和怨恨 并诅咒上帝

1816
02:50:55,353 --> 02:51:01,032
然后他变得嗜杀成性 自相残杀 这甚至更糟 然后他摧毁了自己的理想

1817
02:51:01,393 --> 02:51:04,851
然后他的后代基本上就成了种族灭绝者 诸如此类

1818
02:51:05,615 --> 02:51:09,331
所以 这样做似乎是错误的

1819
02:51:09,955 --> 02:51:12,472
除非你的目的是让事情变得更糟

1820
02:51:12,653 --> 02:51:18,972
就像 该隐并不是只有有限的东西可以反对 没有什么可以反对的

1821
02:51:19,173 --> 02:51:20,561
他有很多东西可以反对

1822
02:51:20,561 --> 02:51:22,452
他的处境实际上是糟糕的

1823
02:51:22,853 --> 02:51:28,912
他的哥哥人见人爱 表现出色 什么都好 而他却黯然失色

1824
02:51:30,613 --> 02:51:38,360
故事对该隐失败的原因有点模棱两可 虽然有相当一部分原因是他自己造成的 但他肯定是失败了

1825
02:51:38,360 --> 02:51:45,588
所以你可以理解他为什么会有这种糟糕的态度 但问题是这只会让情况更糟

1826
02:51:45,588 --> 02:51:46,552
所以 这似乎并不是

1827
02:51:47,835 --> 02:51:55,532
作为一名心理学家 我在思考这类问题的过程中学到的一点是 识别出你不应该做什么往往比你应该做什么要容易得多

1828
02:51:56,294 --> 02:51:59,141
我认为邪恶比善良更容易识别

1829
02:51:59,141 --> 02:52:03,532
我认为善比较棘手 但恶在某种程度上比较突出

1830
02:52:03,813 --> 02:52:12,552
然后 至少你可以说 如果你想尽可能地远离它 我们甚至可以说 只是出于现实的原因 这样你的生活就不会变成地狱 你的家庭生活也不会变成地狱

1831
02:52:12,592 --> 02:52:18,152
该死的 即使你不能变出什么来 至少你可以尽可能地远离它

1832
02:52:18,374 --> 02:52:19,325
什么才是真正的目标

1833
02:52:20,416 --> 02:52:22,232
你至少可以避免这些陷阱

1834
02:52:23,193 --> 02:52:28,712
我也认为正是这样的陷阱

1835
02:52:28,873 --> 02:52:35,832
真正威胁到了我们现在的社会

1836
02:52:35,892 --> 02:52:42,825
你知道 我看到了怨恨的巨大增长 助长了几乎所有的政治两极分化 这正在发生 似乎不幸的是

1837
02:52:42,825 --> 02:52:47,705
现在 这并不意味着没有差距 但总是有差距

1838
02:52:47,705 --> 02:53:02,048
总之 雅各布 当然 雅各布和丽贝卡欺骗了以扫 雅各布最终得到了以撒的祝福 所以这是一场道德灾难

1839
02:53:02,048 --> 02:53:10,223
然后他不得不逃跑 因为他哥哥要杀他 这又是自相残杀的动机 我也喜欢这个动机

1840
02:53:10,223 --> 02:53:12,012
我觉得这很真实

1841
02:53:12,052 --> 02:53:17,412
你知道弗洛伊德经常提到的一件事 这也是弗洛伊德真正天才的地方

1842
02:53:18,813 --> 02:53:27,732
最强烈的恨 有时也是最强烈的爱 就在家庭里 在弗洛伊德的精神病理学世界里

1843
02:53:29,457 --> 02:53:33,659
这一切都发生在家庭内部

1844
02:53:33,659 --> 02:53:38,972
事实上 弗洛伊德世界里的病理学 就是家庭内部的病理学

1845
02:53:39,373 --> 02:53:48,972
因为陷入弗洛伊德家庭梦魇的人 在结构上大致是恋母情结 他们只能从家庭关系的角度来认识世界

1846
02:53:49,193 --> 02:53:55,932
他们已经被这种纠缠 创伤 欺骗 背叛 模糊的界限以及所有这些所伤害

1847
02:53:55,992 --> 02:54:01,089
他们无法超越家庭 走向世界

1848
02:54:01,972 --> 02:54:12,143
因此 兄弟之间可以互相斗争 我认为这是一个非常强大的想法 而这并不是人们喜欢去想的事情

1849
02:54:13,932 --> 02:54:19,727
雅各布不得不离开 这并不奇怪 因为他的所作所为应该受到谴责 他背叛了自己的兄弟

1850
02:54:20,172 --> 02:54:24,807
但尽管如此 他还是梦见了连接天地的天梯

1851
02:54:26,272 --> 02:54:28,948
这是件非常反常的事 你知道吗

1852
02:54:29,632 --> 02:54:33,871
但我认为它的作用之一是 在某种意义上 它给每个人带来了希望

1853
02:54:34,112 --> 02:54:39,931
因为它不是 你知道 如果只有好人赢了 我们就真的有麻烦了 对吗

1854
02:54:40,112 --> 02:54:41,664
因为做个好人没那么容易

1855
02:54:42,792 --> 02:54:43,771
真的没那么容易

1856
02:54:43,832 --> 02:54:55,072
大多数人都能敏锐地意识到自己的不足 甚至是自己的理想 因此 如果除了好人 几乎所有人都没有希望的话

1857
02:54:55,132 --> 02:55:04,052
那么我们中的很多人都会迷失方向 所以这也是我非常喜欢《旧约全书》故事的一点 也是我比较惊讶的一点

1858
02:55:04,092 --> 02:55:14,932
他们的生活非常复杂 而且按照任何人的标准 他们都犯了非常严重的道德错误 但如果 但总的信息仍然是充满希望的 而且《蝙蝠侠》《格林童话》的故事仍然是充满希望的

1859
02:55:14,932 --> 02:55:24,128
与 "恶 "的信息相反的信息 比如说 "善 "的信息 是这样的：这里非常强调信仰 对吗

1860
02:55:25,132 --> 02:55:39,509
这是个难题 因为那些对宗教结构持嘲讽态度的人 喜欢把信仰看作是为了迷信而不惜摧毁自己的智慧

1861
02:55:40,772 --> 02:55:49,969
这种观点有一定道理 但并不完全正确 因为现实要复杂得多

1862
02:55:50,192 --> 02:55:56,771
《旧约》中所坚持的部分信仰是

1863
02:55:57,032 --> 02:56:04,395
我在这里再次从心理学的角度来说 提出一个崇高的目标是有益的

1864
02:56:05,593 --> 02:56:07,690
我真的认为这在实践中也很有用

1865
02:56:08,133 --> 02:56:12,592
我们通过未来创作计划所做的研究例如明确指出

1866
02:56:12,992 --> 02:56:18,312
如果你让人们构想一个平衡的理想 你知道 你希望你的家庭拥有什么

1867
02:56:18,412 --> 02:56:19,598
你对事业有什么要求

1868
02:56:19,598 --> 02:56:20,944
你对教育有什么要求

1869
02:56:20,944 --> 02:56:22,872
你对性格发展有何要求

1870
02:56:22,932 --> 02:56:25,231
你打算如何利用工作以外的时间

1871
02:56:27,614 --> 02:56:31,732
在你可能会冲动的地方 你打算如何安排使用毒品和酒精

1872
02:56:32,213 --> 02:56:37,512
如果你真的想清楚了 并有了一个综合的理想 你如何避免陷入可怕的深渊

1873
02:56:37,512 --> 02:56:42,231
如果你把它作为你要达到的目标 那么你就会

1874
02:56:44,213 --> 02:56:50,111
以更加积极的方式投身于这个世界 你就不会再被焦虑和不确定性所折磨 也不会

1875
02:56:51,273 --> 02:56:56,212
这就说得通了 因为你还活着 还拥有一切 所以

1876
02:56:57,413 --> 02:57:03,172
除非你是披头士 否则你无法与你的存在事实表现出某种积极的关系

1877
02:57:04,035 --> 02:57:06,492
那怎么可能不是地狱呢

1878
02:57:07,296 --> 02:57:14,712
因为你会感到焦虑和可怕 因为你很脆弱 没有什么有用的或值得做的事

1879
02:57:15,536 --> 02:57:24,632
我不认为这对任何人来说会是制胜的法宝

1880
02:57:24,672 --> 02:57:33,792
你可以为采取这种策略提出合理的理由

1881
02:57:34,033 --> 02:57:38,185
你知道你可以说 没有证据证明超越的道德或终极的意义

1882
02:57:38,185 --> 02:57:40,752
当然 心理学家对此也有很多论述

1883
02:57:42,133 --> 02:57:45,562
比如卡尔-罗杰斯 荣格 还有弗洛伊德

1884
02:57:45,562 --> 02:57:53,712
大多数伟大的心理学家都指出 你知道 你可以从自己的经验中获得可靠的合理信息

1885
02:57:53,772 --> 02:58:04,089
特别是如果你还能与其他人交流 你就能从自己的生活中看出 你是走在一条富有成效的道路上 让自己变得更高尚 更有智慧 还是走在一条破坏性的道路上

1886
02:58:04,972 --> 02:58:19,104
我认为 认为这两条道路之间的对立可能是真实存在的 你知道 这是很有用的 因为这也能让你相信自己对这种事情的直觉

1887
02:58:19,952 --> 02:58:25,211
但我不这么认为 无论如何 我认为既然你还活着

1888
02:58:25,673 --> 02:58:31,712
对自己活着的事实以及自己周围有其他活着的生物的事实 采取最大可能的尊重

1889
02:58:32,195 --> 02:58:35,352
我只是不明白这怎么会被理解为一种失败的策略

1890
02:58:36,415 --> 02:58:39,532
所以这是第一件事 所以这就像信仰 对吧 这就是信仰

1891
02:58:40,093 --> 02:58:46,632
这不仅仅是对你的存在的信念 而是对存在本身的信念 这种信念可能类似于

1892
02:58:47,453 --> 02:58:54,052
如果你能够适当地定位你的存在 那么也许这会让你与存在本身相协调 你永远不会知道

1893
02:58:54,719 --> 02:58:55,931
我是说 这可能是真的

1894
02:58:57,635 --> 02:59:00,152
没有理由假设这不是真的

1895
02:59:00,253 --> 02:59:07,529
我的意思是 即使你只是从严格的生物学角度来看待这个问题 并把我们看作是35亿年进化的产物

1896
02:59:07,529 --> 02:59:15,032
我的意思是 我们已经挣扎了数十亿年 才得以存活下来 并使自己与现实相匹配

1897
02:59:15,735 --> 02:59:20,352
因为我经常想的一件事就是 你知道生活绝对是艰难的

1898
02:59:20,653 --> 02:59:28,009
毫无疑问 这是不公平的 存在着不平等和所有这些事情 人们遭受着各种可怕的事情 但我也想知道

1899
02:59:29,555 --> 02:59:32,572
如果你不积极地让事情变得更糟

1900
02:59:33,813 --> 02:59:39,302
情况又会好到哪里去  因为人们都很自私

1901
02:59:40,455 --> 02:59:42,992
他们喜欢彼此分隔的房子

1902
02:59:43,715 --> 02:59:46,292
它们同时指向六个不同的方向

1903
02:59:47,035 --> 02:59:51,692
因为怨恨和不满 他们的工作与自己背道而驰

1904
02:59:53,236 --> 02:59:59,532
未经处理的记忆 童年的仇恨 未经审查的假设

1905
03:00:00,714 --> 03:00:06,972
你不禁要问 你是否能抛开这些 正确地定位自己

1906
03:00:08,073 --> 03:00:14,372
在《旧约全书》中得到了很好的强调 当然这也贯穿了整个《圣经》 那就是：

1907
03:00:15,456 --> 03:00:19,812
仅仅建立与存在的积极关系是不够的 我认为这是最重要的

1908
03:00:20,957 --> 03:00:22,250
这是对信念的一个很好的描述

1909
03:00:23,315 --> 03:00:26,292
你必须做出这个决定 因为存在本身非常矛盾

1910
03:00:26,513 --> 03:00:30,772
你可以认为 也许存在本就是个不应该发生的事情

1911
03:00:31,633 --> 03:00:38,092
但这对我来说似乎并不产生积极效果 而信仰似乎是我要行动起来

1912
03:00:38,572 --> 03:00:43,272
好像存在最终是合理的 然后如果我适当地参与其中 我将会改善它而不是让它变得更糟

1913
03:00:43,372 --> 03:00:49,052
因此 我认为这就是信仰宣言 而与信仰宣言相辅相成的是以下内容

1914
03:00:50,595 --> 03:00:58,792
你知道 即使像雅各布这样一开始就在道德上非常矛盾的人

1915
03:00:59,253 --> 03:01:05,572
他们经历的一切让他们备受打击 而似乎发生的是 他们被锤炼成了某种道德形态

1916
03:01:05,914 --> 03:01:08,652
所以在他们人生旅途的中点

1917
03:01:09,334 --> 03:01:19,792
有一些人是你可以信任的 他们不会背叛自己 也不会背叛同胞 所以这是很有趣的

1918
03:01:22,097 --> 03:01:26,452
在我看来 首先假设你必须

1919
03:01:27,232 --> 03:01:32,031
与某种超凡脱俗的东西建立关系 甚至可能只是未来版本的你

1920
03:01:33,074 --> 03:01:40,352
其次 你必须以真实的方式与现实保持一致 这是你最好的选择

1921
03:01:44,998 --> 03:01:51,252
圣经故事实际上对此也相当现实 因为它们并没有真正说如果你这样做

1922
03:01:51,552 --> 03:01:56,172
你就会被立即传送到应许之地 就像我们在《出埃及记》的故事中发现的摩西一样

1923
03:01:56,533 --> 03:02:06,911
他从未到达过应许之地 因此 并不是你直率地走向世界 就能立即得到最终的救赎

1924
03:02:07,473 --> 03:02:18,552
与存在建立忠实的关系 并试图以正直的方式行事 但这是你最好的选择 而且可能已经足够好了

1925
03:02:18,612 --> 03:02:31,852
即使这还不够好 它确实比另一种选择要好 而另一种选择似乎在个人和社会两方面都近似于地狱

1926
03:02:31,992 --> 03:02:35,965
所以约瑟的父亲是雅各布 也就是后来的以色列 与上帝搏斗的人

1927
03:02:35,965 --> 03:02:39,259
我们已经谈过这个问题了

1928
03:02:39,259 --> 03:02:44,904
我一直在说的是 我认为我们在某种程度上都会这样做

1929
03:02:44,904 --> 03:02:48,297
我们与现实本身搏斗 这是肯定的

1930
03:02:48,297 --> 03:02:55,912
不仅是我们所理解的现实 还有我们所不理解的现实 那是一种超越现实的现实 然后也许是任何现实之外的现实

1931
03:02:55,992 --> 03:03:04,452
因为犹太教和基督教对上帝的经典概念是有时间和空间的 当然也有很多关于存在的东西

1932
03:03:04,653 --> 03:03:12,092
在时间和空间中存在着很多我们完全不了解的东西 从这个意义上说那是超验的 但也有一种观点认为在时间和空间之外还有一个领域

1933
03:03:12,212 --> 03:03:22,132
这是个有趣的想法 我认为是个非常复杂的想法 而不是一个简单的想法 很难知道该怎么理解它

1934
03:03:22,513 --> 03:03:33,132
这其实并不重要 因为我认为无论你对这类事物的态度在智力上如何 你最终还是会像雅各一样

1935
03:03:34,173 --> 03:03:36,619
从所有意图和目的上来说 实际上是这样的

1936
03:03:36,619 --> 03:03:44,299
因为我认为没有人在他们生命中的某个时刻 或许甚至是每天 不在某个层面上与上帝搏斗

1937
03:03:44,299 --> 03:03:51,105
我想 如果你想把它还原的话 你可以称之为现实的本质

1938
03:03:51,105 --> 03:03:52,112
但我不认为这有什么区别

1939
03:03:52,232 --> 03:03:59,252
这仍然是你无法摆脱的东西 你要挣扎的不仅是现实本身的性质

1940
03:03:59,453 --> 03:04:03,352
还有你与它的道德关系的本质 你与它的行为关系的本质

1941
03:04:03,392 --> 03:04:08,832
所以这就是你应该如何看待它 以及你应该如何自处 然后是

1942
03:04:10,032 --> 03:04:14,612
正确处理的好处是否值得付出困难和代价

1943
03:04:15,155 --> 03:04:18,152
所以在我看来 这只是一个直接的存在论陈述 你知道的

1944
03:04:18,996 --> 03:04:22,912
雅各布因搏斗而受伤 这也非常现实

1945
03:04:25,454 --> 03:04:28,052
无论如何 他最终也成为约瑟的父亲

1946
03:04:28,112 --> 03:04:35,052
约瑟是他最喜爱的儿子 是在他老年时他最爱的妻子给他生出的儿子 这就是我们今天要讨论的人

1947
03:04:36,196 --> 03:04:48,490
所以你记得 雅各是以色列十二支派的祖先 有他的妻子们和由此产生的后代

1948
03:04:48,490 --> 03:04:49,292
那些都是儿子们

1949
03:04:49,493 --> 03:04:55,052
还有一个名叫底拿的女儿 而拉结是他真正爱的女人

1950
03:04:55,192 --> 03:04:59,808
他和拉结生的是约瑟 那是在他年长的时候 所以从某种意义上说

1951
03:04:59,808 --> 03:05:01,112
为什么约瑟是他的最爱

1952
03:05:04,633 --> 03:05:13,812
这是约瑟故事的开头 以色列人雅各布爱约瑟胜过爱他所有的孩子 因为约瑟是他年老时的儿子 他给约瑟做了一件五颜六色的外衣

1953
03:05:14,893 --> 03:05:17,440
这两句话包含了很多内容

1954
03:05:17,440 --> 03:05:22,012
首先 以色列爱约瑟胜过爱他所有的孩子

1955
03:05:23,534 --> 03:05:27,992
这可能是我们在之前的故事中看到的不太好的事情之一

1956
03:05:28,072 --> 03:05:33,652
那就是 只要父母明显偏爱一个孩子而不是另一个孩子

1957
03:05:35,054 --> 03:05:49,551
比如雅各和以扫 拉结最喜欢雅各 以撒最喜欢以扫

1958
03:05:49,551 --> 03:05:50,372
但结果并非如此

1959
03:05:50,633 --> 03:05:53,730
这让整个家族的结构发生了变化

1960
03:05:53,730 --> 03:05:57,105
所以一开始就有个警告

1961
03:05:57,105 --> 03:06:02,291
你可能会说 你不能不偏爱一个孩子或另一个孩子 但我不知道这是不是真的

1962
03:06:02,291 --> 03:06:06,900
当然 这也是你应该非常谨慎的事情 因为看起来效果并不好

1963
03:06:06,900 --> 03:06:09,332
因为他是晚年的儿子 这很正常

1964
03:06:09,696 --> 03:06:14,852
他给他做了一件五颜六色的外衣 那件五颜六色的外衣是个非常有趣的形象

1965
03:06:15,633 --> 03:06:21,252
所以我要深入探讨一下这个想法 因为它就像书中所说的那样 奠定了基础

1966
03:06:21,412 --> 03:06:24,241
约瑟是一个什么样的人 他被宠爱

1967
03:06:24,241 --> 03:06:25,344
他更年轻

1968
03:06:25,344 --> 03:06:27,952
他受宠 但他也有一件特殊的衣服

1969
03:06:28,992 --> 03:06:34,312
我从分析女性梦境中学到的其中一件事就是

1970
03:06:34,854 --> 03:06:39,792
根据我的经验 女性经常在梦中把服装当作一种角色 并且

1971
03:06:40,637 --> 03:06:42,052
因此 如果你在解释女人的梦境时

1972
03:06:42,233 --> 03:06:46,052
那么如果她们穿上祖母的鞋子

1973
03:06:46,473 --> 03:06:52,992
那么你就会很快明白 这个梦是在试图把她们自己的行为 和某些事情联系起来

1974
03:06:53,012 --> 03:07:03,351
这是作为祖母的状态或特定祖母的特征 这是有道理的 因为衣服可以保护自己 但它也象征着一种角色

1975
03:07:04,493 --> 03:07:11,805
有趣的是 在《旧约全书》的故事中 如果有人要行骗 他们往往会改变自己的装束

1976
03:07:12,892 --> 03:07:15,491
当你欺骗别人的时候 你就会这么做 对吗

1977
03:07:15,572 --> 03:07:17,211
你把自己打扮成别人

1978
03:07:17,332 --> 03:07:19,146
你把自己打扮成别人

1979
03:07:20,012 --> 03:07:23,007
不管怎么说 回到 "彩色外衣 "上来

1980
03:07:23,972 --> 03:07:33,271
要想一件东西有多种颜色 它就得涵盖所有的可能性

1981
03:07:33,772 --> 03:07:44,520
这就暗示着 如果你想成为一个成熟的人 你就必须表现出非常多的特质

1982
03:07:45,562 --> 03:07:47,261
因此 我想对这一观点进行一些探讨

1983
03:07:47,322 --> 03:07:53,961
我想谈的第一件事是 我们已经了解到 当你去到一个新环境时会发生什么

1984
03:07:54,624 --> 03:08:04,982
你知道 在临床心理学中有这样一个非常深刻的想法 一个基本的想法 那就是如果有人对某事感到焦虑 你所做的就是

1985
03:08:05,082 --> 03:08:11,279
如果这种焦虑阻碍了他们 你就把他们焦虑的事物定义出来 因为这已经限定了它 对吗

1986
03:08:11,482 --> 03:08:14,760
因为焦虑的问题之一就是你不会说出来

1987
03:08:15,102 --> 03:08:15,995
就像伏地魔一样

1988
03:08:16,442 --> 03:08:19,462
然后 如果你不说 它就会比它应该说的更大

1989
03:08:19,663 --> 03:08:21,917
一旦你开始谈论它 你就会把它缩小

1990
03:08:22,782 --> 03:08:24,961
所以 原因有很多

1991
03:08:25,042 --> 03:08:32,517
这是因为你并不像你想象的那样害怕 你并不像你想象的那样害怕很多事情 你比你自己知道的更勇敢 更有能力

1992
03:08:33,482 --> 03:08:36,641
所以 只要你有足够的勇气开始谈论你害怕的东西

1993
03:08:37,083 --> 03:08:41,441
然后你就会发现 你比你想象的要强大 问题也比你想象的要小

1994
03:08:42,284 --> 03:08:47,522
然后 你可以把它进一步分解成更小的问题 然后你就可以想出如何解决这些更小的问题

1995
03:08:48,023 --> 03:08:54,162
因此 在我看来 这并不是说你变得不那么害怕了 而是你变得更勇敢了

1996
03:08:54,303 --> 03:08:57,782
这比不那么害怕要好得多 因为有很多事情值得害怕

1997
03:08:57,883 --> 03:09:00,322
所以 如果你有勇气 那就真的会成功

1998
03:09:00,884 --> 03:09:09,921
现在的问题是 如果你很不善于社交 不知道如何自我介绍 也不知道如何与人交流 那该怎么办

1999
03:09:10,742 --> 03:09:20,502
与任何人建立关系的初始部分 然后你开始将自己置于需要你这样做的情境中 那么问题来了 情况如何

2000
03:09:21,122 --> 03:09:24,935
从技术上讲 你转变得好 你就学得好

2001
03:09:24,935 --> 03:09:33,942
如果你面对的是一个特别不善于社交的人 而你正在对他进行心理治疗 这意味着什么

2002
03:09:34,002 --> 03:09:39,362
你可以教他们如何正确地与人握手 如何叫出对方的名字 如何记住对方的名字

2003
03:09:39,844 --> 03:09:44,122
因此 你只需和他们一起练习 这样他们就能掌握行动习惯了

2004
03:09:44,485 --> 03:09:46,942
因此 这种形式的知识已经融入了你的身体

2005
03:09:47,103 --> 03:09:52,582
就像看着一个人 伸出你的手 握一握 不要像死人一样

2006
03:09:53,026 --> 03:09:54,922
但你知道 在合理的控制下

2007
03:09:55,783 --> 03:10:00,902
说出你的名字 不要喃喃自语 看着他们 让他们能听到你的声音 然后当他们说出自己的名字时

2008
03:10:01,042 --> 03:10:07,182
尽量记住它 就是这样 然后你就可以和人们一起练习 这样他们就会发展出一些运动技能 对吗

2009
03:10:07,302 --> 03:10:13,482
然后你就可以对他们说 你还可以做另一件事 那就是

2010
03:10:13,582 --> 03:10:18,322
当你开始对话时 不要坐在那里思考下一句要说什么

2011
03:10:19,066 --> 03:10:22,522
因为那么你就不会关注这个人 你会让自己出丑 因为

2012
03:10:23,828 --> 03:10:26,868
你会表现得不自然 对吗

2013
03:10:26,868 --> 03:10:33,851
因为如果你在跳舞时只注意自己的脚在哪里 那么你就会一直踩到对方

2014
03:10:33,851 --> 03:10:43,800
因此 你要关注对方 然后你所拥有的自动化社交知识就会凸显出来 所以如果你有社交焦虑 这是件好事 对吗

2015
03:10:43,800 --> 03:10:53,282
如果你在社交场合 你应该做的一件事就是更多地关注与你交谈的人而不是更少 你应该尽可能少地关注自己

2016
03:10:53,885 --> 03:10:56,322
所以 如果你觉得自己因为焦虑而陷入其中

2017
03:10:56,804 --> 03:11:05,702
然后你要做的就是将你的注意力转移到这个人身上 因为你的社交程度越高 你所有的自动反应就会开始发挥作用 但无论如何

2018
03:11:05,863 --> 03:11:13,962
所以 你要走到社会中去 学会与人握手 学会倾听他们的倾诉 学会向他们提问 因为这是接下来要做的事情

2019
03:11:14,223 --> 03:11:21,982
你不能随便问他们问题 但如果他们开始跟你说话 而你不明白他们在说什么

2020
03:11:22,062 --> 03:11:25,262
或者他们说的话很有趣 你就问他们一个问题

2021
03:11:25,604 --> 03:11:32,302
他们非常高兴 因为这意味着你在真正关注他们 而人们其实很喜欢被关注

2022
03:11:32,443 --> 03:11:42,902
因为这很少发生 所以他们非常非常喜欢 所以好吧 那么发生了什么呢

2023
03:11:42,982 --> 03:11:52,022
眼睛看哪里 手放在哪里 嘴唇怎么动 就像真正的具身知识 这是一种特殊的记忆 你在练习它

2024
03:11:52,082 --> 03:12:03,342
这样 你就掌握了新的技能 然后 通过倾听对方和观察自己的互动 你也会产生新的抽象概念

2025
03:12:03,523 --> 03:12:06,542
使你能够以不同方式构思世界的信息

2026
03:12:07,144 --> 03:12:12,102
因此 如果你走出去 与 10 个不同的人或 50 个不同的人交谈

2027
03:12:12,644 --> 03:12:18,222
然后你可以听听这 50 个人说了什么 你可以看看他们是如何表达的

2028
03:12:18,663 --> 03:12:24,642
你收集的知识库会改变你的认知方式 从而拓宽你作为社会活动家的视野

2029
03:12:25,263 --> 03:12:29,662
好了 这是两种知识形式 但还有第三种知识形式非常有趣 那就是

2030
03:12:30,767 --> 03:12:34,428
你知道你有很大的生物潜能

2031
03:12:34,428 --> 03:12:42,375
我们很难知道什么是潜能 但潜能的一部分就是你能够产生你没有产生过的蛋白质

2032
03:12:42,375 --> 03:12:43,842
所以 顺便说一句 你应该马上去做

2033
03:12:44,444 --> 03:12:49,342
因此 如果你把自己置身于一个全新的环境中 你就会发现这在某种程度上是可行的

2034
03:12:49,964 --> 03:12:59,158
在你的大脑中 有一些基因开关会因为新情况的需要而打开 从而编码出新的蛋白质

2035
03:12:59,158 --> 03:13:05,842
所以 就好像你有潜在的软件 这会是一种思考方式 它只会在你进入需要它的情况下被激活

2036
03:13:06,143 --> 03:13:14,422
如果你走进那种必要的情境 那么你可能会想 如果是这样 如果你去了很多不同的地方 你能被激活多少

2037
03:13:14,462 --> 03:13:24,382
这是一个非常非常深刻的问题 因为关于你应该如何整理你的生活的深层答案之一

2038
03:13:25,025 --> 03:13:30,680
是你应该去很多地方 激活你自己

2039
03:13:31,823 --> 03:13:45,201
我想稍微讲解一下 因为有一个非常丰富的象征世界表达了这一点 所以现在关于拥有多彩外衣的想法是指

2040
03:13:46,944 --> 03:13:51,662
那个人是适当的领导者 因为记住或者适当的人物 这两者是相同的

2041
03:13:52,284 --> 03:13:58,242
这些古老的故事试图表达和思考的问题之一是 你应该如何行动

2042
03:13:58,584 --> 03:14:07,822
这与什么是理想是一样的 都是同一个问题 而约瑟在这里的提示是 你应该穿上一件多种颜色的外衣

2043
03:14:07,963 --> 03:14:14,841
这意味着 你应该可以和那些正在你家干砌墙的人一起去酒吧喝上一杯

2044
03:14:15,265 --> 03:14:24,720
你也应该能够与受过更多抽象教育的人进行复杂的对话 也许你应该在两种情况下都同样自如 对吗

2045
03:14:24,720 --> 03:14:27,973
因为你可能会想 好吧 还有更多

2046
03:14:27,973 --> 03:14:35,200
其中一个迹象表明 你有更大的潜力 那就是你可以被放在更多的地方并正常工作

2047
03:14:35,200 --> 03:14:40,622
这将是一个很好的目标 因为 这里的另一个问题是

2048
03:14:40,863 --> 03:14:51,881
你完全知道 生活中的基本悲剧 以及你在生活中遭遇的恶意 所以这些都是最糟糕的事情 你能改变的并不多

2049
03:14:52,343 --> 03:14:55,715
从根本上说 因为它们是存在的条件

2050
03:14:55,715 --> 03:15:00,131
你会受到自己弱点的影响 也会受到恶意的影响

2051
03:15:00,131 --> 03:15:02,439
就是这样

2052
03:15:02,439 --> 03:15:05,231
你不能躲避它 因为这实际上会让它变得更糟

2053
03:15:05,231 --> 03:15:06,617
所以 你被它困住了

2054
03:15:06,617 --> 03:15:08,866
那么问题来了 你有什么选择呢

2055
03:15:08,866 --> 03:15:18,597
一个选择是诅咒存在的结构因为它恶意和悲惨 这是可以理解的 另一个选择是

2056
03:15:19,042 --> 03:15:24,262
让自己变得如此明显不同且充满活力和能力 以至于你超越了这些挑战

2057
03:15:25,303 --> 03:15:30,095
现在看来 这并不是一件容易的事 但这并不重要 因为还有其他选择吗

2058
03:15:30,095 --> 03:15:32,642
没有更好的替代方案 这一点也值得了解

2059
03:15:34,610 --> 03:15:34,773
那么

2060
03:15:37,606 --> 03:15:42,677
你会在最奇怪的地方看到这些想法的表达 所以我们已经聊了一会儿

2061
03:15:42,677 --> 03:15:46,692
我想 在这个关于匹诺曹的系列中 如果我们还没有 那就无所谓了

2062
03:15:48,714 --> 03:16:02,502
你看 《木偶奇遇记》电影开场时 蟋蟀杰迷你指着一颗星星 这颗星星大致就是耶稣诞生的星星

2063
03:16:04,184 --> 03:16:06,177
它象征着像钻石一样纯净的东西 对吗

2064
03:16:07,448 --> 03:16:12,822
在黑暗中闪烁 超凡脱俗 高出地平线 让你目不转睛

2065
03:16:13,145 --> 03:16:14,196
因此

2066
03:16:14,822 --> 03:16:16,458
问题是 你在技术上需要

2067
03:16:16,822 --> 03:16:18,277
之所以需要这样做 是因为

2068
03:16:19,953 --> 03:16:26,721
我们现在对心理学有了足够的了解 知道几乎所有的积极情绪都会在你的生活中体验到 而积极情绪是

2069
03:16:26,822 --> 03:16:34,822
顺便说一句 它实际上是镇痛剂 所以它不仅有积极作用 还能消除消极情绪 这几乎是所有积极情绪的一大优点

2070
03:16:34,822 --> 03:16:38,622
你会感受到 你会感受到与目标之间的关系

2071
03:16:39,724 --> 03:16:42,701
因为当你接近目标时 你会感受到积极的情绪

2072
03:16:43,583 --> 03:16:46,636
因此 如果你想感受到积极的情绪 那么你就需要一个目标

2073
03:16:46,636 --> 03:16:57,002
然后你可能会想 好吧 如果你想最大限度地调动这种积极情绪 也就是热情 也是把你拉到世界上的东西 同时也是感觉良好的东西 那么你就需要一个尽可能好的目标

2074
03:16:57,624 --> 03:17:02,288
嗯 因为这会吸引你最大的部分

2075
03:17:03,582 --> 03:17:08,462
就像如果你的目标太窄 那么你们中的很多人就不会参与其中

2076
03:17:08,542 --> 03:17:11,482
你知道目标是否完善且具有多面性

2077
03:17:12,063 --> 03:17:18,422
然后 你们所有人都能参与其中 即使是你们的消极因素 即使是你们的愤怒和恐惧 也能参与其中

2078
03:17:18,603 --> 03:17:20,561
比方说 你需要一个守门员

2079
03:17:20,561 --> 03:17:26,022
这就是值得的 你得觉得自己很棒 你需要一个目标来证明生活中的悲剧和恶意是合理的

2080
03:17:26,904 --> 03:17:29,453
这似乎是现在的底线

2081
03:17:29,453 --> 03:17:30,195
也许你想得很好

2082
03:17:30,195 --> 03:17:31,560
没有什么目标能做到这一点

2083
03:17:31,560 --> 03:17:37,852
这就好比 嗯 目标还是有好坏之分的

2084
03:17:38,614 --> 03:17:42,070
所以 我不相信没有目标能做到这一点

2085
03:17:42,593 --> 03:17:43,944
我认为这是一个未决问题

2086
03:17:44,912 --> 03:17:52,449
你永远不会知道 直到你追求适当目标的时间足够长 才会发现追求目标的结果是你会成为什么样的人

2087
03:17:52,932 --> 03:17:55,812
这也是你的命运或你的生存之旅 对吗

2088
03:17:55,852 --> 03:17:58,168
这也不是别人能为你做的

2089
03:17:58,832 --> 03:18:02,504
有人会说 看在上帝的份上 振作起来 开始行动吧

2090
03:18:04,992 --> 03:18:10,389
让世界对你最美好 但你不做就不可能知道 所以

2091
03:18:13,293 --> 03:18:21,804
除非你认为自己在这方面做得特别出色 否则你没有理由怀疑它的潜在有效性

2092
03:18:21,804 --> 03:18:24,292
所以 再加上 就像蟋蟀告诉你这一点 所以

2093
03:18:25,913 --> 03:18:28,682
你知道 他们的消息来源非常可靠

2094
03:18:28,682 --> 03:18:38,812
好了 你看到了星星 星星在《木偶奇遇记》中反复出现 其中一个更有趣的元素是 当吉派托想要改造他的木偶时

2095
03:18:39,414 --> 03:18:43,932
被幕后势力玩弄的提线木偶

2096
03:18:44,173 --> 03:18:53,372
从荣格心理学的角度来看 这是对人格的一个非常好的定义 对吧 同时也是对意识形态或概念附体的一种暗示

2097
03:18:54,773 --> 03:19:03,172
吉派托是个好人 他是个正面的父亲形象 尽管他是个家长式的人物 对吧 而且还是个非常能干的家长

2098
03:19:03,272 --> 03:19:11,946
他甚至还在举目仰望 希望他的创造物能超越他的存在方式（尽管它是积极的）

2099
03:19:12,813 --> 03:19:19,441
进行某种转变 使其能够自主 并作为道德主体充分发挥作用

2100
03:19:19,441 --> 03:19:20,787
没有附加条件 对吧

2101
03:19:20,787 --> 03:19:22,092
因此 我认为这非常有趣

2102
03:19:23,356 --> 03:19:28,471
索尔仁尼琴说 人类的救赎只在于使一切成为所有人的关注

2103
03:19:30,174 --> 03:19:33,007
这是一个相当不错的星辰般的目标

2104
03:19:33,007 --> 03:19:39,732
我想说的是 木偶奇遇记中发生的事情是因为 我认为这是一个象征性的故事

2105
03:19:40,172 --> 03:19:45,972
如果你把自己置身于新的环境中 就会在基因水平上发生我刚才向你描述的情况

2106
03:19:45,972 --> 03:19:50,450
所以 在匹诺曹的故事中 吉佩托大致就是文化 对吗

2107
03:19:50,892 --> 03:19:55,169
他是个工匠 他制作了木偶奇遇记

2108
03:19:56,173 --> 03:20:01,550
所以他 也就是他的儿子 是社交媒介

2109
03:20:02,092 --> 03:20:10,268
他的目标是超越单纯的社会化 我认为这是人类神秘因素的一部分

2110
03:20:10,452 --> 03:20:14,389
要知道 在我们的科学模型中 基本上有社会学和生物学

2111
03:20:14,972 --> 03:20:24,549
但神话故事中总会有第三个元素 那就是你可以理解为与自由意志相关的意识的自发行为

2112
03:20:25,352 --> 03:20:29,606
要知道 这基本上就是宗教术语中类似灵魂的概念

2113
03:20:30,072 --> 03:20:38,448
而我们在科学上并没有这样的分类 因为我们在科学上试图做的是将一切归结为社会学或生物学

2114
03:20:39,392 --> 03:20:46,785
但从科学层面的实用性角度来看 我并不清楚这是否完全合理

2115
03:20:47,352 --> 03:20:50,409
你不想在必要之外增加解释原则

2116
03:20:50,852 --> 03:20:54,092
但是 还有很多事情是无法接受的 例如

2117
03:20:54,112 --> 03:20:58,791
我们都把彼此当作拥有自由意志的自主生命 这似乎行得通

2118
03:20:58,912 --> 03:21:01,885
如果我们停止这样做 事情就会迅速恶化

2119
03:21:03,352 --> 03:21:11,844
虽然我们已经能够从形而上学或物理学的角度 将有意识的自由意志概念化 但这并不意味着它不存在

2120
03:21:11,844 --> 03:21:13,432
这只能说明我们不了解它

2121
03:21:14,095 --> 03:21:17,292
我的意思是 直到最近 15 年 我们才发现

2122
03:21:18,495 --> 03:21:21,572
宇宙的 95% 是由某种物质构成的 而我们甚至无法

2123
03:21:23,094 --> 03:21:26,671
我们甚至无法想象它的特性 只知道它似乎能用数学（来描述）

2124
03:21:29,353 --> 03:21:33,532
总之 当吉派托举目仰望那颗星星时 会发生什么呢

2125
03:21:33,692 --> 03:21:41,052
所以 这是社会与个人发展的正确目标保持一致 对吗

2126
03:21:41,213 --> 03:21:46,172
因此 与其说社会与个人之间存在矛盾 不如说社会与个人是一致的

2127
03:21:46,777 --> 03:21:48,672
然后大自然就会加入进来

2128
03:21:48,672 --> 03:21:55,312
这就是匹诺曹故事中的蓝精灵 在我看来 它象征着生物学上发生的事情

2129
03:21:57,554 --> 03:22:02,092
当你正确设定目标 让你的文化支持你 并进入这个世界

2130
03:22:03,275 --> 03:22:09,372
这是一个生物学上的转变 作为那个结果的后果 这意味着你身体内许多未被激活的部分被激活了

2131
03:22:10,213 --> 03:22:17,784
我猜一个问题会是 如果你激活了你内在所有能被激活的东西 你会变成什么样

2132
03:22:18,694 --> 03:22:20,001
嗯 这个目标不错

2133
03:22:20,001 --> 03:22:27,372
这是一个很好的发现 所以现在我要介绍一些其他的想法 所以

2134
03:22:27,412 --> 03:22:33,152
因此 荣格心理学中有一个叫做 "周游（绕行）"的概念 荣格曾说过

2135
03:22:33,252 --> 03:22:39,372
这个想法 你有一个潜在的未来自我 这将是潜在的

2136
03:22:39,492 --> 03:22:47,184
（是）你所能成为的一切 而它通过让你对事物产生兴趣 在你现在的生活中时刻显现自己

2137
03:22:48,052 --> 03:22:51,512
而你感兴趣的东西 将引导你沿着

2138
03:22:51,633 --> 03:22:53,769
引领你实现最大发展的道路

2139
03:22:54,453 --> 03:23:04,632
现在 这听起来像是一个形而上学的想法 甚至是一个神秘的想法 但它不是 它不是 它是一个真正深刻的生物学想法

2140
03:23:04,692 --> 03:23:13,892
这个想法就像 你的设定让你自动对那些能充分拓展你作为适应性强的生物的事物感兴趣

2141
03:23:14,173 --> 03:23:16,971
这个想法并不激进

2142
03:23:17,313 --> 03:23:23,032
除非你有什么根本性的缺陷 否则怎么可能是这种情况呢

2143
03:23:23,573 --> 03:23:29,592
情况就是这样 想想这种情况是如何在每时每刻体现出来的 还真有点意思

2144
03:23:29,672 --> 03:23:35,932
但我的想法是 你的兴趣会被那些引领你走上发展道路的事物所吸引

2145
03:23:36,895 --> 03:23:39,152
最好是这样 好吧 那就这样吧

2146
03:23:39,834 --> 03:23:44,551
因此 追求那些你感兴趣的东西是有一定作用的 这也是冒险的召唤

2147
03:23:44,551 --> 03:23:44,832
比方说

2148
03:23:46,196 --> 03:23:51,532
探险的召唤会把你带到各种各样的地方 而探险召唤的问题就在于 你到底要做什么

2149
03:23:52,955 --> 03:23:55,792
你可能会对那些反常的 变形的东西感兴趣

2150
03:23:57,013 --> 03:24:01,292
通常情况下 当人们的新部分显现出来并

2151
03:24:02,013 --> 03:24:05,732
吸引他们的兴趣时 他们做得非常糟糕和粗糙

2152
03:24:06,673 --> 03:24:12,492
所以 当你尝试做一些新事情时 你会像个傻瓜一样跌跌撞撞 这就是为什么傻瓜是救世主的前身

2153
03:24:13,014 --> 03:24:19,930
从象征性的角度来看 因为要想成为大师 你必须先成为傻瓜 如果你不愿意成为傻瓜 那么你就不可能成为大师 所以

2154
03:24:21,557 --> 03:24:25,532
因此 你将会发现这是一个错误百出的过程

2155
03:24:25,733 --> 03:24:30,832
这一点在《旧约》的故事中也有所体现 因为所有这些父权人物的第一件事就是

2156
03:24:31,575 --> 03:24:40,812
当他们像 80 40 岁时 上帝把他们赶出了他们父亲的家 因为他们会遇到各种各样的麻烦 有些是社会性的 有些是自然性的 有些是

2157
03:24:40,993 --> 03:24:42,852
这是他们自身道德不足的后果

2158
03:24:43,694 --> 03:24:51,372
所以他们是傻瓜 但有趣的是 尽管他们是傻瓜 他们仍然应该去探险 并且

2159
03:24:52,273 --> 03:24:59,232
他们有能力在探险过程中学习到足够的知识 从而在不同的时间和不同的环境中调整自己的心态

2160
03:25:00,254 --> 03:25:10,212
因此 荣格所谈到的这种周游就像是一种持续的回归 在某种意义上不断地环绕着那个你可能成为的人

2161
03:25:10,655 --> 03:25:13,272
例如 你可能会注意到你生活中的一些主题

2162
03:25:13,473 --> 03:25:19,672
当你回顾自己的经历时 你会发现自己有一些典型的经历 这些经历会重复出现 而且

2163
03:25:20,555 --> 03:25:22,992
可能会有一些变化 比如音乐主题

2164
03:25:23,173 --> 03:25:29,152
但这就像你在环绕自己 在穿越时空的过程中离自己越来越近

2165
03:25:29,674 --> 03:25:33,772
这就是 "绕行" 你先记住 因为我们会再讲的 好吗

2166
03:25:33,892 --> 03:25:37,552
想象一下 有什么东西在你面前闪过 那是一种兴趣

2167
03:25:37,652 --> 03:25:41,752
曙光乍现 你决定好了 首先你无力了 失去勇气了

2168
03:25:41,812 --> 03:25:47,512
你想 好吧 我怎么知道我是否应该继续 这可能是个愚蠢的想法 而正确的回答是 你是对的

2169
03:25:47,653 --> 03:25:52,611
这可能是个愚蠢的想法 因为几乎所有的想法都是愚蠢的 所以

2170
03:25:53,552 --> 03:25:59,112
当你在冒险中前进时 你第一次就能做对的概率为零

2171
03:25:59,915 --> 03:26:02,832
但这是不可能的 所以你可能会想

2172
03:26:03,033 --> 03:26:09,210
也许我会一直等下去 直到我有了正确的想法 哪些人做得对 所以他们就像 40 岁的 13 岁孩子一样

2173
03:26:10,132 --> 03:26:16,612
这不是一个好主意 所以他们一直在等待 直到《等待戈多》 直到他们最终得到了正确的答案

2174
03:26:16,793 --> 03:26:24,350
但问题是 你太笨了 不知道什么时候才是正确的 所以等待也无济于事 因为即使是绝佳的机会

2175
03:26:24,572 --> 03:26:31,172
如果它以不完整的形式出现在你面前 你就有可能将其视为绝佳的机会

2176
03:26:31,373 --> 03:26:36,812
你甚至可能认为这是你听过的最糟糕的想法 极有可能是

2177
03:26:37,513 --> 03:26:43,412
很有可能 所以你有尼采 尼采称之为愚蠢的意志

2178
03:26:44,034 --> 03:26:47,752
我真的很喜欢这一点 因为他认为这就是愚蠢

2179
03:26:48,756 --> 03:26:57,652
你必须从根本上考虑到这一点 并与之合作 这样 你就可以在你的人生道路上迈出这些试探性的一步

2180
03:26:58,395 --> 03:27:02,752
你可以假设你会做得很糟糕

2181
03:27:03,053 --> 03:27:10,352
这真的很有用 因为你不必自责 做不好很容易 但问题是做不好总比不做强

2182
03:27:10,392 --> 03:27:20,092
这也是《创世纪》中的历史故事一直回荡的信息

2183
03:27:20,192 --> 03:27:28,452
他们在暴政 饥荒和自我背叛中跌跌撞撞地走出去 并且暴力

2184
03:27:30,292 --> 03:27:39,092
但总比在家里自生自灭要好得多 这才是伟大的 这才是好的 为什么这样就可以了呢

2185
03:27:39,232 --> 03:27:46,948
所以 你开始了你的道路 你认为你正朝着你的星星前进 所以你朝那个方向走去

2186
03:27:48,694 --> 03:27:57,512
然后因为你在这里时 世界看起来是一个特定的样子 但当你移动到另一处时 世界看起来就不一样了 而你也因为这次旅行而变得不一样了

2187
03:27:57,713 --> 03:28:04,232
因此 这意味着 现在在你面前闪烁的东西已经转移了位置

2188
03:28:04,813 --> 03:28:10,892
因为你一开始就不善于指定 现在你比以前更敏锐 更专注了

2189
03:28:11,674 --> 03:28:17,412
它会更准确地向你展示自己 因此你必须

2190
03:28:19,417 --> 03:28:30,472
你知道 这几乎是一百八十度的大逆转 但其实并不是 因为你知道你已经你已经走了这么远 而且还有很长的路要走

2191
03:28:31,573 --> 03:28:37,192
但这比你呆在原地等待要好得多 远得多

2192
03:28:38,316 --> 03:28:42,301
因此 你可能会常常做得过火 但在并不重要

2193
03:28:43,275 --> 03:28:48,221
因为当你超额完成任务时 即使你没有学到你应该做的事情

2194
03:28:48,221 --> 03:28:51,792
你也会不断了解到哪些事情是不应该继续做的 哪些事情是不应该做的

2195
03:28:53,075 --> 03:28:55,750
如果你了解了足够多的不该继续做的事情 那么

2196
03:28:56,974 --> 03:29:02,412
这在某种程度上等同于同时学习你应该做什么 这样就没问题了

2197
03:29:03,856 --> 03:29:04,584
所以是这样的

2198
03:29:06,598 --> 03:29:07,772
现在它酷在哪里

2199
03:29:07,853 --> 03:29:16,132
我认为 随着你的进步 过火的程度开始下降 这一点我们是知道的

2200
03:29:16,412 --> 03:29:22,812
在你学习一项新技能时 比如说弹钢琴的例子 这里没有任何假设性的东西 你会疯狂地做过头 做过火

2201
03:29:23,013 --> 03:29:25,932
你一开始就犯了各种各样的错误 然后这些错误会渐渐消失

2202
03:29:30,499 --> 03:29:36,661
有一个很棒的 Ted 演讲 我想是关于这个人在他家安装了

2203
03:29:37,362 --> 03:29:43,102
一个非常先进的计算记录系统 记录下了他年幼孩子的每一句话

2204
03:29:43,983 --> 03:29:50,542
在学习说话的时候 然后他整理了孩子试图说出某些音素的尝试

2205
03:29:51,566 --> 03:29:58,362
并将它们列入列表 你可以听到孩子一开始偏离得很厉害 然后经过成百上千次的重复之后

2206
03:29:58,962 --> 03:30:03,762
就精确对准了确切的音素 所以你可能不知道这个

2207
03:30:03,923 --> 03:30:08,922
但是当孩子们胡言乱语 因为他们很小的时候就开始胡言乱语 他们会发出每一个人类音素

2208
03:30:09,864 --> 03:30:16,822
包括所有成人不能发出的各种音素 然后他们深入到他们的语言中 以至于

2209
03:30:17,805 --> 03:30:20,242
在他们学会了比如英语之后 有各种各样的音素

2210
03:30:20,343 --> 03:30:23,202
他们再也听不见或发不出来了 但最初 一切音素都在那里

2211
03:30:23,222 --> 03:30:28,718
这确实非常有趣 但是随着他们学习一种特定的语言

2212
03:30:28,718 --> 03:30:34,762
他们将发音的正确方法归零 并将错误降到最低 每次你都能学到东西

2213
03:30:34,983 --> 03:30:43,304
就是这样 知道这一点也非常有用 因为这意味着 在确定目的地之前 可以傻傻地四处游荡

2214
03:30:43,304 --> 03:30:45,891
现在你看到《出埃及记》中的呼应了吧

2215
03:30:45,891 --> 03:30:50,142
因为埃及人或希伯来人逃避暴政的结果是

2216
03:30:50,626 --> 03:31:00,771
这就像你从以前愚蠢的 无知的 固执的公理中解脱出来时 你个人和心理上所做的那样

2217
03:31:00,771 --> 03:31:02,156
这就像远离暴政一样

2218
03:31:02,156 --> 03:31:02,818
好极了

2219
03:31:02,818 --> 03:31:03,862
我从中解脱出来

2220
03:31:04,368 --> 03:31:04,955
然后呢

2221
03:31:05,925 --> 03:31:07,577
好吧 你想 好吧 现在我已经在路上了

2222
03:31:07,577 --> 03:31:08,222
不 你现在不是

2223
03:31:08,322 --> 03:31:15,182
你在沙漠中愚蠢地四处游荡 你知道并崇拜错误的东西

2224
03:31:15,743 --> 03:31:21,662
直到你最终重新在道德上组织自己 朝着正确的方向前进 这一点也值得了解 因为你认为

2225
03:31:22,723 --> 03:31:28,462
我甩掉了很多东西 甩掉了我生命中不需要的包袱 甩掉了多余的包袱 现在一切都好了

2226
03:31:29,042 --> 03:31:34,562
这并不是说你已经摆脱了一整套让你保持原位的脚手架 即使它们是病态的

2227
03:31:35,444 --> 03:31:44,002
现在 你一无所有 而一无所有实际上比病态的东西要好 但你仍然被一无所有的问题所困扰 而且

2228
03:31:44,983 --> 03:31:48,254
这就是为什么出埃及记的结构是这样的

2229
03:31:48,254 --> 03:31:50,220
是你从暴政中逃脱

2230
03:31:50,220 --> 03:31:50,782
万岁

2231
03:31:51,043 --> 03:31:52,167
我们不再是奴隶

2232
03:31:52,167 --> 03:31:56,722
是啊 现在你虚无主义了 迷失了 也未必是一种进步

2233
03:31:57,544 --> 03:32:04,302
但事实确实如此 你看 知道这一点也很有用 因为你也可能被误导认为

2234
03:32:05,003 --> 03:32:10,162
想象你正在试图成为一个开悟的人 这可能意味着激活你所有可以被激活的部分

2235
03:32:10,744 --> 03:32:13,192
你可能会认为 这只是一条线性向上的路径

2236
03:32:13,192 --> 03:32:15,420
这只是一个接一个的成功

2237
03:32:16,704 --> 03:32:21,102
这就是你所处的位置 你表现得还不错 （但也许）第一步就是彻头彻尾的灾难

2238
03:32:21,183 --> 03:32:24,222
情况变得更糟 然后也许你可以重新振作

2239
03:32:24,925 --> 03:32:29,722
然后你达到一个新的高原 然后那也开始崩溃和摇晃 砰的一声 情况再次变糟

2240
03:32:29,963 --> 03:32:35,042
所以部分原因是人们没有成为开悟者 是因为

2241
03:32:35,902 --> 03:32:41,162
这个过程被间歇性的灾难 本质上是间歇性的沙漠打断 如果你不知道这一点

2242
03:32:41,202 --> 03:32:47,282
那你基本上就完蛋了 在你崩溃时 你会认为继续前进是没用的

2243
03:32:47,444 --> 03:32:50,898
我崩溃了 但其实 不 这是正常过程的一部分

2244
03:32:51,908 --> 03:32:53,282
这并不表明你失败了

2245
03:32:53,464 --> 03:32:55,282
这只是表明这真的很难

2246
03:32:56,090 --> 03:32:57,282
当你学到东西的时候

2247
03:32:57,282 --> 03:32:58,757
你也会学到一些东西

2248
03:32:59,282 --> 03:33:02,777
你所学到的东西可能是有用的 而学不到它其实是很痛苦的

2249
03:33:03,282 --> 03:33:05,282
你知道 比方说如果你必须结束一段糟糕的关系

2250
03:33:05,706 --> 03:33:09,413
就像并不是每一段关系都有100%的坏处

2251
03:33:11,625 --> 03:33:16,393
所以 当你从里面跳出来的时候 也许你的状态会好一些 但你仍然是孤独的 迷失方向的

2252
03:33:17,302 --> 03:33:21,482
你不知道你的现在是什么 你也不知道你的未来是什么

2253
03:33:22,503 --> 03:33:24,269
这就是人们为什么会留在恶魔身边

2254
03:33:24,269 --> 03:33:26,738
（如果）他们知道的话 他们不会去寻找恶魔

2255
03:33:26,738 --> 03:33:37,766
（但）他们不知道 所以无论如何 你充满了缺点并不意味着你必须停下来 为此感谢上帝

2256
03:33:37,766 --> 03:33:43,402
这是一件非常有用的事情 虽然你有很多缺点 但这并不意味着你不能学习

2257
03:33:44,286 --> 03:33:47,562
因此 你可以提出一个理想 但你会错得离谱

2258
03:33:47,983 --> 03:33:53,862
但这并不重要 因为如果实际的理想没有很好地概念化 那么你正确的做法是

2259
03:33:56,512 --> 03:34:00,388
设想一个理想 并朝着它的方向发展 首先是 你要做什么

2260
03:34:00,388 --> 03:34:04,492
这是完美的 所以不完美并不重要

2261
03:34:04,573 --> 03:34:06,672
重要的是 你要去做 并勇往直前

2262
03:34:07,354 --> 03:34:12,992
因此 就我而言 这确实是个好消息 因为你可以做得很好 你可以做得很糟糕

2263
03:34:13,855 --> 03:34:23,292
任何人都能做到这一点 所以这很有用 好吧 如果你是一个高效的人 你就会这么做 但你不是 但谁在乎呢

2264
03:34:23,493 --> 03:34:34,372
你知道你最终还是会去同一个地方 也许这次旅行会更有趣 谁知道呢 也许太有趣了

2265
03:34:34,452 --> 03:34:41,862
他认为心理发展的目标是自我 而他所说的心理发展指的是精神发展

2266
03:34:42,883 --> 03:34:44,507
没有线性进化

2267
03:34:44,507 --> 03:34:47,415
只有对自我的环绕 对自我的靠近

2268
03:34:47,415 --> 03:34:49,842
这就像 就像你正在螺旋式上升

2269
03:34:51,423 --> 03:34:52,146
差不多就是这样

2270
03:34:52,146 --> 03:35:01,170
你所螺旋上升的东西会随着你的前进而后退 并随着你的前进而变得越来越复杂和发达

2271
03:35:01,170 --> 03:35:03,017
因为你不会没有目标 对吗

2272
03:35:03,017 --> 03:35:07,222
无论你有多努力 都有可能 毫无疑问

2273
03:35:08,464 --> 03:35:18,962
你可以在 30 个维度上更进一步 其中有些维度甚至是你在未雕琢的初始状态下无法想象的

2274
03:35:20,146 --> 03:35:22,435
均匀发展最多存在于开始时

2275
03:35:22,435 --> 03:35:24,222
后来 一切都指向中心

2276
03:35:24,383 --> 03:35:28,222
这种洞察力给了我稳定感 我的内心逐渐恢复了平静

2277
03:35:33,451 --> 03:35:35,194
所以这很有趣

2278
03:35:35,194 --> 03:35:37,237
左边是夏特尔大教堂

2279
03:35:37,237 --> 03:35:39,982
就是我跟你说过的那个有迷宫的地方

2280
03:35:40,603 --> 03:35:51,462
他们现在用激光点亮它 所以它就被激光点亮了 所以他们把它变成了一座光的大教堂 我认为这真的很迷人

2281
03:35:51,502 --> 03:35:59,134
这是同一种理念的延续 因为彩色玻璃窗显然不是原始的尝试

2282
03:35:59,134 --> 03:36:06,062
我的意思是 彩色玻璃窗给人留下了深刻印象 你知道 但这是对同一事物的阐述 所以现在你可以去那个大教堂了

2283
03:36:06,102 --> 03:36:11,322
他们就像这样照亮了整个小镇 这真的很了不起 大教堂就是这样建起来的

2284
03:36:11,484 --> 03:36:18,382
这是一个十字架 你还记得十字架是一个 X 标志着世界的中心 十字架是每个人

2285
03:36:18,542 --> 03:36:30,238
个人是 我认为这就是基督教的基本信息 十字架标志着每个人的位置 这是一个悲惨的地方 由痛苦和苦难组成

2286
03:36:30,843 --> 03:36:35,602
接触恶意 接受它是唯一的办法

2287
03:36:36,685 --> 03:36:40,842
在我看来 这句话一点也不形而上

2288
03:36:41,002 --> 03:36:47,262
这就好比 "X "标志着一个点 很公平 你在一个点上 你就在你世界的中心

2289
03:36:47,383 --> 03:36:51,021
在你们看来 它就在世界的中心 我们其他人也一样

2290
03:36:51,985 --> 03:36:55,801
毫无疑问 它的特点是苦难和遭受恶意

2291
03:36:56,343 --> 03:36:57,908
你打算怎么办

2292
03:36:57,908 --> 03:36:58,691
苦

2293
03:36:58,691 --> 03:36:59,574
怨恨

2294
03:36:59,574 --> 03:37:00,457
仇恨

2295
03:37:00,457 --> 03:37:01,681
这一切并没有让情况变得更糟

2296
03:37:02,708 --> 03:37:03,880
所以你必须接受它

2297
03:37:04,604 --> 03:37:10,721
现在看来 这并不是一件容易的事 因为实际上 我可以说 自愿接受自己的生存条件是一项英雄般的任务

2298
03:37:11,604 --> 03:37:13,291
而这一切都发生在十字架上

2299
03:37:13,291 --> 03:37:14,235
所以这很好

2300
03:37:14,235 --> 03:37:15,761
这与光有关

2301
03:37:16,202 --> 03:37:18,490
很好 这与光有关

2302
03:37:18,490 --> 03:37:21,801
你不会希望它与黑暗联系在一起 那将是一件坏事

2303
03:37:22,562 --> 03:37:34,370
所以 所以有 迷宫

2304
03:37:34,370 --> 03:37:35,011
它建于公元 1200 年

2305
03:37:36,672 --> 03:37:44,432
因此 我们的想法是 你走进这里 和我刚才向你展示的幻灯片的星形序列的想法是一样的

2306
03:37:44,552 --> 03:37:52,071
因此 这里的想法是 南北西东 就是整个世界的二维布局

2307
03:37:52,876 --> 03:37:54,972
那么问题来了 怎样才能到达中心呢

2308
03:37:55,073 --> 03:37:57,931
现在我们已经知道中心是什么了 中心就是十字架的中心

2309
03:37:58,473 --> 03:38:05,392
那是最大痛苦的地方 也可以说是最大恶意的地方 但那也是超越痛苦的地方

2310
03:38:05,513 --> 03:38:07,360
那么 如何到达那里呢

2311
03:38:07,360 --> 03:38:13,452
答案是 你不能只是站在外面看 那样于事无补

2312
03:38:14,434 --> 03:38:26,832
所以 即使你在加利福尼亚 你也不能直接跑到中心 所以你必须走进来 然后你看 你会这样走

2313
03:38:28,674 --> 03:38:37,692
你去到那个小宇宙上的每一个地方 每一个地方 然后一旦你去过每一个地方并且

2314
03:38:37,792 --> 03:38:46,172
由于向北 向西 向东 向南行进而扩展了自己 那么你就有足够的自我 以至于你能够忍受存在

2315
03:38:46,595 --> 03:38:54,392
首先 你能找出中心在哪里 而且你能容忍自己处于中心 这就是它所代表的意义

2316
03:38:54,894 --> 03:39:04,632
看 我的意思是 别搞错了 嘿 人们对这些想法非常认真 就像那是12世纪人们的一项了不起的工作

2317
03:39:04,953 --> 03:39:09,930
你知道 那些建造那些该死的大教堂花了300年 我们现在不建造任何需要300年才能完成的东西

2318
03:39:11,334 --> 03:39:14,912
你知道 人们把大量的努力投入到这些意味深长的事物中

2319
03:39:16,294 --> 03:39:19,592
你知道 如果你认为它们意味着天空中的有胡子的男人 那么你就知道了

2320
03:39:21,073 --> 03:39:31,291
在这种缺乏概念化的情况下 很难解释产生这些建筑的动机

2321
03:39:31,653 --> 03:39:40,291
要知道 各城镇 当然也包括沙特尔的城镇 都在为生产这些产品所需的税收负担而呻吟

2322
03:39:40,472 --> 03:39:44,472
现在 你可能会想 这在一定程度上是专制的 毫无疑问 情况确实如此

2323
03:39:44,713 --> 03:39:48,472
但这并不是故事的全部

2324
03:39:48,794 --> 03:39:53,083
整个故事就是 建造这些建筑的人对每一个细节都深思熟虑

2325
03:39:54,853 --> 03:40:00,649
没有什么是偶然的 他们试图描绘一些东西 就像那扇窗户试图描绘一些东西一样

2326
03:40:00,649 --> 03:40:08,251
它是万物显现的中心

2327
03:40:09,653 --> 03:40:18,352
被描绘成他内心的中心或中心 类似于脉轮和瑜伽练习中的脉轮

2328
03:40:19,194 --> 03:40:20,718
基本理念相同

2329
03:40:20,718 --> 03:40:25,852
这是内部结构的开放 也是正确的实现

2330
03:40:27,033 --> 03:40:34,061
所以 有人在走迷宫

2331
03:40:37,034 --> 03:40:38,762
这就是多种颜色的代码 对吗

2332
03:40:38,862 --> 03:40:48,501
正是这种与众不同的存在模式 让你在尽可能多的地方都能胜任 都能如鱼得水

2333
03:40:49,426 --> 03:40:52,061
这才是真正的个性差异化

2334
03:40:52,061 --> 03:41:04,013
这是一种突破 突破你的个性界限 包括你强加给自己的界限 成为一个在任何地方都有用的人

2335
03:41:04,013 --> 03:41:06,502
这也与约瑟的故事息息相关

2336
03:41:07,443 --> 03:41:12,122
因为发生在约瑟身上的一件事就是 他遭遇了很多糟糕的事情

2337
03:41:13,584 --> 03:41:16,122
因为他是父亲的宠儿 他的哥哥们都恨他

2338
03:41:16,948 --> 03:41:18,922
所以 他们首先要把他扔进坑里

2339
03:41:18,922 --> 03:41:23,482
我认为他们确实把他扔进了一个坑里 然后把他们卖掉做奴隶 最后他被关进了一个监狱

2340
03:41:24,266 --> 03:41:25,155
我们将通过故事

2341
03:41:26,304 --> 03:41:29,982
他最终去了一些你可能不想去的地方 监狱就是其中之一

2342
03:41:31,126 --> 03:41:35,242
但这并不重要 因为即使他们把他关进监狱

2343
03:41:36,306 --> 03:41:37,498
他其实并不在监狱里

2344
03:41:38,544 --> 03:41:42,802
他只是想出了如何让监狱更好地运转 然后他就控制了监狱

2345
03:41:43,586 --> 03:41:46,158
这真的很有趣

2346
03:41:46,158 --> 03:41:50,982
我有这么一个朋友 你知道的 他非常聪明 但也非常愤世嫉俗

2347
03:41:52,143 --> 03:41:58,742
他的工作并不怎么样 随着年龄的增长 鉴于他的智力水平和就业能力

2348
03:41:59,742 --> 03:42:02,862
他不得不接受一些智力挑战不大的工作

2349
03:42:03,884 --> 03:42:07,862
你知道 我试图说服他的一件事是 即使他工作

2350
03:42:08,926 --> 03:42:12,862
他想在汽车配件部门后面工作 因为他喜欢汽车

2351
03:42:13,365 --> 03:42:18,220
但那对他来说是低人一等的 你知道 因为在他看来 那是一份

2352
03:42:19,544 --> 03:42:22,982
对于他来说太简单的工作 实际上并非如此

2353
03:42:22,982 --> 03:42:25,462
他并不足够聪明去做那样的工作 或者他不够明智

2354
03:42:25,884 --> 03:42:30,342
但你知道 我试图告诉他的一件事是 你看待情况的方式不对

2355
03:42:31,403 --> 03:42:36,582
因为即使是在所谓的简单工作中 比如说餐馆洗碗工

2356
03:42:36,643 --> 03:42:38,642
我做了很多 它并不简单

2357
03:42:39,603 --> 03:42:43,555
你要和很多人打交道 人员转换非常快

2358
03:42:43,555 --> 03:42:45,842
你在为人们提供食物 你在帮助他们庆祝

2359
03:42:46,766 --> 03:42:53,642
你在帮助他们 休息一下 就像你能做得很好一样 然后厨房就能正常运作了

2360
03:42:53,905 --> 03:42:55,682
然后人们就可以来到餐厅

2361
03:42:55,742 --> 03:42:59,962
这并不是一个血腥的灾难 就像你在做一些事情时

2362
03:43:00,022 --> 03:43:08,813
你会认为它是一项卑微的工作 比如洗碗 有些做法真的很糟糕 充满怨恨和可怕 也有做得非常好的方式

2363
03:43:08,813 --> 03:43:11,600
只要你把它做得很好 它就不再是一份琐碎的工作了

2364
03:43:11,600 --> 03:43:13,906
它立即发生了变化

2365
03:43:13,906 --> 03:43:16,342
现在 我的意思是 你身边的人可能不会让这种事情发生

2366
03:43:17,724 --> 03:43:20,112
如果是这样的话 你应该去找另一份工作

2367
03:43:20,112 --> 03:43:22,581
但如果做得好 就一点也不琐碎

2368
03:43:24,065 --> 03:43:28,071
这也是摆脱怨恨的好办法

2369
03:43:28,071 --> 03:43:30,182
你会想 好吧 我只是得到了这份 你知道的 两点一线的工作

2370
03:43:30,303 --> 03:43:33,959
这就像 是啊 如果你做得尽可能好呢

2371
03:43:33,959 --> 03:43:34,622
你知道会发生什么吗

2372
03:43:34,842 --> 03:43:37,632
首先 你会变得更聪明

2373
03:43:37,632 --> 03:43:40,762
这是肯定的 但这并不是一件坏事

2374
03:43:42,944 --> 03:43:45,302
好的 所以这就是许多颜色的外衣

2375
03:43:46,083 --> 03:43:52,742
所以这是对约瑟性格的一种暗示 我们在所有这些宗法制度的人物中看到的是

2376
03:43:53,562 --> 03:43:58,654
不断的实现理想人物的过程 你可以把它想象成

2377
03:43:59,162 --> 03:44:06,502
连续的对理想人物的设想 故事探索了各种不同的可能性 包括一些非常暴力和灾难性的 恶意的情况

2378
03:44:07,122 --> 03:44:17,541
它试图覆盖整个领域 并聚焦于穿越迷宫 生活的迷宫 迷宫的正确方式

2379
03:44:18,922 --> 03:44:21,742
这里的提示是 你应该是多维的

2380
03:44:23,003 --> 03:44:24,648
这些是雅各的后代

2381
03:44:24,648 --> 03:44:31,871
约瑟十七岁时 与他的兄弟一同放羊 这个小伙子和他父亲的妻子们 比拉和悉帕的儿子们在一起

2382
03:44:31,871 --> 03:44:35,622
约瑟将他们的恶行报告给了他的父亲 ”

2383
03:44:36,446 --> 03:44:36,648
嗯

2384
03:44:38,384 --> 03:44:43,967
我们已经知道约瑟是雅各最喜欢的 所以这并没有让他在兄弟中很受欢迎

2385
03:44:43,967 --> 03:44:50,859
他年纪较轻 现在我们还发现 他或多或少地被设定为 你可能会说的一个告密者

2386
03:44:51,403 --> 03:44:56,622
因为这个短语的意思是 他出去监视他的哥哥们 如果他们做了不该做的事

2387
03:44:57,043 --> 03:45:00,917
然后他就跑回雅各那里报告

2388
03:45:00,917 --> 03:45:02,182
嗯 这不会让你受欢迎

2389
03:45:03,243 --> 03:45:09,452
那么 你会说这是约瑟的问题还是雅各布的问题

2390
03:45:10,354 --> 03:45:14,972
我想说的是 这也是我在阅读荣格时学到的 这是一个阴谋论的问题

2391
03:45:15,853 --> 03:45:21,710
没错 父母有错 但同意这样做的孩子也有错

2392
03:45:21,710 --> 03:45:29,532
他们有一个小阴谋集团 你可能会说这只是父母的错

2393
03:45:29,652 --> 03:45:34,632
但儿子会利用每一个为他提供的优势 因为他本可以说不

2394
03:45:34,892 --> 03:45:41,972
无论如何 约瑟是我的最爱 他有点像老师

2395
03:45:42,153 --> 03:45:46,832
以色列爱约瑟胜过爱他所有的孩子

2396
03:45:46,933 --> 03:45:49,732
因为他是他晚年时最小的儿子 他给他做了一件五颜六色的外衣

2397
03:45:51,254 --> 03:45:56,412
当他的弟兄们看到他们的父亲爱他胜过爱所有的弟兄时 他们就恨他 无法与他和睦相处

2398
03:45:56,934 --> 03:46:01,132
比方说 你有一个或多个孩子 其中一个是你的最爱

2399
03:46:01,213 --> 03:46:02,607
你应该如何对待那个孩子

2400
03:46:03,634 --> 03:46:08,572
好吧 你公开地让他们成为你的最爱 这并不明显是对他们有任何好处

2401
03:46:09,518 --> 03:46:10,412
首先

2402
03:46:10,793 --> 03:46:16,452
也许你没有像你应该的那样多挑战他们 首先 你绝对是在建立一个类似该隐和亚伯的家庭情景

2403
03:46:16,713 --> 03:46:27,449
或者也许这是一种俄狄浦斯情结 因为你碰巧比爱你的配偶更爱你的孩子 这并不是家庭和谐的秘诀 所以

2404
03:46:30,016 --> 03:46:36,832
这似乎不是个好主意 所以现在我们有两个原因说明约瑟不被他的兄弟们喜欢

2405
03:46:38,294 --> 03:46:42,532
一个是他有点小气 另一个是他是最受宠的人

2406
03:46:42,673 --> 03:46:47,832
他的弟兄们看到他们的父亲爱他胜过一切时

2407
03:46:47,912 --> 03:46:52,972
他的弟兄们比他所有的弟兄们都恨他 不能与他和睦相处

2408
03:46:54,333 --> 03:46:59,172
约瑟做了一个梦 他把梦告诉了他的弟兄们 他们就更恨他了

2409
03:47:01,499 --> 03:47:09,412
他对他们说 我在这里向你们祈求我所做的这个梦 因为我们正在田里捆麦穗

2410
03:47:10,135 --> 03:47:13,472
看哪 你们的禾捆围着我的禾捆站着 向我的禾捆鞠躬

2411
03:47:17,513 --> 03:47:22,452
别忘了他还年轻 而且还是宠妃的女儿

2412
03:47:22,714 --> 03:47:24,892
这也是宠妻之子的另一个特点

2413
03:47:25,033 --> 03:47:32,872
他的弟兄们对他说 你真的能统治我们吗 你真的能统治我们吗

2414
03:47:33,614 --> 03:47:36,932
他们因为他的梦想和他的话而更加憎恨他

2415
03:47:37,012 --> 03:47:42,172
这种震惊是完全有道理的 所以当情况变得更糟时 你会看到这里

2416
03:47:42,672 --> 03:47:47,669
好了 麦穗在那里低头 然后你看到这个

2417
03:47:47,669 --> 03:47:48,512
这是怎么回事

2418
03:47:48,693 --> 03:47:51,992
不过 他的 "自大 "还不止于此

2419
03:47:53,692 --> 03:47:59,732
而且 在旧约中 特别是在约瑟的故事中 有这样一个观点 如果上帝两次托梦给你 他真的是认真的

2420
03:48:00,453 --> 03:48:03,992
所以 我不知道这是否真的 虽然我确实知道人们会有重复的梦

2421
03:48:05,013 --> 03:48:10,232
重复出现的梦可能真的是在试图强调某件事

2422
03:48:10,393 --> 03:48:13,492
你知道 经常出现的噩梦肯定是有意义的

2423
03:48:14,112 --> 03:48:16,132
而且经常出现的噩梦

2424
03:48:16,952 --> 03:48:25,906
与心理健康状态的下降紧密相关 如果你能治疗噩梦--这通常相当容易--

2425
03:48:27,513 --> 03:48:32,432
那么一些心理健康问题会减少 所以重复的梦似乎无论如何都是重要的

2426
03:48:32,854 --> 03:48:36,206
他又做了一个梦 把这个梦告诉了他的弟兄们 并说 看哪

2427
03:48:36,206 --> 03:48:37,912
我又做了一个梦

2428
03:48:37,992 --> 03:48:45,329
看哪 太阳 月亮和十一颗星星都向我叩拜 他就把这事告诉了他的父亲和兄弟

2429
03:48:45,472 --> 03:48:49,611
他的父亲斥责他 并对他说 你做的是什么梦

2430
03:48:49,752 --> 03:48:56,117
难道我和你母亲及你的兄弟们真的要来向你俯首称臣 向地面鞠躬吗

2431
03:48:57,392 --> 03:49:05,829
他的兄弟们嫉妒他 但他的父亲注意到了这些 那么 如果有人告诉你这样的事 你该怎么理解呢 对吧

2432
03:49:06,876 --> 03:49:09,412
这就像 他们对自己的梦负责吗

2433
03:49:11,074 --> 03:49:14,752
我们似乎真的不认为我们对自己的梦负责

2434
03:49:14,872 --> 03:49:19,712
我们晚上做的梦 那么你对梦的看法是什么呢 就像是荣格指出的那样

2435
03:49:19,913 --> 03:49:22,163
这是他与弗洛伊德有很大不同之处

2436
03:49:22,163 --> 03:49:24,312
弗洛伊德倾向于认为梦隐藏了其含义

2437
03:49:25,515 --> 03:49:32,909
因为其内容对意识心智来说是不可接受的 而荣格说不 你不明白

2438
03:49:32,909 --> 03:49:40,072
情况不是这样的 情况是梦尽其所能地表达一些人还不真正知道的东西

2439
03:49:40,774 --> 03:49:43,525
荣格认为梦是自然的一种表现

2440
03:49:43,525 --> 03:49:45,172
它根本与自我无关

2441
03:49:45,314 --> 03:49:52,532
就像你做了一个梦 梦里发生了一些事情 就像你走进晚宴一样 那里也发生了一些事情

2442
03:49:53,097 --> 03:49:58,552
你知道这不是梦 梦不是你的操纵能力所能左右的

2443
03:49:58,652 --> 03:50:03,912
这是发生在你身上的事 而不是你做的事 所以如果有人做了这样的梦

2444
03:50:04,053 --> 03:50:05,660
你有三个选择

2445
03:50:05,660 --> 03:50:12,212
你可以对梦全盘否定 而这正是现代人倾向于做的事 这是一个非常糟糕的想法 因为

2446
03:50:13,093 --> 03:50:15,469
产生的这些想法 你不应该忽视它们

2447
03:50:15,469 --> 03:50:19,351
你知道 我的意思是 它们并不像某些神经科学家所说的那样是随机的

2448
03:50:19,351 --> 03:50:26,112
如果是随机的 那就像电视机上的雪花一样 是绝对荒谬的理论

2449
03:50:27,035 --> 03:50:35,509
所以 第一种情况是你对梦不屑一顾 第二种情况是你认为这个人是个骗子 吹牛者和自恋者 第三种情况是

2450
03:50:36,933 --> 03:50:37,977
那么 第三个是什么

2451
03:50:37,977 --> 03:50:42,332
他好像梦见日月星辰向他俯首称臣

2452
03:50:44,357 --> 03:50:45,872
你可以考虑两三次

2453
03:50:46,955 --> 03:50:49,632
所以 但这不一定是会让你快乐的事情

2454
03:50:50,894 --> 03:50:55,432
他的兄弟们去喂父亲的在示剑的羊群 所以他们离开了 以色列对约瑟说

2455
03:50:56,295 --> 03:51:00,812
难道你的兄弟不是在示剑喂羊吗 来吧 你去找他们吧

2456
03:51:02,076 --> 03:51:03,632
约瑟过去 朝兄弟们打招呼 我在这儿

2457
03:51:04,854 --> 03:51:10,212
他们远远看见他之前 就在他还没有走近他们之前 他们就密谋要杀死他

2458
03:51:12,053 --> 03:51:16,932
那时的人真粗暴 对吧 这种事情相当频繁地发生

2459
03:51:19,675 --> 03:51:28,132
他们彼此说 看 那做梦的来了 来吧 我们现在就杀了他 把他扔进某个坑里

2460
03:51:28,353 --> 03:51:33,052
我们就说有恶兽吞噬了他 我们就看看他的梦是不是真的

2461
03:51:33,153 --> 03:51:36,192
那里显然有该隐和亚伯故事的回音 你知道我的意思

2462
03:51:38,780 --> 03:51:47,212
这不像该隐和亚伯的故事那么清晰 因为在该隐和亚伯的故事中 亚伯显然只是做得很好 而这里你无法完全掌握约瑟的性格

2463
03:51:47,333 --> 03:51:56,832
你无法判断他是否真的是被选中的 或者他只是一个有着妄想的被宠坏的孩子 你知道 但这并不重要 因为他的兄弟们

2464
03:51:57,013 --> 03:52:08,752
对他如此被偏爱这个事实感到恼怒 甚至可能是他可能是注定要做不一般的事情的人这个事实

2465
03:52:08,832 --> 03:52:20,432
他们觉得完全合理地摧毁那个事实 这是如此奇怪 如此有趣 这种拉下理想的主题在这些古老的故事中多么频繁地表现出来

2466
03:52:20,593 --> 03:52:26,012
没错 该隐和亚伯的故事所建立的模式不断重复 重复 再重复

2467
03:52:26,113 --> 03:52:27,492
我认为这是千真万确的

2468
03:52:27,612 --> 03:52:32,792
我认为这只是在不断重复 好让人们为自己的生活多么悲惨而苦恼

2469
03:52:33,355 --> 03:52:35,812
他们恼怒自己受到恶意的伤害

2470
03:52:36,394 --> 03:52:43,292
他们对自己做得不如别人好感到恼火 这使他们陷入了这种状态

2471
03:52:43,392 --> 03:52:49,732
如果你因为现代人的怨恨而去杀人 也许现代人会有这样的想法

2472
03:52:50,014 --> 03:52:52,172
你一般不会杀了他们 然后把他们扔进坑里

2473
03:52:52,693 --> 03:52:58,752
你知道 你要做的就是在几十年里慢慢地杀死他们 但我不认为这样做会更好

2474
03:52:59,677 --> 03:52:59,840
所以

2475
03:53:01,335 --> 03:53:04,092
我见过很多处于这种情况的已婚夫妇

2476
03:53:05,133 --> 03:53:09,727
这就像 这就像 是啊 有这样的米奇赫德伯格

2477
03:53:09,727 --> 03:53:11,412
他曾经抱怨过高领毛衣

2478
03:53:11,533 --> 03:53:14,692
他说就像被一个非常弱小的侏儒掐住脖子一样

2479
03:53:15,454 --> 03:53:21,746
这可能是一个政治上不正确的笑话 但却是一个有趣的笑话

2480
03:53:24,852 --> 03:53:28,891
然后你就会看到这样的人际关系

2481
03:53:29,012 --> 03:53:34,685
就好像每个人的手都掐在对方的脖子上 却没有足够的勇气去真正捏一下

2482
03:53:35,752 --> 03:53:44,852
他们只是施加足够的压力 一点点切断血液循环 所以人就会像这样 在30年的时间里死去 诸如此类

2483
03:53:45,834 --> 03:53:50,370
你们都笑了 因为你们知道这是真的

2484
03:53:50,370 --> 03:53:50,772
这就是原因

2485
03:53:54,074 --> 03:53:57,732
我们会说他被某种邪恶的野兽吞食了 这其实是真的

2486
03:53:58,093 --> 03:54:03,332
这将是兄弟俩体内的邪恶野兽 我们将看到他的梦想会变成什么样子

2487
03:54:03,874 --> 03:54:06,292
哈哈 这也很有趣 因为

2488
03:54:06,292 --> 03:54:12,212
因为 所以 他们想报复自己 因为也许约瑟很特别

2489
03:54:12,312 --> 03:54:19,032
然后他们就想报复父亲 这可能不是最明智的想法 因为他们欠父亲一些恩情

2490
03:54:19,494 --> 03:54:24,206
我的意思是 也许他的行为像个讨厌鬼 这有一定的证据 但这有点苛刻

2491
03:54:24,792 --> 03:54:27,468
但他们也想怨恨上帝 就像该隐一样

2492
03:54:28,132 --> 03:54:32,489
因为这就意味着 我们将拭目以待他的梦想会变成什么样子

2493
03:54:33,312 --> 03:54:38,692
因为从某种意义上说 一旦你试图对抗直觉

2494
03:54:38,813 --> 03:54:43,542
如果你想用某个人的直觉 某个人的自然直觉来对抗"存在"本身的结构 那你就把自己摆在了"存在"本身的对立面

2495
03:54:44,492 --> 03:54:46,565
所以 非常糟糕

2496
03:54:47,652 --> 03:54:51,302
流便听见了 就把他从他们手中解救出来 说："不 我们不要杀他

2497
03:54:51,812 --> 03:54:56,042
流便对他们说 不要流血 把他扔到旷野的坑里去吧

2498
03:54:56,532 --> 03:54:58,380
就像在这个故事中 流便是好人

2499
03:55:00,992 --> 03:55:02,491
顺便说一下 坑里没有水

2500
03:55:02,532 --> 03:55:08,197
不要对他下手 他打算将他从他们手中救出 再交还给他的父亲 ”

2501
03:55:10,612 --> 03:55:12,387
所以流便实际上是想救他

2502
03:55:13,655 --> 03:55:16,889
说 他打算将他从他们手中救出 再交还给他的父亲

2503
03:55:17,652 --> 03:55:23,904
约瑟到了他的弟兄那里 他们就剥下他的外衣 就是他身上的多色外衣

2504
03:55:25,812 --> 03:55:29,153
他们把他扔进坑里 坑是空的 里面没有水

2505
03:55:34,282 --> 03:55:42,600
他们坐下吃饼 举目观看 一队以实玛利人从基列来了 骆驼上驮着香料 香膏和没药

2506
03:55:43,202 --> 03:55:44,440
要把它带到埃及去

2507
03:55:44,562 --> 03:55:50,007
犹太对他的弟兄们说："我们杀了自己的兄弟 却隐瞒他的血 这对我们有什么益处呢 "

2508
03:55:51,282 --> 03:55:53,054
所以 他是这里最实际的人

2509
03:55:54,122 --> 03:55:55,896
我们可以卖掉他 为什么还要杀他

2510
03:55:56,602 --> 03:56:04,122
这就像 来吧 让我们把他卖给以实玛利人 不要让我们的手在他身上 因为他是我们的兄弟 我们的肉体 他的弟兄已经满足了

2511
03:56:05,327 --> 03:56:12,742
然后 他们经过米甸人的商船 他们把约瑟从坑里拉上来 用二十两银子把约瑟卖给了以实玛利人

2512
03:56:13,744 --> 03:56:18,962
他们将约瑟带入埃及

2513
03:56:19,263 --> 03:56:22,357
我一直不清楚这些奴隶制故事是如何发生的

2514
03:56:22,357 --> 03:56:28,722
这就好比是 2500 3000 年前 我决定把你卖给以实玛利人 结果就这么定了

2515
03:56:28,803 --> 03:56:33,770
我拿到了钱 你却成了奴隶 然后他们把你带走 我真不明白这是怎么回事

2516
03:56:33,770 --> 03:56:41,342
我不明白人们为什么不总是互相出卖 但也许如果你们是一家人 你就可以做到

2517
03:56:46,151 --> 03:56:56,182
于是他们将约瑟卖了 流便回到坑边 看见约瑟不在那里 流便撕裂了自己的衣服 所以流便对此非常沮丧

2518
03:56:56,262 --> 03:57:00,201
他回到他兄弟们那里 说孩子不在了 我该怎么办呢

2519
03:57:01,406 --> 03:57:06,442
他们合谋拿了约瑟的外衣 杀了一只山羊的羊羔 把外衣浸在血里

2520
03:57:06,985 --> 03:57:09,422
这也很有趣 因为血液其实是另一种颜色

2521
03:57:10,564 --> 03:57:14,682
没错 他的外衣有很多颜色 血肯定是一种颜色

2522
03:57:15,305 --> 03:57:19,562
因此 从某种意义上说 约瑟的外衣上多了血的颜色

2523
03:57:20,367 --> 03:57:23,022
我想说 这可能是一种必要的颜色

2524
03:57:24,183 --> 03:57:29,462
因为我认为 在你的外衣沾满鲜血之前 你还不够严肃

2525
03:57:30,845 --> 03:57:33,521
他们把那件五颜六色的大衣送给了父亲

2526
03:57:34,903 --> 03:57:36,673
他说 所以他们骗了他

2527
03:57:36,673 --> 03:57:38,322
这是非常非常肮脏的事情

2528
03:57:39,766 --> 03:57:41,372
他们把他的儿子卖为奴隶

2529
03:57:41,372 --> 03:57:43,119
他们声称他已经死了

2530
03:57:43,119 --> 03:57:43,802
他们骗了他

2531
03:57:44,685 --> 03:57:47,062
这让他陷入了极度的悲痛之中

2532
03:57:47,923 --> 03:57:50,250
这背后有很多仇恨 对吗

2533
03:57:50,250 --> 03:57:54,762
对约瑟和雅各布的巨大仇恨

2534
03:57:56,628 --> 03:58:00,682
我们找到了这件衣服 现在知道它是不是你儿子的外套了

2535
03:58:00,883 --> 03:58:03,982
他说这是我儿子的外衣 一只邪恶的野兽吞噬了他

2536
03:58:05,323 --> 03:58:11,722
毫无疑问 约瑟被撕成碎片 雅各撕破衣服 披上麻布 哀悼多日

2537
03:58:11,822 --> 03:58:18,812
他的儿子和女儿们起来安慰他 但他拒绝接受安慰 他说我要为我的儿子守丧入土

2538
03:58:20,162 --> 03:58:27,572
因此 他的父亲为他哭泣 这就是雅各听到消息后的崩溃

2539
03:58:33,356 --> 03:58:40,722
米甸人把约瑟卖到埃及 卖给法老的官长和卫队长波提乏 约瑟就被带到埃及

2540
03:58:40,922 --> 03:58:47,622
波提乏是法老的官 是卫队长 是埃及人 他从把他带到这里来的以实玛利人手中买下了他

2541
03:58:48,449 --> 03:58:49,661
所以现在他是个奴隶

2542
03:58:51,626 --> 03:58:59,682
所以现在你会想 那就是 这个人有很多理由对现实的结构感到恼怒 对吗

2543
03:58:59,782 --> 03:59:03,836
他从最受欢迎的人变成了被所有兄弟背叛的人

2544
03:59:03,836 --> 03:59:10,782
这是相当粗暴的 然后他被变成了奴隶 现在他被卖去当奴隶了

2545
03:59:10,963 --> 03:59:16,782
所以你认为这会败坏他的人品 因为你知道 我认为无论如何这都是一个问题

2546
03:59:17,124 --> 03:59:20,582
我认为 人们总是在为自己的人格堕落寻找借口

2547
03:59:21,183 --> 03:59:25,842
因为如果你的角色堕落了 你就会撒谎 欺骗 偷窃和背叛

2548
03:59:25,922 --> 03:59:29,342
你可以愤愤不平 你可以无所事事 这一切都很简单

2549
03:59:30,023 --> 03:59:31,732
撒谎比说实话更容易

2550
03:59:31,732 --> 03:59:33,522
无所作为比有所作为更容易

2551
03:59:33,926 --> 03:59:35,482
所以 总有一部分人会想

2552
03:59:36,043 --> 03:59:42,202
好吧 我需要一个理由来证明自己的无用和可怕 因为那会减少很多工作 所以

2553
03:59:43,424 --> 03:59:46,382
然后 如果有可怕的事情发生 你就会想 啊哈！

2554
03:59:46,904 --> 03:59:51,482
这正是我一直在等待的借口 然后一切都出来了

2555
03:59:53,527 --> 03:59:59,122
要知道 索尔仁尼琴在俄罗斯集中营时 曾观察过人们的行为

2556
04:00:00,146 --> 04:00:04,962
他说 有些人被关进集中营后 马上就成了托管人或警卫

2557
04:00:05,103 --> 04:00:09,562
他们甚至比被雇来当卫兵的人还要凶狠 他的想法是

2558
04:00:10,726 --> 04:00:11,898
他们收集了所有

2559
04:00:13,268 --> 04:00:18,802
如果我没记错的话 他把这叫做 "污秽"

2560
04:00:19,684 --> 04:00:24,362
但他们没有机会表达出来 但只要你给他们机会 他们就会表现出来

2561
04:00:24,463 --> 04:00:33,122
这是立即发生的 所以旧约故事似乎回响着的一个信息是

2562
04:00:34,684 --> 04:00:38,082
仅仅因为你遭遇了可怕的事情 并不意味着你就有权偏离正道

2563
04:00:39,584 --> 04:00:43,182
让事情变得更糟

2564
04:00:44,224 --> 04:00:47,582
也许无论发生在你身上的事情有多么可怕 都不重要

2565
04:00:48,823 --> 04:00:54,040
这是个艰难的决定 你知道 因为你会看到生活中时不时有一些人 他们真的很艰难

2566
04:00:54,723 --> 04:01:00,222
就好像50件糟糕的事情同时降临到他们身上 你会觉得 如果你痛苦 怨恨 敌对 那就不足为奇了

2567
04:01:00,723 --> 04:01:05,782
索尔仁尼琴在《古拉格群岛》中再次谈到了这一点

2568
04:01:05,843 --> 04:01:08,062
他说他在集中营系统中遇到了很多人 并不是很多

2569
04:01:08,583 --> 04:01:15,202
他遇到了足够多的人 给他留下了深刻印象 这些人没有让自己的不幸腐化他们

2570
04:01:16,264 --> 04:01:20,602
这很重要 因为也许唯一真正的不幸就是变得腐化

2571
04:01:21,727 --> 04:01:23,697
这是一个非常有用的思考

2572
04:01:23,697 --> 04:01:24,742
你知道 也许其他的

2573
04:01:26,005 --> 04:01:28,022
也许其他的与之相比显得微不足道

2574
04:01:28,143 --> 04:01:31,722
我知道这是一件很艰难的事情 因为你可能处于非常恶劣的环境中

2575
04:01:31,823 --> 04:01:35,722
但我确实认为这有其道理 上帝与约瑟同在

2576
04:01:35,863 --> 04:01:40,902
他是个富足的人 在他主人埃及人的家里

2577
04:01:41,003 --> 04:01:43,562
与他同在 上帝让他所做的一切在他手中兴旺发达

2578
04:01:43,944 --> 04:01:47,602
这与我们之前提到的 "与上帝同行 "的理念不谋而合 对吗

2579
04:01:48,064 --> 04:01:52,922
所以亚当在和夏娃一起吃果子之前 先与上帝同行 然后他就不与上帝同行了 而且

2580
04:01:53,784 --> 04:01:57,480
然后诺亚与神同行 亚伯拉罕与神同行 所以这个想法很好

2581
04:01:57,962 --> 04:02:00,133
这就是向最高理想看齐

2582
04:02:00,133 --> 04:02:02,002
我想是这样的 你知道

2583
04:02:02,945 --> 04:02:05,302
我们也可以将其视为一种形而上学的主张

2584
04:02:06,425 --> 04:02:16,282
但我不这么认为 我的意思是 去年我收到了成千上万封来信 都是一些人告诉我 他们被困在一个坑里

2585
04:02:17,948 --> 04:02:28,962
没错 他们决定要重新开始生活 并且成功了

2586
04:02:29,224 --> 04:02:35,602
你知道 他们感到惊讶 就像是 我决定我要努力做好我的工作 我不会再撒谎了

2587
04:02:35,763 --> 04:02:43,842
除非绝对必要 我想我会试一试几个月 你知道 然后所有好事开始发生在我身上 就像

2588
04:02:43,942 --> 04:02:49,642
也许这就是世界的运作方式 显然它不总是这样运作的 对吧 因为你可能会被砍断膝盖

2589
04:02:49,923 --> 04:02:52,613
我的意思是 存在的一个元素就是“任意”

2590
04:02:52,613 --> 04:03:03,282
那是你没有可能消除的 但这并不意味着没有不好的策略和好的策略

2591
04:03:04,685 --> 04:03:12,642
所以我确实认为 最根本的存在性问题之一是 如果你的生活中事情进展不顺利

2592
04:03:12,803 --> 04:03:16,422
你是否绝对确定你正在竭尽全力把事情安排妥当

2593
04:03:17,263 --> 04:03:21,662
因为如果你不是 那么你就不应该抱怨 因为你不知道你实际上

2594
04:03:22,422 --> 04:03:25,142
在多大程度上助长甚至造成现在的情况

2595
04:03:25,222 --> 04:03:28,482
这种想法非常令人讨厌 我并不想责怪受害者

2596
04:03:28,824 --> 04:03:31,922
你知道 我知道人们最终患上肺癌是因为他们接触了石棉

2597
04:03:32,545 --> 04:03:34,802
你知道我并不想

2598
04:03:34,922 --> 04:03:39,442
我还知道 如果你因为接触石棉而患上肺癌 这可能会对你的健康造成严重影响

2599
04:03:39,603 --> 04:03:43,082
但悲剧或地狱 在某种程度上取决于你的行为方式

2600
04:03:44,205 --> 04:03:47,522
所以我知道这是很悲观的可能性 但

2601
04:03:49,565 --> 04:03:51,982
总之 约瑟是个奴隶 但事实证明

2602
04:03:54,785 --> 04:03:58,002
他没有牺牲他性格的正直 所以结果是 他

2603
04:03:59,227 --> 04:04:00,439
结果是他不是一个奴隶

2604
04:04:01,645 --> 04:04:03,033
只是他周围的每个人都认为

2605
04:04:03,033 --> 04:04:04,402
他是奴隶 但他不是

2606
04:04:05,466 --> 04:04:06,618
所以这挺有趣的

2607
04:04:08,384 --> 04:04:10,134
他是一个仪表堂堂 受人喜爱的人

2608
04:04:10,134 --> 04:04:14,741
他是个好人 也是个令人印象深刻的标本

2609
04:04:15,725 --> 04:04:18,602
考虑到当前的政治气候 这相当有趣

2610
04:04:18,642 --> 04:04:24,162
可以说 在这些事情之后 他的主人的妻子对约瑟投以目光

2611
04:04:24,242 --> 04:04:28,962
她说 与我同寝 这实际上有两层意思 对吧

2612
04:04:30,622 --> 04:04:38,812
但他拒绝了 并对他主人的妻子说 看哪

2613
04:04:40,698 --> 04:04:45,432
我的主人现在不会知道我在家中在做什么 （也就是说）他把所有的都交在我的手上

2614
04:04:47,296 --> 04:04:55,002
你是他的妻子 除了你 在这家里没有人比我地位更高 他把所有的都留在家里让我看管

2615
04:04:55,002 --> 04:04:56,672
我怎能做这大恶

2616
04:04:57,513 --> 04:05:07,282
做这大恶 得罪上帝 她日复一日对约瑟说话 他不听从她

2617
04:05:07,985 --> 04:05:10,742
她想让约瑟与她同寝或与她同在 约瑟遭到了性骚扰

2618
04:05:11,442 --> 04:05:16,522
事情就是这样 我的意思是 看看这幅画

2619
04:05:23,162 --> 04:05:28,942
大约在这个时候 约瑟进屋办事 屋内没有一个男人

2620
04:05:30,163 --> 04:05:32,461
她抓住他的衣服 说 与我同寝

2621
04:05:33,203 --> 04:05:36,241
他把衣服留在她手中逃跑了

2622
04:05:37,083 --> 04:05:40,461
所以 这对可怜的约瑟来说有点尴尬 我会说

2623
04:05:41,043 --> 04:05:43,241
而且有点可疑

2624
04:05:43,643 --> 04:05:47,982
当她看到他把衣服留在她手中逃走时

2625
04:05:48,344 --> 04:05:50,962
她召唤了她家的仆人们 对他们说

2626
04:05:51,183 --> 04:05:54,051
看 他引进了一个希伯来人来嘲笑我们

2627
04:05:54,051 --> 04:05:57,981
他来我这里要与我同寝 我就大声呼救

2628
04:06:00,187 --> 04:06:00,668
这是什么

2629
04:06:00,668 --> 04:06:03,135
女人被轻视时 地狱也无法匹敌

2630
04:06:03,135 --> 04:06:06,002
这就是对此的恰当评论

2631
04:06:06,202 --> 04:06:11,881
他听到我高声呼喊 就把衣服留给了我 自己逃走了

2632
04:06:13,349 --> 04:06:15,762
当他的主人听到他妻子的话后

2633
04:06:16,083 --> 04:06:20,822
她对法老说 你的仆人是这样对我的

2634
04:06:21,744 --> 04:06:26,922
国王的怒火被点燃了 约瑟的主人把他关进了监狱 那里是关押国王囚犯的地方

2635
04:06:27,404 --> 04:06:30,255
他被绑在监狱里

2636
04:06:30,255 --> 04:06:31,561
这有点糟糕

2637
04:06:31,561 --> 04:06:31,842
这就像

2638
04:06:33,344 --> 04:06:36,302
先是他的兄弟们背叛了他 把他扔进坑里

2639
04:06:37,025 --> 04:06:39,642
然后他又沦为奴隶 这可能比被关进地牢好些

2640
04:06:39,843 --> 04:06:45,222
然后 他就成了国王的奴隶 所以效果还不错 现在又有人在他身上撒了谎

2641
04:06:45,262 --> 04:06:49,782
他又被出卖了 现在又和他一起进了监狱 所以又是这样 对吧

2642
04:06:50,063 --> 04:06:50,967
都是一样的

2643
04:06:50,967 --> 04:06:56,377
这就像西西弗斯推着石头上坡 然后又下来 就是秩序与混沌

2644
04:06:57,043 --> 04:07:03,422
秩序与混沌 你必须思考 你是秩序吗 你是混沌吗 还是在它们之间移动的东西

2645
04:07:04,245 --> 04:07:05,861
因为这是正确的做法

2646
04:07:06,666 --> 04:07:14,121
否则 你就只能是有序的 这不是个好主意 或者你只能是混乱的 这也不是个好主意

2647
04:07:14,643 --> 04:07:20,322
在他们之间进行调解 这就是他所做的 但主与约瑟同在

2648
04:07:20,402 --> 04:07:23,702
向他施怜悯 使他在狱长眼前蒙恩

2649
04:07:24,425 --> 04:07:32,602
我觉得这不是件容易的事 就像你被关进监狱 现在狱卒又喜欢你 你到底该怎么做

2650
04:07:32,602 --> 04:07:37,282
但这是一个值得思考的问题 因为你可能会想 如果你真的处于水深火热之中

2651
04:07:37,463 --> 04:07:42,842
你应该如何自处 才能获得最大的成功几率

2652
04:07:42,862 --> 04:07:50,602
这并不是说 嗯 约瑟接管了拇指螺丝刑具 你知道的 并开始对其他囚犯使用

2653
04:07:50,682 --> 04:07:51,808
这根本不是这里的指示

2654
04:07:51,808 --> 04:07:53,498
而是说 是他在做事

2655
04:07:53,498 --> 04:07:56,595
即使他在监狱里 他表现得不像是个囚犯

2656
04:07:57,904 --> 04:08:01,561
就像他在当奴隶时表现得不像是个奴隶一样

2657
04:08:02,804 --> 04:08:17,102
所以这让你思考 尽管其他人认为你是你表面上的样子 你还可以成为谁

2658
04:08:17,142 --> 04:08:20,002
监狱的看守把监狱里所有的囚犯都交给约瑟管理

2659
04:08:20,304 --> 04:08:26,682
他们在那里做的任何事 他都是执行者 监狱看守不用关心他手下的任何事情 因为上帝与他同在

2660
04:08:26,762 --> 04:08:41,293
他所做的事情 上帝都让它繁荣 所以这是一次重复 完全是他作为法老的奴隶时发生的事情的重复 只不过更深入地狱一层 可以这么说 对吧

2661
04:08:41,293 --> 04:08:44,907
所以这里是奴隶--法老 这里是囚犯--监狱主宰

2662
04:08:44,907 --> 04:08:47,175
但这无关紧要 相同的事情发生了

2663
04:08:47,175 --> 04:08:55,525
所以现在约瑟在监狱里 有一天法老心情不好 一时兴起 把他的司酒长和司厨长都扔进了监狱

2664
04:08:55,525 --> 04:08:57,490
他们每个人都做了一个梦

2665
04:08:57,490 --> 04:09:03,967
约瑟解释了这些梦 这似乎是他能做的事情

2666
04:09:03,967 --> 04:09:12,680
他告诉管家 他的梦意味着法老会原谅他 让他重回岗位

2667
04:09:12,680 --> 04:09:20,012
他告诉面包师 法老不会原谅他 他要砍下他的头 把他吊在树上

2668
04:09:20,012 --> 04:09:24,710
这是一个相当激烈的梦 但事情就是这样发生的

2669
04:09:24,710 --> 04:09:27,522
所以无论如何 面包师或司酒长获释了

2670
04:09:27,703 --> 04:09:31,160
约瑟说 你看 也许你可以记住我

2671
04:09:32,885 --> 04:09:35,502
毕竟我在这里帮了你一个忙 并告诉了你一些准确的事情

2672
04:09:35,602 --> 04:09:42,210
但是等到这个长官被释放后 他并没有真正记住他曾在监狱中解梦的事情

2673
04:09:43,323 --> 04:09:49,292
所以现在法老做了一个梦

2674
04:09:50,855 --> 04:09:53,692
他实际上做了两个梦 所以这是另一个双重主题的例子

2675
04:09:53,933 --> 04:09:57,912
所以这个想法是 这些是非常重要的梦 因为它们是成对出现的

2676
04:09:59,433 --> 04:10:05,012
看 有七头体态好 肉质肥美的牛从河中出来

2677
04:10:05,913 --> 04:10:12,992
这些牛在牧场上吃草 看 又有七头相貌差 肉质瘦弱的牛跟在它们后面从河里出来

2678
04:10:14,032 --> 04:10:20,132
这些瘦弱的牛站在河边的其他牛旁 这些体态差 肉质瘦弱的牛

2679
04:10:20,774 --> 04:10:26,341
吃掉了那七头体态好 肉质肥美的牛 法老醒来

2680
04:10:26,341 --> 04:10:29,211
可以理解 这是一个相当恶劣的梦

2681
04:10:29,211 --> 04:10:33,286
然后他又做了一个梦 以此加强印象

2682
04:10:33,286 --> 04:10:39,307
他再次睡着并做梦 看 一个茎上长出了七个又大又好的玉米穗

2683
04:10:39,307 --> 04:10:44,249
看 又长出了七个瘦小的 被东风吹焦的玉米穗

2684
04:10:44,249 --> 04:10:47,865
这七个瘦小的玉米穗吞噬了七个大而满的玉米穗

2685
04:10:47,865 --> 04:10:49,412
在做完这两个梦后

2686
04:10:49,753 --> 04:10:54,832
法老醒来了

2687
04:10:55,355 --> 04:10:58,772
这是因为这件事是上帝所定的 上帝将很快使它实现

2688
04:10:59,454 --> 04:11:03,552
有趣的是 关于梦的一个较好的理论是

2689
04:11:04,375 --> 04:11:06,932
它们是左右半球交流方式的一部分

2690
04:11:07,113 --> 04:11:12,452
或者大脑的非语言部分与大脑的语言部分进行交流

2691
04:11:13,778 --> 04:11:20,512
大脑的非言语部分较少分化且更倾向于全局思考

2692
04:11:21,252 --> 04:11:25,732
它在寻找全世界的模式和异常现象——那些与当前世界观念不太契合的事物

2693
04:11:26,172 --> 04:11:32,432
那些让你感到焦虑和不确定的事物 这些都是你尚未掌握的事物 所以按定义来说

2694
04:11:33,172 --> 04:11:37,392
它们不会很好地融入你对世界的概念化 因为如果你已经掌握了它们

2695
04:11:37,472 --> 04:11:42,732
它们就不会造成这样的影响 因此你大脑中的非语言部分就像一个警报系统

2696
04:11:43,133 --> 04:11:48,692
他们四处寻找你可能出错的地方 然后将这些地方放入图像中

2697
04:11:49,872 --> 04:11:54,072
试图将它们概念化 以便更新你的现实模型 将它们考虑在内

2698
04:11:54,454 --> 04:11:57,832
但这也产生了相当多的负面情绪 尤其是在晚上

2699
04:12:03,476 --> 04:12:11,100
所以我们知道 如果剥夺了人们的梦想 他们就会很快发疯 心理平衡也是动物的必要组成部分

2700
04:12:11,844 --> 04:12:16,622
如果你想知道老鼠的做法 那就是你想把老鼠逼疯

2701
04:12:16,803 --> 04:12:18,092
你可以这样做

2702
04:12:18,092 --> 04:12:23,682
所以你把老鼠放在一个相当小的基座上 然后当你掉下去

2703
04:12:23,964 --> 04:12:30,782
周围是水 当它睡着时 它的鼻子会碰到水 然后它就醒来 这样你可以剥夺老鼠的睡眠

2704
04:12:31,464 --> 04:12:36,482
这样做 老鼠在一段时间后对此反应并不好

2705
04:12:37,706 --> 04:12:40,607
这是发现这一现象的方法之一

2706
04:12:40,607 --> 04:12:43,680
但不管怎么说 梦境似乎确实是一种更新机制

2707
04:12:43,680 --> 04:12:49,042
因此 如果你做了一个非常强烈的梦 比如噩梦 尤其是重复的梦

2708
04:12:49,142 --> 04:12:53,081
好像有什么东西要敲打这扇门 必须让它进来

2709
04:12:53,081 --> 04:12:55,495
而你往往不知道如何让它进来

2710
04:12:55,495 --> 04:12:56,282
这是个问题

2711
04:12:57,206 --> 04:12:57,691
那么 但是

2712
04:12:59,605 --> 04:13:06,013
法老派人去召见约瑟 因为约瑟已经和他的管家谈过了（约瑟替他们解过梦） 他们就赶紧把他从地牢里带了出来

2713
04:13:06,013 --> 04:13:11,172
约瑟刮了胡子 换了衣服 进到法老面前

2714
04:13:11,172 --> 04:13:14,928
我猜他是不想让法老对监狱里人们的穿着感到震惊

2715
04:13:14,928 --> 04:13:18,569
法老对约瑟说 我做了一个梦 没有人能解梦

2716
04:13:18,569 --> 04:13:21,344
我曾听人说过 你可以理解梦境来解释它

2717
04:13:21,344 --> 04:13:24,114
约瑟说 不是我

2718
04:13:24,114 --> 04:13:27,567
而是上帝会给法老一个平安的答案

2719
04:13:27,567 --> 04:13:31,442
所以 雅各布并不是在为自己的解梦能力邀功

2720
04:13:31,723 --> 04:13:38,450
有趣的是 这也表明 尽管他很成功 也很能干 但他一无所有

2721
04:13:38,450 --> 04:13:39,655
他并不自恋

2722
04:13:39,655 --> 04:13:46,342
比如说 如果他碰巧拥有这种天赋 他就会把它视为一种天赋 而不是你知道的 对他有利的东西

2723
04:13:46,563 --> 04:13:49,073
这只是他碰巧能够做到的事情

2724
04:13:49,073 --> 04:13:54,641
所以 就我而言 这是一个具有很好的个性的人的标志

2725
04:13:54,641 --> 04:14:00,030
因为 你知道 人们拥有的天赋其实并不是自己挣来的

2726
04:14:00,030 --> 04:14:04,381
这些就是你的才能 智慧 美貌（如果你有美貌的话）等等

2727
04:14:05,243 --> 04:14:12,042
对此没有必要自鸣得意 因为这虽然很棒 但这只是运气

2728
04:14:12,223 --> 04:14:16,541
而正确的态度是 注意到这是运气使然 并为此心存感激

2729
04:14:23,270 --> 04:14:24,692
这幅画真不错

2730
04:14:28,740 --> 04:14:34,452
看哪 埃及全地将有七年的丰年 其后必有七年的饥荒

2731
04:14:34,613 --> 04:14:37,671
所有的丰收都将被遗忘 饥荒将吞噬大地

2732
04:14:38,334 --> 04:14:43,891
饥荒之后 这地就不富饶了 因为这饥荒是非常严重的

2733
04:14:46,621 --> 04:14:49,432
现在我们也看到雅各布会解梦了

2734
04:14:49,572 --> 04:14:55,112
但他也是那种能够展望未来的人 他认为这是亚当被赶出伊甸园后所被呼召去做的

2735
04:14:55,574 --> 04:15:00,392
当他被赶出天堂时 你将能够概念化这一点

2736
04:15:01,036 --> 04:15:06,352
即使现在事情进展顺利 这并不意味着未来也会顺利

2737
04:15:07,154 --> 04:15:11,032
他是蚂蚁而不是蚱蜢 对吧 在蚂蚁和蚱蜢的故事中

2738
04:15:11,154 --> 04:15:18,072
就像一切都好 但你应该清醒起来 你应该测试看看事情会如何出错

2739
04:15:18,213 --> 04:15:28,632
你可以看看你的系统是否能在事情出错时幸存下来 这是我认为我们都应该留意的 因为我认为我们在现代世界中做得非常糟糕

2740
04:15:28,693 --> 04:15:30,592
测试我们的系统是否可能出错

2741
04:15:35,023 --> 04:15:38,742
好吧 法老对这个解梦印象深刻 也非常担心

2742
04:15:38,782 --> 04:15:42,042
我猜他是个通情达理的人 尽管他把约瑟送进了监狱

2743
04:15:42,042 --> 04:15:44,002
我想他别无选择

2744
04:15:45,724 --> 04:15:50,822
所以现在让法老寻找一个精明和智慧的人 帮助他管理埃及全地

2745
04:15:51,365 --> 04:15:53,982
法老这样做 在埃及全地任命官员

2746
04:15:54,102 --> 04:16:00,342
这是约瑟所说的 在丰收的七年中取埃及地的五分之一

2747
04:16:03,354 --> 04:16:09,206
让他们收集那些好年头的所有食物 并将粮食储存在法老的手下 让他们在城市中储存食物

2748
04:16:11,515 --> 04:16:13,692
就这样 约瑟恢复了他的职位

2749
04:16:15,497 --> 04:16:22,231
于是 法老对约瑟说 我是法老 在埃及全地没有你 没有人能举手或迈脚 （译注：并且在没有约瑟的同意或指示下 埃及全国的任何人都不得有任何行动或决定）

2750
04:16:22,312 --> 04:16:28,870
所以他从监狱里出来了 就我而言 从某种意义上说 他确实

2751
04:16:29,612 --> 04:16:32,672
实际上 他的地位比法老还要高

2752
04:16:32,672 --> 04:16:37,705
这取决于你如何看待这个问题 因为法老把自己降到了礼仪性的地位 对吗

2753
04:16:38,392 --> 04:16:43,089
约瑟承担了所有的责任 做出了所有的决定 所以事实上 他就是法老

2754
04:16:44,072 --> 04:16:47,411
确切地说 他并没有得到荣耀 尽管他并没有为自己做太多坏事

2755
04:16:47,855 --> 04:16:49,366
这也是一个教训

2756
04:16:51,095 --> 04:16:59,971
很久以前 我就为 Quora 写了这些规则 其中一条--我把其中一些写进了你们今天拿到的这本小册子--我没有写的一条规则是

2757
04:17:00,433 --> 04:17:07,610
注意那些人们放弃责任的地方往往潜藏着机会

2758
04:17:08,532 --> 04:17:09,931
我觉得这真的很有趣

2759
04:17:10,414 --> 04:17:13,590
我的意思是 我见过有人在他们的工作中 他们说这样的话 好吧

2760
04:17:14,093 --> 04:17:15,588
和我一起工作的人什么活都不干

2761
04:17:16,813 --> 04:17:18,005
但其实 你可以去做

2762
04:17:19,076 --> 04:17:23,991
我的意思是 我知道这是有限度的 但你在工作中可以做的事情之一就是让自己变得不可或缺

2763
04:17:24,474 --> 04:17:35,750
我的意思是 如果你这样做 你可能会受到藤条的攻击 但不可或缺也是有道理的 因为当人们开始被解雇时 你可能不会是其中之一

2764
04:17:36,173 --> 04:17:41,231
或者说 即使你是不可或缺的 那么你不可或缺的事实也是意味着 你可以去别的地方 成为那里不可或缺的人

2765
04:17:41,574 --> 04:17:42,645
这也同样有用

2766
04:17:43,472 --> 04:17:51,712
因此 要永久地贬低一个真正擅长做事的人是非常非常困难的

2767
04:17:52,375 --> 04:17:54,369
因为他们可以去别的地方做

2768
04:17:55,173 --> 04:18:01,591
要做到这一点 其中一个方法就是在别人失败时承担责任

2769
04:18:02,134 --> 04:18:03,744
你会想 我不应该这么做

2770
04:18:03,744 --> 04:18:04,892
这是一种思路

2771
04:18:04,972 --> 04:18:07,889
另一种想法是 哦 太好了 我可以这样做了

2772
04:18:10,360 --> 04:18:13,392
埃及地丰收的七年结束了

2773
04:18:13,652 --> 04:18:20,962
正如约瑟所说 七年的饥荒开始了 饥荒遍及全地

2774
04:18:21,803 --> 04:18:26,275
嗯 这就是一个原型故事 就在原型故事里

2775
04:18:26,275 --> 04:18:27,980
这是商业周期的故事

2776
04:18:27,980 --> 04:18:32,762
当你挨饿的时候 显然会更残酷一点 但这不是重点 重点是什么

2777
04:18:34,123 --> 04:18:36,742
时好时坏

2778
04:18:36,822 --> 04:18:43,542
你可以肯定 这种情况会发生在你身上 所以聪明人会采取以下措施

2779
04:18:45,103 --> 04:18:49,861
事实上 事情会变得糟糕 这与诺亚的遭遇如出一辙

2780
04:18:50,183 --> 04:18:54,739
这就好比 假设洪水来临 因为它迟早会发生

2781
04:18:54,739 --> 04:18:56,806
你会想 洪水肆虐的世界真可怕

2782
04:18:56,806 --> 04:18:59,594
这就像 如果你有一艘船 就不会这样 对吗

2783
04:18:59,594 --> 04:19:03,045
如果发生洪灾 而你又有一艘船 那就大有帮助了

2784
04:19:03,045 --> 04:19:07,001
这就好比 你可以漂浮在洪水上 然后问题就不大了

2785
04:19:07,001 --> 04:19:07,222
就这样

2786
04:19:07,222 --> 04:19:25,102
因此 如果你拒绝正视这样一个事实 即事情会严重走下坡路 你和你的家人也许在某个时候会陷入困境 那么当事情发生时 它将是最糟糕的

2787
04:19:25,784 --> 04:19:32,222
但如果你对这种可能性保持清醒和警觉 你就能减少这种可能性

2788
04:19:36,515 --> 04:19:38,642
所有的地方都有饥荒 但在埃及有粮食

2789
04:19:39,883 --> 04:19:46,537
当埃及全地饥荒时 人们向法老求粮 法老对埃及人说去找约瑟

2790
04:19:47,144 --> 04:19:52,102
他告诉你们要做什么 你们就做什么 饥荒遍及全地

2791
04:19:52,443 --> 04:19:59,382
约瑟开放了仓库 向埃及人出售粮食 埃及地的饥荒愈发严重

2792
04:19:59,543 --> 04:20:01,842
所有国家都来到埃及

2793
04:20:01,963 --> 04:20:05,562
向约瑟购买玉米 因为所有的地方饥荒都很严重

2794
04:20:07,364 --> 04:20:11,322
当雅各看到埃及有玉米时 雅各对他的儿子们说

2795
04:20:12,523 --> 04:20:14,831
你们为什么站在那里互相看着

2796
04:20:14,831 --> 04:20:17,058
他说 我听说埃及有玉米

2797
04:20:17,058 --> 04:20:22,519
快去那里买一些回来 这样我们就可以活下去 而不是死去

2798
04:20:22,519 --> 04:20:26,151
这是很直接的建议

2799
04:20:26,151 --> 04:20:28,922
约瑟的十个兄弟下埃及去买玉米

2800
04:20:30,187 --> 04:20:33,099
但本雅悯 约瑟的弟弟 也就是最小的那个 对吗

2801
04:20:33,099 --> 04:20:39,907
唯一剩下的 比约瑟年轻的那个 唯一最小的 也是拉结的另一个儿子

2802
04:20:39,907 --> 04:20:44,662
但雅各没有派本雅悯去 因为

2803
04:20:45,803 --> 04:20:49,102
他担心他会遇到不好的事情 这让我觉得

2804
04:20:49,823 --> 04:20:56,262
可能雅各对上次派所有兄弟去冒险时约瑟发生的事情有些怀疑

2805
04:20:58,243 --> 04:21:00,301
约瑟管理着全地

2806
04:21:01,324 --> 04:21:05,202
他向全地的人民出售粮食 约瑟的兄弟们来了 向他俯首

2807
04:21:05,442 --> 04:21:08,117
他们的脸贴着地

2808
04:21:08,117 --> 04:21:12,181
现在 梦成真了 事情的关键也在这里

2809
04:21:14,644 --> 04:21:19,302
在你的生活中 有一个问题是你应该向谁低头 你可能会说没有人

2810
04:21:20,104 --> 04:21:25,022
这个答案并不完全正确 因为这意味着你没有理想 因为你会向自己的理想低头

2811
04:21:25,404 --> 04:21:28,721
这就是理想 如果你没有理想 那你还能做什么

2812
04:21:29,364 --> 04:21:32,922
所以 你必须向某些东西低头 而这里发生的事情就是

2813
04:21:34,285 --> 04:21:36,722
兄弟们向这个如此有韧性和能干的人鞠躬

2814
04:21:36,942 --> 04:21:41,636
他可以让自己走出监狱 成为这片土地的统治者

2815
04:21:41,636 --> 04:21:44,229
在捷克斯洛伐克 瓦茨拉夫-哈维尔就遇到过这种情况

2816
04:21:44,229 --> 04:21:48,827
这种情况也发生在南非的曼德拉身上

2817
04:21:48,827 --> 04:21:50,993
这些事情真的发生了

2818
04:21:50,993 --> 04:21:52,276
这真的很了不起

2819
04:21:52,276 --> 04:21:54,422
所以 只有上帝才知道你在监狱里会学到什么

2820
04:21:55,523 --> 04:22:05,022
所以 他们向约瑟鞠躬致敬 这样你就知道他是谁了 即使他没有穿外套

2821
04:22:05,223 --> 04:22:09,842
约瑟看到了他的兄弟们 他认识他们

2822
04:22:10,024 --> 04:22:11,722
他却让他们感到陌生

2823
04:22:12,024 --> 04:22:14,802
若干年过去了 他对他们粗声粗气地说

2824
04:22:14,882 --> 04:22:19,662
他问他们从哪里来 他们说从迦南地来买食物

2825
04:22:20,723 --> 04:22:29,512
约瑟知道他们的兄弟是谁 但他们不知道他是谁 他们回到他们的父亲雅各那里 把一切都告诉了他

2826
04:22:29,632 --> 04:22:34,812
他说 身为一国之主的人对我们粗暴无礼 把我们当成了间谍

2827
04:22:35,635 --> 04:22:50,483
我们对他说 我们是真正的人 我们是诚实的人 我们不是间谍 我们有十二个兄弟 一个是我们父亲的儿子 一个不是 最小的一个今天和我们的父亲在迦南地

2828
04:22:51,274 --> 04:22:55,272
对方说 想让我知道你们是诚实的人的话 就这样做：留下一个兄弟在这里

2829
04:22:56,196 --> 04:23:00,012
带些食物回去解决你们住所的饥荒 然后把你们的小弟弟带给我

2830
04:23:01,657 --> 04:23:02,710
那我就知道你们不是间谍了

2831
04:23:03,193 --> 04:23:08,012
知道你们是诚实的人 那么我会把另一个兄弟交出来 你们就可以在这片土地上做买卖了

2832
04:23:08,275 --> 04:23:09,852
这样你们就不用饿死了

2833
04:23:09,952 --> 04:23:15,612
当他们清空麻袋时 发现每个人的麻袋里都装着一捆钱

2834
04:23:15,773 --> 04:23:19,246
当他们和他们的父亲看到这些成捆的钱时 他们都害怕了

2835
04:23:19,246 --> 04:23:25,272
他们从约瑟那里买了食物 约瑟把食物给了他们 然后把他们的钱都放回了麻袋里

2836
04:23:26,215 --> 04:23:30,003
我可以想象这会在某种程度上让他们担心 雅各说

2837
04:23:31,074 --> 04:23:34,892
你们已经使我失去了我的孩子 约瑟不在了 西缅现在也不在

2838
04:23:35,033 --> 04:23:38,692
你们还要带走本雅悯 所有这些事情都对我不利

2839
04:23:39,433 --> 04:23:45,912
流便对他父亲说 如果我不把他带回来 就杀了我的两个儿子 把他交到我手上 我会再把他带回来

2840
04:23:45,912 --> 04:23:54,438
他说 不 我的儿子不会和你们一起下去 因为他的兄弟已死 他现在是独自一人 如果在你们去的路上

2841
04:23:55,604 --> 04:24:00,262
他遭遇不幸 那你们将使我的白发带着悲伤下到坟墓

2842
04:24:01,023 --> 04:24:08,142
这里有一个暗示 看看雅各和约瑟故事的最后部分发生了什么 这与理顺自己的家庭秩序的观念有关

2843
04:24:09,423 --> 04:24:13,442
然后整顿你的家庭秩序 可以说这个故事有点颠倒了 因为约瑟先是整理自己

2844
04:24:13,522 --> 04:24:19,001
然后整理了埃及的状态 这实际上很有趣 因为在旧约中埃及是经典的暴政

2845
04:24:20,703 --> 04:24:26,282
所以这里的观念非常清晰 那个穿着彩色外衣的人可以纠正暴政 然后下一个推论是 那么

2846
04:24:35,903 --> 04:24:37,402
他现在必须把家庭放在第一位

2847
04:24:37,623 --> 04:24:42,782
你知道 一般来说 我们会先把自己的事情做好 然后再把家庭的事情做好 最后再把国家的事情做好

2848
04:24:43,144 --> 04:24:45,414
如果你能以不同的顺序做到这一点 其实也没关系

2849
04:24:45,414 --> 04:24:51,582
这可能也是可以的 但是所以故事的结局是

2850
04:24:53,483 --> 04:24:58,262
约瑟做得非常好 他服务的国家也是如此 但这对他来说还不够好

2851
04:24:58,924 --> 04:25:06,301
他希望他的家庭能够正常运转 即使他们对他做了可怕的事情 他也希望他们能够和睦相处

2852
04:25:07,547 --> 04:25:11,322
这非常有趣 因为一旦有人对你做了可怕的事情

2853
04:25:11,483 --> 04:25:19,238
那么 合乎逻辑的事情或者说合乎逻辑的想法就是 你去死吧 你知道吗

2854
04:25:24,151 --> 04:25:32,142
这不是一种有成效的态度 尤其是如果你身边有你必须要面对的人 比如你的家人和朋友

2855
04:25:33,764 --> 04:25:37,282
你们去吃家宴 其中一人打了另一人一拳 另一人又还了你一拳

2856
04:25:37,302 --> 04:25:39,481
然后那就像是接下来30年的家庭晚餐

2857
04:25:40,344 --> 04:25:44,422
即使你是最后一击的那个人 这似乎也不是很有成效

2858
04:25:45,144 --> 04:25:47,882
因为你至少要忍受他们

2859
04:25:48,724 --> 04:25:52,079
放下那些你能放下的 努力使事情变得更好 可能会更好

2860
04:25:53,583 --> 04:25:59,602
为了让事情变得更好 你必须摒弃复仇和怨恨以及所有你带着的那些东西

2861
04:25:59,923 --> 04:26:09,282
但是 想想如果你的家庭运作得非常好 它会是怎样的 这可能会更好

2862
04:26:09,523 --> 04:26:12,110
然后只需坚定不移地朝那个方向努力

2863
04:26:12,110 --> 04:26:13,754
我知道这并不容易

2864
04:26:13,754 --> 04:26:24,556
我的意思是说 人都是非常古怪的 家庭内部的病态程度也是无止境的 当然 这个故事很清楚地说明了这一点

2865
04:26:24,556 --> 04:26:28,447
我是说他们想杀了他 把他卖去做奴隶

2866
04:26:28,447 --> 04:26:30,853
这是一个病态的家庭

2867
04:26:30,853 --> 04:26:42,842
这样说吧 但约瑟的态度是 我们必须摆平这件事 这不仅仅是因为他的父亲 随着故事的发展 你会看到这一点

2868
04:26:43,183 --> 04:26:49,537
由于土地上的饥荒严重 当他们吃完从埃及带回的玉米后 他们的父亲对他们说

2869
04:26:50,265 --> 04:26:51,659
再去买一些食物回来

2870
04:26:52,546 --> 04:27:00,362
犹太对他说 那人严正地警告我们 你们若不带你们的弟弟来 就不得见我的面

2871
04:27:00,563 --> 04:27:02,294
如果没有本雅悯 他们不能回埃及

2872
04:27:04,044 --> 04:27:09,482
他们说那人详细询问了我们的家庭情况 问我们的父亲还活着吗

2873
04:27:09,784 --> 04:27:13,262
你们还有另一个兄弟吗 我们就按照这些话回答了他

2874
04:27:14,283 --> 04:27:20,702
我们怎么能知道他会说 把你们的弟弟带过来 犹太对他父亲以色列说 把弟弟带过来吧

2875
04:27:20,802 --> 04:27:25,262
我们将起身前往 这样我们可以活下来 不至于死亡 我们和你还有弟弟

2876
04:27:25,686 --> 04:27:34,361
我将为他担保 如果我没有把他带回来 放在你面前 那么就让我永远承担这个责任

2877
04:27:36,747 --> 04:27:43,620
因此 犹太 在最初将约瑟卖为奴隶的事件中扮演了相当糟糕的角色

2878
04:27:44,402 --> 04:27:53,082
现在显然已经有所学习 因为他愿意承担责任 冒险

2879
04:27:53,243 --> 04:27:55,640
并代替本雅悯站出来

2880
04:27:55,922 --> 04:27:59,079
所以他在某种意义上把自己变成了一个牺牲品

2881
04:27:59,642 --> 04:28:07,180
因此 约瑟所玩的游戏 因为他在某种程度上在戏弄他的兄弟们

2882
04:28:07,882 --> 04:28:10,600
但他也在测试他们 他玩的游戏是双重的

2883
04:28:10,862 --> 04:28:15,594
一是 你们到底有没有学到什么 还是你们还和以前一样腐败无用

2884
04:28:16,142 --> 04:28:16,877
这是第一个游戏

2885
04:28:17,142 --> 04:28:21,802
第二个是 也许如果我逼迫你们 把你们置于一个相对困难和神秘的情境

2886
04:28:21,902 --> 04:28:27,242
我可以让你们警醒 承担一些责任

2887
04:28:27,362 --> 04:28:33,238
我们可以推动这整个混乱向前发展 所以这似乎正在发生 犹太正在承担责任

2888
04:28:33,522 --> 04:28:39,002
流便也做了同样的事 那些人带着礼物和双份的金钱以及本雅悯一起起身

2889
04:28:39,082 --> 04:28:43,862
抵达埃及 站在约瑟面前 当约瑟看到他们带着本雅悯时

2890
04:28:43,942 --> 04:28:50,482
他对他的管家说 把这些人带回家 准备食物 因为这些人将与我共进午餐

2891
04:28:50,562 --> 04:28:54,882
那个人照约瑟的吩咐行事 把那些人带进约瑟的家

2892
04:28:56,488 --> 04:29:03,139
当约瑟回到家时 他们把手中的礼物呈现给他 并再次向他俯首至地

2893
04:29:04,304 --> 04:29:08,022
他询问他们的安危 并问道 你们说过的那位老人 你们的父亲还好吗

2894
04:29:09,024 --> 04:29:09,686
你们提到过的

2895
04:29:09,686 --> 04:29:10,549
他还活着吗

2896
04:29:10,549 --> 04:29:13,882
他们回答说 你的仆人 我们的父亲 身体很好

2897
04:29:14,184 --> 04:29:14,969
他还活着

2898
04:29:14,969 --> 04:29:17,062
他们低头行礼

2899
04:29:21,493 --> 04:29:28,733
他举目看见他的弟弟便雅悯 就是他母亲的儿子 就说："这就是你对我说的你弟弟吗

2900
04:29:28,733 --> 04:29:37,962
他说：愿上帝恩待你 我的孩子 而后约瑟快步离开 因为他内心十分思念他的兄弟 他寻找地方哭泣

2901
04:29:39,224 --> 04:29:44,782
他进入自己的房间 在那里哭泣 他洗了脸 走出去 克制住自己 说：摆上面包

2902
04:29:46,065 --> 04:29:47,393
他们就坐在他们面前

2903
04:29:47,393 --> 04:29:48,782
现在他又对他的兄弟们施了一个计

2904
04:29:48,983 --> 04:29:52,341
所以他让他们都坐在餐桌上 但他根据年龄把他们排成一行

2905
04:29:53,249 --> 04:29:54,441
他这样做是想要

2906
04:29:55,984 --> 04:29:56,829
他想做什么

2907
04:29:56,829 --> 04:29:59,282
他本质上是想吓唬他们

2908
04:30:00,764 --> 04:30:06,622
因此他做到了 因为他的兄弟们根本不知道这人怎么会知道他们的年龄

2909
04:30:06,743 --> 04:30:08,056
他们认为这是魔法

2910
04:30:08,056 --> 04:30:10,569
他们彼此惊叹

2911
04:30:10,569 --> 04:30:13,522
他从面前拿了些东西 派人送给他们

2912
04:30:13,602 --> 04:30:17,259
而本雅悯面前的食物是其他兄弟的五倍

2913
04:30:17,259 --> 04:30:17,962
他在干什么

2914
04:30:18,686 --> 04:30:20,556
他又在考验他的兄弟们了

2915
04:30:20,556 --> 04:30:30,594
当约瑟还是个孩子的时候 他得到了更多 这意味着他的兄弟们会非常嫉妒 然后杀人灭口 对吗

2916
04:30:30,594 --> 04:30:32,480
现在 他又对本雅悯做了同样的事

2917
04:30:32,480 --> 04:30:33,202
他在想 好吧

2918
04:30:33,263 --> 04:30:44,501
好吧 我会给这个孩子比他应得的更多的东西 我会观察这些恶棍的行为 看看他们是否学到了什么

2919
04:30:46,186 --> 04:30:51,341
他命令他的管家说 将食物装满那些人的袋子 尽可能多地装 还要把每个人的钱也放进袋子里

2920
04:30:51,842 --> 04:30:58,202
还有把我的杯子 那只银杯 放在最小的那个的袋子里

2921
04:30:59,564 --> 04:31:06,427
管家按照约瑟所说的话做了 天一亮 那些人就带着他们的交通工具被送走了

2922
04:31:11,112 --> 04:31:12,998
在本雅悯的袋子里发现了那只杯子

2923
04:31:12,998 --> 04:31:26,230
本雅悯还很年轻 约瑟派人去寻找杯子的下落 他们在本雅悯的麻袋里找到了杯子

2924
04:31:27,016 --> 04:31:33,592
他们对此非常不满 他们说 谁把杯子装进袋子 谁就会受到严厉的惩罚

2925
04:31:34,494 --> 04:31:37,632
他们撕裂了衣服 每个人驮上自己的驴 返回了这座城市

2926
04:31:38,555 --> 04:31:45,758
犹大和他的兄弟们来到约瑟的家 因为他还在那里 他们在他面前跪倒在地 非常紧张和歉意

2927
04:31:45,758 --> 04:31:48,610
约瑟对他们说 你们做了什么事

2928
04:31:50,334 --> 04:31:53,191
难道你不知道 像我这样的人肯定能占卜吗

2929
04:31:54,136 --> 04:31:55,803
我知道发生了什么

2930
04:31:55,803 --> 04:31:57,289
犹大说 我们该说什么

2931
04:31:57,289 --> 04:31:57,992
我们该讲什么

2932
04:31:58,192 --> 04:32:00,478
我们如何可能证明我们的清白

2933
04:32:00,478 --> 04:32:03,345
上帝发现了你仆人的罪孽

2934
04:32:03,345 --> 04:32:10,165
看哪 我们都是你的仆人 包括那个找到杯子的人

2935
04:32:10,165 --> 04:32:17,812
他说 但愿我不至于这样做 但在谁手中找到杯子的那人 他将成为我的仆人

2936
04:32:17,812 --> 04:32:23,540
至于你们 可以平安回到你们的父亲那里去

2937
04:32:23,540 --> 04:32:24,882
这是杯子的发现

2938
04:32:31,935 --> 04:32:37,169
犹大说 现在我回到你仆人我的父亲那里 如果少年人不与我们同在

2939
04:32:37,169 --> 04:32:43,936
因为他的生命与少年的生命相连 若看见少年不在我们中间 他必定会死

2940
04:32:43,936 --> 04:32:49,865
仆人将带着悲伤使你仆人我父的白发下到坟墓

2941
04:32:49,865 --> 04:32:57,639
因为你的仆人为这少年向我父亲担保 说 如果我不把他带回来 我将永远对我父亲负责

2942
04:32:57,639 --> 04:33:05,427
现在 请让我留下来代替这少年 让少年和他的兄弟们一起回去

2943
04:33:05,427 --> 04:33:13,781
若少年不与我同行 我如何能独自回到我兄弟之间 以免我看到将临到我父亲身上的祸患

2944
04:33:13,781 --> 04:33:14,925
好吧 发生了什么

2945
04:33:14,925 --> 04:33:17,132
好吧 他们吸取了教训

2946
04:33:17,132 --> 04:33:24,376
因此 犹太现在又愿意站在本雅悯的位置上 自己成为奴隶

2947
04:33:24,376 --> 04:33:35,695
因此 约瑟现在认定 他的兄弟们的性格已经发展到了可以和解的地步

2948
04:33:35,695 --> 04:33:45,401
你知道 我们常说你应该原谅和忘记 但原谅和忘记的条件是相当具体的

2949
04:33:45,401 --> 04:33:54,180
你知道 如果你与某人发生争执 他在某种意义上对不起你 而他向你道歉 那么问题来了 道歉是什么

2950
04:33:54,180 --> 04:33:56,751
嗯 一个合理的表述也许是

2951
04:33:56,751 --> 04:34:03,582
就我所知 这是我做这件可怕事情的原因 这是我从中学到的东西

2952
04:34:04,043 --> 04:34:09,102
以及为了不再重蹈覆辙 我打算这么做 你能再给我一次机会吗

2953
04:34:09,626 --> 04:34:11,782
这才是正确的忏悔 对吗

2954
04:34:11,923 --> 04:34:18,761
然后你会原谅 因为你也是个傻瓜 你可能也会做一些愚蠢的事 也许你希望在某个时候得到同样的宽容

2955
04:34:19,844 --> 04:34:24,822
而且 如果我们总是在所有可能的时候完全追究彼此的责任

2956
04:34:24,963 --> 04:34:27,982
那就毫无希望了 因为将没有容错的余地

2957
04:34:29,168 --> 04:34:34,122
因此 约瑟所表现的宽恕是明智的宽恕

2958
04:34:34,263 --> 04:34:39,882
他不会因为那些没有吸取教训的人而冒险 以致同样愚蠢的事情再次发生

2959
04:34:40,023 --> 04:34:44,762
让他们继续在所到之处传播痛苦；他将找出他们是否有了一点觉悟

2960
04:34:45,425 --> 04:34:48,642
如果有的话 那么他们就可以继续重建家庭

2961
04:34:50,306 --> 04:34:51,415
这样就打破了他们之间的隔阂

2962
04:34:51,415 --> 04:34:58,562
约瑟在所有站在他身边的人面前再也控制不住自己 他哭了出来 然后他说

2963
04:34:59,485 --> 04:35:09,042
让所有人都离开我 于是除了约瑟的兄弟们 所有人都离开了 没有其他人在场 当约瑟向他的兄弟们透露自己的身份

2964
04:35:09,122 --> 04:35:20,837
约瑟说：“我是约瑟 我父亲还活着吗 ”他的兄弟们无法回答 因为他们在他的面前感到不安

2965
04:35:25,233 --> 04:35:33,212
这可以说是本十年最大的轻描淡写 约瑟对他的兄弟们说：“请走近我一些 ”

2966
04:35:33,272 --> 04:35:41,292
他们走近了 他说：“我是约瑟 你们卖到埃及的那个兄弟 但不要因为你们卖了我而感到悲伤或生气

2967
04:35:41,472 --> 04:35:51,120
因为是上帝保存了我的生命 所以现在是上帝而不是你们把我送到这里的 他使我成为法老的父亲和埃及全地的主

2968
04:35:52,285 --> 04:35:59,646
赶快去告诉我父亲 说你的儿子约瑟这样说 上帝使我成为整个埃及的主

2969
04:35:59,646 --> 04:36:06,182
来到我这里 不要迟延 你将住在歌珊地

2970
04:36:06,242 --> 04:36:11,202
你和你的孩子们 以及你的孙子孙女 你的羊群 牛群和你所有的一切都将靠近我

2971
04:36:11,202 --> 04:36:19,042
在那里我将养活你们 因为还有五年的饥荒 免得你和你的家人以及你所有的一切陷入贫困

2972
04:36:20,104 --> 04:36:23,360
这是另一个暗示

2973
04:36:23,360 --> 04:36:25,484
这里有一个关于面包的暗示

2974
04:36:29,353 --> 04:36:32,887
谁是最可靠的面包来源呢

2975
04:36:32,887 --> 04:36:38,772
嗯 不是面包本身 而是产生面包的东西 这就是约瑟在这个故事中的角色

2976
04:36:39,214 --> 04:36:42,951
他是产生滋养的力量

2977
04:36:42,951 --> 04:36:49,132
约瑟通常被认为是基督的典型 这意味着他在某种意义上是基督的先驱

2978
04:36:49,313 --> 04:36:52,346
这就是一种思考方式 你可以看到它就在那里

2979
04:36:52,346 --> 04:36:55,586
这就像你储存了什么

2980
04:36:56,536 --> 04:36:58,252
为了应对饥荒 你要积蓄品格

2981
04:36:59,656 --> 04:37:00,888
这是最好的穿越它的方式

2982
04:37:02,716 --> 04:37:04,672
但这并不意味着你不储存面包

2983
04:37:07,595 --> 04:37:12,222
他们出了埃及 来到迦南地 到了雅各那里 告诉他约瑟还活着

2984
04:37:12,443 --> 04:37:15,422
他是那里的统治者 雅各仍心灰意冷 因为他不相信他们

2985
04:37:15,984 --> 04:37:26,239
他们把约瑟对他们说过的话都告诉了他 当他看到约瑟派人来接他的所有马车时 他们的父亲雅各的精神又恢复了

2986
04:37:26,239 --> 04:37:29,062
以色列（雅各）说 这就够了 约瑟 我的儿子还活着 我会在死前去看他 然后

2987
04:37:29,523 --> 04:37:39,082
以色列带着他所有的财产出发 来到了别是巴 并为他父亲以撒的神献祭 夜间在异象中 神对以色列说 雅各

2988
04:37:39,985 --> 04:37:51,622
他说：“我在这里 ”神说：“我是神 你父亲的神 不要害怕下埃及去 因为我将在那里使你成为一个大国 ”这就是以色列人最终在埃及的原因

2989
04:37:52,386 --> 04:37:55,762
我将与你同下埃及 并且我也必定使你再次回来

2990
04:37:56,507 --> 04:37:58,922
雅各将按在你的眼睛上

2991
04:37:59,363 --> 04:38:06,519
雅各从别是巴起身 以色列的儿子们扶着他们的父亲雅各 还有孩子们及妻子们 乘坐法老派来载他们的车辆

2992
04:38:07,243 --> 04:38:12,778
如此 家族现在在约瑟安排的适当状态下团结在一起

2993
04:38:12,778 --> 04:38:14,082
他们带走了他们的牲畜和货物

2994
04:38:15,244 --> 04:38:26,022
这也太有趣了 因为约瑟既是外国人 也曾是奴隶和囚犯 外国人 奴隶和囚犯 但他最终统治了埃及

2995
04:38:27,005 --> 04:38:31,862
纯粹是因为他的性格和能力 这确实值得深思

2996
04:38:34,024 --> 04:38:42,022
他们带走了自己的牛 因为这个故事告诉人们 没有比这更强大的力量了 不管在什么情况下 没有比这更强大的力量了

2997
04:38:45,007 --> 04:38:50,315
事实上 我认为这与天真恰恰相反

2998
04:38:52,222 --> 04:38:55,344
无论你身在何处 只要你想做 一般都能把事情做得更好

2999
04:38:57,122 --> 04:39:05,393
除非你所处的地方本身就是地狱 否则这通常会提升你的境界 也会提升你周围人的境界

3000
04:39:06,642 --> 04:39:07,973
你可以在任何地方做到这一点

3001
04:39:08,982 --> 04:39:11,460
因为没有哪个地方是小到你无法做到这一点的

3002
04:39:11,682 --> 04:39:12,792
这是监狱的寓意

3003
04:39:13,842 --> 04:39:16,621
他们带走了在迦南地所得的牲畜和财物

3004
04:39:16,702 --> 04:39:20,347
雅各和他所有的后裔一起来到埃及

3005
04:39:23,352 --> 04:39:26,512
他派犹大在前面去见约瑟 引导他们前往歌珊

3006
04:39:26,552 --> 04:39:28,591
他们来到了歌珊地

3007
04:39:28,692 --> 04:39:36,409
约瑟备好车马 去见他父亲以色列 向他献身 伏在他颈上哭了好一会

3008
04:39:37,092 --> 04:39:42,473
以色列说 我现在可以死了 因为我看到了你的脸 因为你还活着

3009
04:39:46,522 --> 04:39:52,022
法老对约瑟说 你父亲和你的弟兄都到你这里来了 埃及地就在你面前

3010
04:39:52,062 --> 04:39:56,242
你们的父兄可以住在歌珊地 让他们住在那地最好的地方

3011
04:39:56,904 --> 04:40:01,982
如果他们中现在有能干的人 就让他们管理我的牲畜 给他们一份工作

3012
04:40:02,604 --> 04:40:07,302
约瑟带他的父亲雅各进入法老的面前 雅各为法老祝福

3013
04:40:08,624 --> 04:40:12,782
这是一个非常有趣的转变 因为在这种情况下你会期望发生相反的事情

3014
04:40:16,586 --> 04:40:20,222
看来雅各是一个相当自持的人

3015
04:40:21,144 --> 04:40:22,290
因为情况并非如此

3016
04:40:22,290 --> 04:40:28,148
你很可能不会为伊丽莎白女王祈福 除非你胆大包天

3017
04:40:28,148 --> 04:40:30,195
法老对雅各说 你几岁了

3018
04:40:30,195 --> 04:40:35,862
雅各说：我已经一百三十岁了 我一生的日子都是罪恶

3019
04:40:36,303 --> 04:40:41,782
我没有达到我祖先朝圣时的年岁

3020
04:40:42,243 --> 04:40:45,413
雅各为法老祝福 从法老面前走了出去

3021
04:40:45,413 --> 04:40:51,492
以色列在埃及国歌珊地居住 并且人数极其增多

3022
04:40:51,492 --> 04:40:53,782
雅各在埃及地居住了十七年

3023
04:40:55,025 --> 04:40:57,601
所以雅各的寿命共计一百四十七年

3024
04:40:59,064 --> 04:41:01,294
以色列（雅各）临近生命的尽头

3025
04:41:01,294 --> 04:41:06,462
他叫来儿子约瑟 对他说："如果我现在在你眼中蒙了恩典

3026
04:41:07,004 --> 04:41:11,597
请将你的手放在我的大腿下 善意而真诚地对待我

3027
04:41:11,597 --> 04:41:13,342
我祈求你 不要把我葬在埃及

3028
04:41:14,463 --> 04:41:19,761
我要与我的列祖同眠 你要把我带出埃及 埋葬在他们的墓地 "

3029
04:41:21,323 --> 04:41:23,262
约瑟说 我会照你说的去做

3030
04:41:24,427 --> 04:41:28,102
这些事后 有人告诉约瑟

3031
04:41:28,503 --> 04:41:32,797
看哪 你的父亲病了 他带着他的两个儿子 玛拿西和以法莲 去了

3032
04:41:32,797 --> 04:41:39,782
有人告诉雅各说 看哪 你的儿子约瑟来见你了

3033
04:41:40,284 --> 04:41:50,202
以色列振作起来 坐在床上 对约瑟说：“我想不到还能再见到你的面 看哪 上帝也让我看到了你的孩子 ”

3034
04:41:51,464 --> 04:41:55,462
约瑟从他的膝间带出他们 自己面向地俯伏

3035
04:41:55,863 --> 04:42:02,913
约瑟用右手把以法莲引向以色列的左手 用左手把玛拿西引向以色列的右手 把他们带到自己跟前

3036
04:42:03,923 --> 04:42:11,658
以色列伸出右手 放在年幼的以法莲头上 左手放在玛拿西头上 有意识地引导着他的手

3037
04:42:12,343 --> 04:42:18,022
因为玛拿西是长子 约瑟看到父亲把右手放在以法莲的头上 就不悦

3038
04:42:18,464 --> 04:42:22,462
他扶起父亲的手 要把手从以法莲的头移到玛拿西的头上

3039
04:42:23,767 --> 04:42:25,502
约瑟对他父亲说

3040
04:42:25,663 --> 04:42:29,719
“不是这样 我的父亲 这是长子 请把右手放在他的头上 ”

3041
04:42:30,906 --> 04:42:33,000
他父亲拒绝了 并说我知道 我的儿子

3042
04:42:33,000 --> 04:42:36,882
我知道他也将成为一个民族 他也将是伟大的

3043
04:42:36,962 --> 04:42:42,602
但他的弟弟确实将比他更伟大 他的后裔要成为万国之民

3044
04:42:43,344 --> 04:42:51,082
当上帝想要干预人类事务时 他所做的就是颠覆传统

3045
04:42:51,143 --> 04:42:59,442
因此 这是一个迹象 表明有一些新的特别的事情正在发生 这让年幼的孩子比年长的孩子更有优先权

3046
04:42:59,522 --> 04:43:03,161
优先考虑新事物而不是传统事物

3047
04:43:03,161 --> 04:43:11,319
当然 有时这也是必要的 因为传统是不够的 有时必须要有新的东西来更新传统

3048
04:43:11,319 --> 04:43:19,036
雅各把他的儿子们召集起来 说："你们要聚在一起 我好告诉你们末世将要临到你们的事

3049
04:43:19,036 --> 04:43:24,037
雅各的子孙啊 你们要聚在一起听 你们的父亲以色列也要听

3050
04:43:24,037 --> 04:43:33,996
流便 我不一一列举这 12 个字了 流便 你是我的长子 我的大能 我的力量的开端 是尊贵的卓越 是力量的卓越"

3051
04:43:33,996 --> 04:43:44,529
这个故事非常有趣 因为雅各在祝福自己的儿子之前 先祝福了约瑟的儿子

3052
04:43:44,529 --> 04:43:52,335
因此 他所做的就是把长子的权利交给他最爱的儿子

3053
04:43:52,335 --> 04:43:54,101
然后他去找他的儿子们

3054
04:43:54,101 --> 04:44:03,068
因此 这对《圣经》故事的编排方式产生了影响

3055
04:44:03,068 --> 04:44:05,152
尊严与权力的卓越

3056
04:44:05,413 --> 04:44:11,260
水无常 你不得杰出 因为你上了你父亲的床 随后亵渎了它

3057
04:44:11,260 --> 04:44:12,485
他上了我的床

3058
04:44:12,485 --> 04:44:18,919
你或许记得 流便与他父亲的妾同寝

3059
04:44:18,919 --> 04:44:23,713
西缅和利未 我们的兄弟 他们的居所充满了残忍的工具

3060
04:44:23,713 --> 04:44:37,961
那幅画的背后 西缅和利未的事是因为有人与他们的妹妹底拿同寝 然后提出与她结婚

3061
04:44:38,883 --> 04:44:48,021
因此接受了割礼 因为那是交易的一部分 随后让所有的男人也接受割礼 然后西缅和利未在他们恢复期间杀死了他们所有人

3062
04:44:49,323 --> 04:45:02,252
雅各和他的所有人必须离开 因为这激怒了他们的亲戚 所以看看西缅和利未 他们是兄弟 他们的居所充满了残忍的工具

3063
04:45:02,754 --> 04:45:07,412
哦 我的灵魂 不要进入他们的秘密 不要与他们的会议联合 我的荣耀不要团结

3064
04:45:08,234 --> 04:45:15,612
因为在他们的愤怒中 他们杀死了一个人 在他们自作主张中 他们推倒了一堵墙 他们的愤怒是因为它猛烈 他们的愤怒是因为它残忍

3065
04:45:16,136 --> 04:45:18,412
我将在雅各中分散他们 在以色列中散布他们

3066
04:45:19,953 --> 04:45:27,957
犹大 你是我的弟兄们将赞美的 你的手将在仇敌的颈项上 你父亲的子女将在你面前下拜

3067
04:45:27,957 --> 04:45:30,184
犹大是个幼狮

3068
04:45:30,184 --> 04:45:37,730
从猎物中起来 我的儿子 你已经上去 他低下头 蜷伏如狮 又如老狮 谁能唤醒他

3069
04:45:37,730 --> 04:45:48,778
权杖不会离开犹大 法律制定者不会从他脚间离开 直到示罗来临 所有人都将聚集向他

3070
04:45:48,778 --> 04:45:54,314
约瑟是一棵多产的枝条 甚至是一棵靠近水井的多产枝条 它的枝条越过了墙

3071
04:45:54,314 --> 04:46:04,231
射箭的人极度地使他痛苦 向他射箭并且恨他 但他的弓仍保持坚固 他的手臂通过雅各的大能之神变得强壮

3072
04:46:04,231 --> 04:46:06,762
因此 他是以色列的牧羊人 是以色列的磐石

3073
04:46:09,823 --> 04:46:14,982
你父的神也必帮助你 全能的神也必以天上的福气赐福于你

3074
04:46:15,283 --> 04:46:19,382
地下深渊的祝福 野兽 乳房和子宫的祝福

3075
04:46:20,344 --> 04:46:26,102
你父亲的祝福胜过我祖先的祝福 直到永恒之山的尽头

3076
04:46:26,684 --> 04:46:31,522
它们要戴在约瑟的头上 也要戴在那与他弟兄分开的人的头冠上

3077
04:46:33,047 --> 04:46:34,582
这些都是以色列的十二个支派

3078
04:46:36,065 --> 04:46:38,591
这是他们的父亲对他们说的话 并为他们祝福

3079
04:46:38,591 --> 04:46:41,599
每个人都按照他的祝福 他都祝福他们"

3080
04:46:41,599 --> 04:46:55,922
因此 我们在这里看到的在某种意义上是美索不达米亚创世故事中发生的事情的回声 在美索不达米亚创世故事中 有混沌之龙提亚玛特和她的妃子

3081
04:46:58,349 --> 04:47:08,242
分别是淡水和海水 它们混合在一起 混沌和秩序的结合产生了第一个古神大会

3082
04:47:08,782 --> 04:47:15,702
然后古神们随意而愚蠢地杀死了阿普苏

3083
04:47:16,643 --> 04:47:21,722
他们的愚昧无知激怒了提亚玛特 她回来复仇了

3084
04:47:24,505 --> 04:47:33,101
在此期间 她制造了这支庞大的怪兽军团 并让怪兽中最凶残的金古担任军团长 然后决定干掉她的杰作

3085
04:47:33,101 --> 04:47:41,179
因此 这是三千年前的一个小小的警告 警告人们不要愚蠢地破坏自己的传统

3086
04:47:42,633 --> 04:47:46,947
所以不管怎么说 狂热的众神出动了 试图与提亚马丁战斗

3087
04:47:46,947 --> 04:47:53,312
他们不断地带着夹着尾巴回来 但随后一个新的神出现了 那就是玛杜克

3088
04:47:53,473 --> 04:48:04,392
他拥有环绕头部的眼睛 他能够说出魔法般的话语 他们知道这位最新的神有些不同 那是他的视野能力

3089
04:48:04,472 --> 04:48:13,272
以及他清晰表达话语的能力 因此他们说 为什么不出去尝试处理混乱呢 玛杜克说 好 没问题

3090
04:48:13,352 --> 04:48:23,105
条件是 你们把我选为最高神 现在我决定世界的命运 所以他们非常绝望 因为像提亚玛特这样的存在正来追逐他们

3091
04:48:23,105 --> 04:48:31,025
他们可能认为他无论如何都赢不了 所以他们同意了 于是他出去了

3092
04:48:31,773 --> 04:48:35,232
他面对混沌女神提亚玛特 他将她碎尸万段

3093
04:48:36,213 --> 04:48:46,172
他用她的碎片创造了世界 他的一个名字是“那个从与提亚玛特的战斗中创造巧妙事物的人” 这非常有趣 这是如此非凡的事情

3094
04:48:46,212 --> 04:48:50,005
这是一个了不起的术语

3095
04:48:50,005 --> 04:48:52,052
那么 谁应该站在顶峰呢

3096
04:48:53,654 --> 04:48:57,632
这股力量看到了什么 说了什么 并自愿去对抗混沌

3097
04:48:58,635 --> 04:49:00,992
你知道人们花了多少年才明白这一点吗

3098
04:49:01,974 --> 04:49:05,045
这简直就是人类的巅峰发现

3099
04:49:05,045 --> 04:49:06,109
就是这样

3100
04:49:06,109 --> 04:49:06,812
这在这里也得到了回应

3101
04:49:07,495 --> 04:49:09,972
你看西缅和利未 他们太生气了

3102
04:49:10,894 --> 04:49:17,502
其他兄弟 他们都有各种各样的缺点和过失 所以他们没有被提升到最高的位置

3103
04:49:17,502 --> 04:49:19,812
但约瑟 因为他有那件多彩的外衣

3104
04:49:19,953 --> 04:49:29,132
而且无论他走到哪里都能稳稳着陆 因为他不怀恨在心 不苦涩 不恶毒 不具有种族灭绝倾向

3105
04:49:29,232 --> 04:49:40,891
他没有向天空挥舞拳头或因为特朗普而对上帝大喊大叫 比方说 那么他就是 他是12个部落的正确代表

3106
04:49:40,891 --> 04:49:42,546
所以 这很好

3107
04:49:42,546 --> 04:49:43,172
这是一个精彩的故事

3108
04:49:45,897 --> 04:49:50,208
这些都是以色列的 12 个支派 这就是他们的父亲对他们说的话 并为他们祝福

3109
04:49:50,208 --> 04:49:52,279
每个人都得到了他的祝福

3110
04:49:54,136 --> 04:49:56,272
当雅各布结束了对儿子的嘱咐时

3111
04:49:56,493 --> 04:50:08,226
因此 这是他最后的声明 他知道这 12 个部落将成为这个民族的未来 现在他正在尝试

3112
04:50:08,226 --> 04:50:17,963
最后 他试图将这些人的相对美德分等级 以表明他们学到了什么

3113
04:50:17,963 --> 04:50:23,532
雅各吩咐完儿子们 就把脚收在床上 撒手人寰

3114
04:50:23,592 --> 04:50:27,432
约瑟伏在他父亲的脸上哭泣

3115
04:50:27,532 --> 04:50:35,928
亲吻了他 约瑟命令他的仆人让医生给他的父亲做防腐处理 医生们防腐了以色列

3116
04:50:35,928 --> 04:50:42,352
悼念的日子过去后 约瑟向法老的家中说 如果现在我在你眼中找到恩典

3117
04:50:43,052 --> 04:50:54,032
请在法老耳边说 我的父亲让我发誓说 看哪 我将死在我在迦南地为自己挖的坟墓里 你必须把我埋在那里 现在请让我去

3118
04:50:54,213 --> 04:51:04,832
我请求你让我上去埋葬我的父亲 然后我会回来 法老说 上去埋葬你的父亲 照他让你发誓的去做 因为他的儿子们把他带到迦南地并埋葬

3119
04:51:04,952 --> 04:51:14,065
在麦比拉田地的洞穴里 这是亚伯拉罕为了作为埋葬地购买的田地 是从赫人以弗仑面前的麦利

3120
04:51:14,065 --> 04:51:25,002
埋葬父亲后 约瑟和他的兄弟们及所有上来的人一起返回了埃及

3121
04:51:25,002 --> 04:51:27,994
当约瑟的兄弟们看到他们的父亲去世后 他们说

3122
04:51:30,373 --> 04:51:36,512
约瑟现在会恨我们 并且一定会对我们进行报复 偿还我们对他所做的一切恶事

3123
04:51:37,714 --> 04:51:41,672
他们派了一个使者说 我父亲临死前命令说

3124
04:51:42,573 --> 04:51:48,892
你们要对约瑟说 我请求你现在原谅你兄弟们和他们的罪行 实在是太卑微了

3125
04:51:49,613 --> 04:51:55,052
因为他们对你行了恶 现在我们请求你原谅你父亲的仆人们的过失

3126
04:51:55,273 --> 04:52:06,392
当他们对他说这些话时 约瑟哭了 他的兄弟们也来到他面前跪下 他们说 看哪 我们是你的仆人 约瑟对他们说 不要害怕

3127
04:52:07,734 --> 04:52:11,612
我岂能代替神呢 但对于你们 你们认为对我有恶意

3128
04:52:12,074 --> 04:52:17,392
但神让它变成好事 为了像今天这样拯救许多人的生命

3129
04:52:21,437 --> 04:52:33,252
所以现在不要害怕 我会养活你们和你们的孩子 并且安慰他们 对他们说些友好的话

3130
04:52:33,492 --> 04:52:43,407
这里的想法是 没有什么邪恶是善不能战胜的

3131
04:52:46,693 --> 04:52:49,828
约瑟和他父亲的家住在埃及 约瑟活了110年

3132
04:52:50,672 --> 04:52:58,266
约瑟看到了以法莲的第三代子孙 玛吉尔的儿子 玛拿西的子孙 也在约瑟的膝上长大

3133
04:52:59,813 --> 04:53:08,552
约瑟对他的兄弟们说 我要死了 神必定会看顾你们 并把你们从这个地方带到他对亚伯拉罕 以撒和雅各所发誓的地方

3134
04:53:10,056 --> 04:53:20,191
约瑟让以色列的子孙发誓说 神必定会看顾你们 你们应该从这里带走我的骨头 所以约瑟死了 享年一百一十岁 他们对他进行了防腐处理

3135
04:53:21,577 --> 04:53:24,552
他被放入在埃及的棺材中

3136
04:53:25,861 --> 04:53:27,049
这就是《创世纪》

3137
04:53:29,653 --> 04:53:47,262
所以谢谢大家的坚持

3138
04:53:47,502 --> 04:54:18,282
谢谢你们 谢谢

3139
04:54:18,944 --> 04:54:25,642
在我看来 这非常值得 收获很大 我非常期待继续进行

3140
04:54:25,742 --> 04:54:35,002
非常感谢大家的支持和全神贯注的关注 以及你们在这次努力中的认真态度和关心 这真的是

3141
04:54:35,102 --> 04:54:45,902
一个能够做到这一点的特权 这是一件完全超现实的事情 到目前为止 你知道 大约有五百万人看过这个

3142
04:54:45,922 --> 04:54:49,259
所以这似乎是一件非常好的事情 是的

3143
04:54:58,794 --> 04:55:09,501
好的 我要问问问题者 如果你在过去三次会议中已经提过问题 请今天不要再问问题了 因为我无法回答每个人

3144
04:55:09,762 --> 04:55:16,361
所以我希望能听到一些我之前没有回答过的人的问题 如果可以的话

3145
04:55:18,347 --> 04:55:22,762
嗨 彼得森教授 只要两秒钟 非常感谢您 我代表我的社区和犹太社区

3146
04:55:23,404 --> 04:55:29,080
许多人受到了您的启发 成为了更好的人 我没有向您表达感谢就无法和您对话 所以非常感谢您

3147
04:55:31,288 --> 04:55:32,111
有几件事情

3148
04:55:32,111 --> 04:55:34,742
首先我想简单评论一下 你可能会觉得这很有趣

3149
04:55:34,882 --> 04:55:43,722
在犹太人的星历中 我们每年都要阅读摩西五经 而恰好我们正在阅读《托拉》故事的这一部分

3150
04:55:43,983 --> 04:55:53,302
故事哦 这很酷 也很同步 是啊 这让我想到了一个问题 我想问你 这是一个问题 有两个部分

3151
04:55:53,382 --> 04:56:02,481
关于你的希伯来语知识 因为如果你看看犹太教堂里的托拉卷轴 就会发现那里没有元音 没有句子

3152
04:56:03,345 --> 04:56:10,581
我想知道您对希伯来语的了解有多少 而希伯来语中又有多少层含义

3153
04:56:11,629 --> 04:56:13,382
我对此极其无知

3154
04:56:14,905 --> 04:56:17,842
所以你知道我读了很多评论 对吧

3155
04:56:18,003 --> 04:56:23,302
我尝试聚焦我们今天讨论的每一个短语

3156
04:56:23,563 --> 04:56:32,502
我大概看了十种不同的评论 然后我有这种潜在的心理分析知识 有点像

3157
04:56:33,925 --> 04:56:37,121
如果你有许多不同的模板去观察事物

3158
04:56:38,025 --> 04:56:42,481
然后某些东西同时透过所有这些模板显现 这是非常不可能的

3159
04:56:43,042 --> 04:56:51,692
所以你可以知道 一个巧合是一回事 但五个巧合 那不再是巧合 那是别的什么东西

3160
04:56:52,334 --> 04:56:57,471
所以我想 尽管有很多事情我不知道

3161
04:56:57,952 --> 04:57:04,551
但我知道足够多的事情 可以在某种程度上有用地穿梭其中 即使不是确定无疑

3162
04:57:05,513 --> 04:57:20,792
是的 因为我刚才 这是第二部分 我猜你可能不知道 但米德拉什 犹太口传的故事 几乎和这些故事一样久远 它们填补了许多令人难以置信的 疯狂的 随机的细节

3163
04:57:21,012 --> 04:57:30,391
我遇到过其中的一些 但再次说明 如你所知 这是一个非常丰富的传统 所以我没有遇到足够多的内容

3164
04:57:31,433 --> 04:57:36,629
你有没有想到特别是与这个故事相关的具体事情

3165
04:57:36,629 --> 04:57:37,452
我其实忘了

3166
04:57:37,532 --> 04:57:40,905
我本来打算带给你一本米德拉什的书

3167
04:57:40,905 --> 04:57:42,772
现在这么说真是太糟糕了

3168
04:57:45,435 --> 04:57:47,972
嗯 我只是觉得我必须说这些

3169
04:57:49,213 --> 04:57:51,057
但是 也许对于出埃及记的版本

3170
04:57:51,057 --> 04:57:52,361
我会带给你的 好吧 好吧

3171
04:57:52,361 --> 04:57:53,383
那会很好

3172
04:57:53,383 --> 04:57:57,132
是的 好的 你好 彼得森博士

3173
04:57:57,553 --> 04:58:04,512
我想请你谈谈荣格所说的心理死亡 也被称为自我死亡

3174
04:58:05,613 --> 04:58:07,238
好的 对不起 请再说一遍

3175
04:58:07,238 --> 04:58:12,512
你能谈谈荣格所指的心理死亡 也叫做自我死亡吗

3176
04:58:15,077 --> 04:58:17,362
那是当有人 爱你的人背叛你时发生的事情

3177
04:58:19,304 --> 04:58:27,342
对 想象一下 世界复杂得超出理解 当你只能看到一小部分时

3178
04:58:28,365 --> 04:58:33,442
你构建理解的方式是你对事物做出假设 这些都是简化的假设

3179
04:58:33,522 --> 04:58:39,088
所以如果你信任某人 你大大减少了他们的复杂性 对吗

3180
04:58:39,088 --> 04:58:41,202
因为比如说我们结婚了

3181
04:58:42,264 --> 04:58:45,922
那你会以一些更简单的方式行事

3182
04:58:47,364 --> 04:58:50,902
好的 那我在某种意义上可以忍受与你相处

3183
04:58:51,803 --> 04:59:03,532
因为你并无法同时拥有一切 那些简化的结构是层级化组装的 其中一些比其他的更重要

3184
04:59:04,574 --> 04:59:07,372
信任是其中之一 尤其是对亲人家庭成员的信任

3185
04:59:07,452 --> 04:59:11,152
这就是为什么家庭成员的背叛是真正的灾难性的

3186
04:59:12,154 --> 04:59:17,572
因为它动摇了你的过去 所有你拥有的记忆 动摇了你的现在 动摇了你的未来

3187
04:59:18,055 --> 04:59:21,152
它动摇了你对人类的信念 包括你自己

3188
04:59:22,033 --> 04:59:24,531
而且一切都崩溃了 那就是自我死亡

3189
04:59:26,934 --> 04:59:31,932
在荣格看来 自我之下还有另一个结构 他称之为自性

3190
04:59:32,655 --> 04:59:35,872
自性是在自我死亡中保持恒定的东西

3191
04:59:37,336 --> 04:59:42,891
但它更深层次 更非个人化 是原型的

3192
04:59:44,074 --> 04:59:49,032
它是自我崩溃时坍塌成的东西 然后重建自我

3193
04:59:49,753 --> 04:59:53,812
就像这样 随时间发生 但这就是自我死亡的现象

3194
04:59:54,555 --> 04:59:59,657
这里有不同的变体 因为你可以经历自愿或非自愿的自我死亡

3195
04:59:59,657 --> 05:00:03,676
自愿的自我死亡是当你学到很多东西并愿意放手时

3196
05:00:03,676 --> 05:00:06,308
那就是你自己的自焚

3197
05:00:06,308 --> 05:00:10,428
就像你是一只凤凰 在自己身上点火

3198
05:00:10,428 --> 05:00:14,625
这是一个更好的想法 尽管它仍然可能非常严酷

3199
05:00:14,625 --> 05:00:17,458
非自愿的自我死亡对人们来说真的很困难

3200
05:00:17,458 --> 05:00:28,411
人们会做几乎任何事情来阻止这种情况的发生 这部分是为什么他们努力维持他们群体所培养的公理化简化

3201
05:00:28,914 --> 05:00:39,162
这并不奇怪 因为这是非常……你会失去你的……像那样的自我死亡是一次进入地狱的旅程 或是崩溃进入混乱 如果你有意为之 那并不那么糟糕

3202
05:00:40,052 --> 05:00:45,729
但在《木偶奇遇记》中 比如 这通过木偶去深海救他的父亲从鲸鱼肚子里体现了

3203
05:00:46,132 --> 05:00:48,666
现在他是自愿去的 但它几乎要了他的命 对吗

3204
05:00:49,692 --> 05:00:52,041
首先 他几乎没能从鲸鱼那里逃出来

3205
05:00:52,041 --> 05:00:56,436
其次 他实际上淹死并死了 但他又活了过来

3206
05:00:56,436 --> 05:01:04,469
所以即使你自愿去做 它仍然......它只是比非自愿去做要好 那是另一种选择

3207
05:01:04,469 --> 05:01:05,312
所以这就是它的本质

3208
05:01:05,312 --> 05:01:14,065
你下了一个赌注

3209
05:01:14,065 --> 05:01:16,168
你好 博士

3210
05:01:16,168 --> 05:01:22,692
所以我现在第二次回听这些圣经讲座 我想向你展示一个我的观察

3211
05:01:22,853 --> 05:01:29,852
因为我试图找到一个你之前没被问过的问题 这比我的瑞尔森考试还难

3212
05:01:29,993 --> 05:01:40,692
确实如此 所以我注意到 我觉得你变得更有趣了 哦是的 哦不 我认为Michael Coren这周说过

3213
05:01:40,732 --> 05:01:50,532
我想但他用的词是“奇怪” 我认为实际上我感觉更好了 所以我其实有幽默感 很难相信 但是当我不觉得随时都会死掉的时候

3214
05:01:50,733 --> 05:01:59,272
它就回来了 所以是的 我基本上注意到 一 你在尝试更多的笑话 这很好

3215
05:01:59,372 --> 05:02:17,172
谢谢你 谢谢 这些笑话更频繁地引起笑声 但还有第三个因素 我认为这是Steve Martin退出的原因

3216
05:02:17,353 --> 05:02:23,952
我认为观众更预期会有笑话 他们实际上 你知道 我注意到人们在不打算说笑话的时候笑得更多

3217
05:02:24,113 --> 05:02:29,457
所以我只是想知道你怎么看 它们是有意为之的

3218
05:02:29,457 --> 05:02:30,721
我希望它们是有意为之的

3219
05:02:30,721 --> 05:02:34,092
仅仅因为我面无表情 并不意味着它们不是有意的笑话

3220
05:02:34,834 --> 05:02:36,721
所以是的 不错

3221
05:02:36,721 --> 05:02:39,672
看 其中一件事就是 我一直试图保持这一点

3222
05:02:40,294 --> 05:02:45,072
我在大约五年前学到的 即使你在处理非常严肃的事情

3223
05:02:45,694 --> 05:02:49,452
如果你不以轻松的方式处理它 你就不是一个专家

3224
05:02:49,512 --> 05:02:50,857
你不是一个大师

3225
05:02:50,857 --> 05:02:55,231
你可能会想 有些事情是如此深沉和黑暗 你无法轻松处理它们

3226
05:02:55,853 --> 05:02:59,343
实际上这是不对的

3227
05:02:59,343 --> 05:03:01,269
这并不意味着你对它们掉以轻心

3228
05:03:01,269 --> 05:03:02,392
这并不意味着那样的事情

3229
05:03:02,452 --> 05:03:06,689
你不会......这是最小必要的力量

3230
05:03:06,689 --> 05:03:07,412
就是这样的东西

3231
05:03:07,492 --> 05:03:10,021
你不会比必要的更用力

3232
05:03:10,021 --> 05:03:13,151
当你讨论严肃的事情时 这是一种艺术

3233
05:03:13,552 --> 05:03:19,152
所以 这样做的一个结果就是 因为我们在讨论严肃的问题

3234
05:03:19,233 --> 05:03:22,132
因为现在整个文化界都在讨论严肃的问题

3235
05:03:22,192 --> 05:03:24,810
如果每个人都能保持幽默感 那就真的太好了

3236
05:03:25,594 --> 05:03:33,670
你知道 我看到了积极的迹象 比如网络上有很多讽刺活动 你知道 这很容易催化成恐怖暴徒

3237
05:03:34,153 --> 05:03:35,138
但事实并非如此

3238
05:03:35,138 --> 05:03:37,732
你知道 这在某种程度上正在发生

3239
05:03:37,812 --> 05:03:42,712
但其中很多都是讽刺和喜剧 只要我们能保持幽默感就好

3240
05:03:42,833 --> 05:03:44,671
然后我想

3241
05:03:45,654 --> 05:03:48,552
我们离灾难并不那么近 所以

3242
05:03:48,993 --> 05:03:56,092
让我感到不祥的是 有些喜剧演员首先因为言论自由而受到迫害

3243
05:03:57,152 --> 05:04:04,812
我认为限制立法绝对是骇人听闻的 而且现在有些喜剧演员不愿意在大学校园里表演 约翰-克莱斯不愿意在大学校园里表演

3244
05:04:07,880 --> 05:04:12,412
《宋飞正传》（Seinfeld） 你知道他有多令人反感吗  我是说他是最直率的人

3245
05:04:13,172 --> 05:04:17,525
你能想象到的最友善的喜剧演员 他不会在大学校园里表演

3246
05:04:17,525 --> 05:04:20,112
我认为路易斯·CK不会在任何地方表演

3247
05:04:23,373 --> 05:04:34,952
但这是一个坏兆头 但是没有幽默是不好的 这很有趣 因为我有点怪异地观察我在网络上的呈现方式 出现了所有这些模因

3248
05:04:35,052 --> 05:04:46,992
我不知道 有成千上万的该死的东西 其中大部分都是滑稽的 这很好 像人们在做他们在做的事情

3249
05:04:47,052 --> 05:04:50,232
我不知道那到底是什么 但它是以相对轻松的方式完成的

3250
05:04:50,413 --> 05:05:00,255
这真的非常好 这就是应有的方式 你必须有幽默感 我的意思是这是让生活变得可以忍受的事情之一 或许甚至比忍受更好

3251
05:05:00,255 --> 05:05:02,197
所以你打赌

3252
05:05:02,197 --> 05:05:10,049
你好 彼得森博士

3253
05:05:10,049 --> 05:05:19,857
我只想说 这个系列讲座真不错 这是今年的最后一期 祝您和您的家人圣诞快乐

3254
05:05:19,857 --> 05:05:20,339
谢谢

3255
05:05:20,339 --> 05:05:20,721
谢谢

3256
05:05:20,721 --> 05:05:23,591
我只想说

3257
05:05:24,213 --> 05:05:28,687
别太着急

3258
05:05:28,687 --> 05:05:30,412
我给你写了一篇问与答的文章

3259
05:05:30,633 --> 05:05:38,992
然后我使用了心理学230课的讲座或论文写作指南 将其缩减到只有几页 几行

3260
05:05:39,012 --> 05:05:44,371
然后在这次特定的讲座中 之字形幻灯片再次出现

3261
05:05:44,452 --> 05:05:49,351
我想 啊 我基本上已经得到了所有问题的答案

3262
05:05:49,452 --> 05:06:03,212
所以基本上 我只想问一个想法：你多年前在 YouTube 上做了一个讲座

3263
05:06:03,312 --> 05:06:10,151
你一直提到该隐和亚伯 以及该隐杀死亚伯和诅咒

3264
05:06:10,472 --> 05:06:16,307
我想 好吧 那是两个兄弟的冲突

3265
05:06:17,535 --> 05:06:26,251
但在雅各布的 12 个儿子中 有一个是好人 他是亚伯的原型

3266
05:06:26,752 --> 05:06:28,888
在他之后还有 11 位

3267
05:06:29,592 --> 05:06:34,206
所以 这 我不知道 也许有什么东西的划分 或 呃

3268
05:06:36,455 --> 05:06:37,703
不 这是一个很好的观察

3269
05:06:37,703 --> 05:06:38,770
我还真没想到

3270
05:06:39,353 --> 05:06:40,096
是啊

3271
05:06:40,096 --> 05:06:44,952
嗯 我的意思是 有一点变化 因为鲁本 鲁本并不像其他人那么糟糕

3272
05:06:45,012 --> 05:06:48,630
但是 我会说 对于该隐一方来说 繁殖可能更容易一些

3273
05:06:49,737 --> 05:06:50,985
幸运的是 它没有那么强大

3274
05:06:52,596 --> 05:06:54,066
因为它并没有做什么 像 它...

3275
05:06:57,076 --> 05:06:59,321
是的 是的 你知道 有

3276
05:07:00,246 --> 05:07:04,199
荣格常常被指控信奉摩尼教

3277
05:07:05,283 --> 05:07:14,742
我发音可能不准确 但存在一个基督教教条的变体 它认为善与恶是独立的形而上学现实

3278
05:07:15,483 --> 05:07:22,562
并且它们在为宇宙的统治而战 类似于这样 但它们都拥有独立的存在

3279
05:07:22,723 --> 05:07:25,582
而传统的基督教观念战胜了那种观念 认为善是真实的

3280
05:07:25,763 --> 05:07:31,002
但恶是善的缺失 现在这种善的缺失产生了各种后果

3281
05:07:31,222 --> 05:07:36,241
读荣格的书很有趣 因为他在他的讨论中

3282
05:07:36,982 --> 05:07:42,042
确实展现了一种摩尼教的倾向 我认为这部分是因为他非常关注纳粹德国发生的事情

3283
05:07:42,764 --> 05:07:49,982
以及随后的冷战 你知道 因为恶似乎是一种可感知的力量 但我不认为它像善那样强大

3284
05:07:49,982 --> 05:07:56,076
但我确实认为它更容易繁殖 因为这是一条更简单的路径

3285
05:07:57,144 --> 05:08:02,182
怀恨在心 敌对 痛苦并且什么也不做是很容易的

3286
05:08:03,046 --> 05:08:04,662
这很可怕 对人们来说很艰难

3287
05:08:04,742 --> 05:08:11,402
但这并不需要巨大的信心或努力 也许这就是为什么在《创世纪》的最后一个故事中 它被成倍地放大了

3288
05:08:12,284 --> 05:08:19,842
是的 我一直在提前阅读 而且是基于对目前介绍的故事的兴趣

3289
05:08:19,922 --> 05:08:26,636
我还关注了《圣经》中的其他几本书和章节 比如《哥林多前书》第 13 章 那是关于爱的章节

3290
05:08:27,722 --> 05:08:34,561
这引出了一个想法 我可以在生活中拥有一切 知识 力量 但这一切都是短暂的

3291
05:08:34,662 --> 05:08:40,181
而现在和永远的 是信仰 希望和爱

3292
05:08:40,523 --> 05:08:43,238
然后 当然 爱战胜一切

3293
05:08:44,103 --> 05:08:45,060
是啊 爱的问题

3294
05:08:45,322 --> 05:08:51,701
你看 我对爱与真理之间的关系思考了很多 因为我对真理思考得更多 谈论得更多

3295
05:08:52,403 --> 05:08:56,760
我认为部分原因是因为“爱”是一个你几乎无法说出口的词 因为它已经如此...

3296
05:08:58,186 --> 05:09:01,921
就像是被一辆车拖过泥水坑 有点那个意思 （译注：“爱”这个词经历了各种复杂和不尊重的处理 就像是一个本应干净 珍贵的东西被随意地拖拽在泥泞中 从而变得肮脏和不再珍贵）

3297
05:09:02,764 --> 05:09:10,062
但是 对不起 让我把这个想法阐述完 但我认为爱的想法是与以下内容相关联的

3298
05:09:10,985 --> 05:09:15,542
至少对我来说 我在本讲座开头所讨论的信仰问题就是如此

3299
05:09:15,682 --> 05:09:21,101
我认为 你必须决定自己对"存在"的态度

3300
05:09:22,044 --> 05:09:26,901
在我看来 正确的态度是 你在为改善它而努力

3301
05:09:27,864 --> 05:09:37,841
你知道 也许你对自己的态度就像对你所爱的人一样 比如儿子 女儿或妻子 你希望事情变得更好

3302
05:09:38,664 --> 05:09:40,091
这就是你的目标

3303
05:09:40,091 --> 05:09:44,311
因此 目标基本上是以爱为动机的

3304
05:09:46,064 --> 05:09:50,942
你希望事情变得更好 因为我认为这是爱的一个很好的定义 就像你真的在乎一个人一样

3305
05:09:51,645 --> 05:09:54,382
你能看出来 因为你希望他们过得更好

3306
05:09:54,863 --> 05:10:00,922
然后 我认为真理就嵌套在其中 因为我认为真理是爱最好的仆人

3307
05:10:07,204 --> 05:10:12,344
我最近一直在为一个想法纠结 我在想也许你能帮我解决这个问题

3308
05:10:12,344 --> 05:10:21,691
基本上 在最近的一次采访中 你谈到了神话是如何调和现实中固有的矛盾的 对吗

3309
05:10:21,691 --> 05:10:34,835
但我有点被两种神话或精神分析的观点所困扰 我认为这两种观点都非常重要 但它们似乎有内在的矛盾 我一直想弄明白

3310
05:10:34,835 --> 05:10:40,342
所以一方面 你有这样一个想法 在你生活中的某些时刻 你需要识别出自己身上的不足之处

3311
05:10:40,482 --> 05:10:53,988
识别出某些问题 你需要进行一种有控制的焚烧 或像凤凰那样的转变 舍弃不合适或不起作用的部分自我

3312
05:10:53,988 --> 05:11:04,982
但另一方面 你也谈到了荣格学派的观点 即随着年龄的增长 你会变得真正成熟起来 你会重新吸收关于 "人 "的东西

3313
05:11:05,062 --> 05:11:14,462
你在年轻时丢失的自我 或者你知道你正在尝试整合你的阴影部分 或者你正在寻找你的性格中的某些部分

3314
05:11:14,583 --> 05:11:18,681
也许这些部分是你之前一直在拒绝的 现在你试图弄清楚如何将它们融入整体之中

3315
05:11:18,681 --> 05:11:23,435
他有一句话我很喜欢 那就是 我宁愿完整 也不愿优秀

3316
05:11:23,435 --> 05:11:30,000
因此 一方面 你可能会发现某些东西是个问题 你想摆脱它或烧掉它

3317
05:11:30,522 --> 05:11:39,858
但从另一方面看 要想变得更强大 似乎就得想办法把所有东西都组合在一起

3318
05:11:40,724 --> 05:11:52,979
因此 荣格在他的炼金术著作中写到的其中一件事 就是解释炼金术的首要箴言 即溶解和整合

3319
05:11:54,986 --> 05:11:56,971
好吧 想象一下

3320
05:11:56,971 --> 05:12:04,840
想象一下 你有一个相当有敌意的父亲 他不善于控制自己的攻击行为

3321
05:12:06,067 --> 05:12:08,481
除此以外 他还是个正派的人

3322
05:12:09,165 --> 05:12:11,701
所以你的反应是 我永远不会咄咄逼人

3323
05:12:12,922 --> 05:12:17,501
因此 你已经建立了一种道德结构 这是你人格的一部分

3324
05:12:18,782 --> 05:12:24,501
除此之外 还有一种可能性是 你否认了道德……

3325
05:12:25,503 --> 05:12:27,600
你否认任何道德

3326
05:12:29,110 --> 05:12:29,639
你会怎么说

3327
05:12:30,264 --> 05:12:33,982
你已经剥夺了侵略性的任何伦理效用

3328
05:12:34,865 --> 05:12:35,948
好吧 那么会发生什么呢

3329
05:12:35,948 --> 05:12:38,818
这部分烧掉后 又会重新出现

3330
05:12:38,818 --> 05:12:40,022
现在 你还必须整合它

3331
05:12:40,503 --> 05:12:46,082
因此 它在某种意义上与尼采的"道德是懦弱"的观点有关

3332
05:12:46,844 --> 05:12:52,881
因为尼采对传统道德最尖锐的批判之一 比方说

3333
05:12:53,423 --> 05:12:57,038
的是 大多数所谓的道德都不是道德

3334
05:12:57,038 --> 05:12:57,941
这只是懦弱

3335
05:12:58,263 --> 05:13:01,556
并不是说我是个好人 我不会伤害你

3336
05:13:01,556 --> 05:13:02,901
是我害怕伤害你

3337
05:13:03,243 --> 05:13:07,142
因为我不想承认我害怕伤害你 所以我说我有道德

3338
05:13:07,242 --> 05:13:12,661
因为这样我就可以用道德的幌子来掩盖我本质上的恐惧和懦弱

3339
05:13:13,124 --> 05:13:16,122
这种情况比你想象的要常见得多

3340
05:13:16,202 --> 05:13:18,961
因为无害和道德绝不是一回事

3341
05:13:19,804 --> 05:13:25,082
我认为 弗洛伊德的天才之处就在于此

3342
05:13:25,403 --> 05:13:31,642
因为他专注于攻击性和性欲 而这或许是人格中最难融合的两个部分

3343
05:13:32,223 --> 05:13:47,162
说 过于简单化的道德观阻碍了你挖掘心灵深处的潜能

3344
05:13:48,027 --> 05:13:50,220
部分原因是它们是原始的力量

3345
05:13:50,925 --> 05:13:53,822
你不想和他们有任何瓜葛 这并不奇怪

3346
05:13:54,164 --> 05:13:57,382
你要远离可能会让它们显现的环境

3347
05:13:57,442 --> 05:14:01,161
但问题是 以这种方式否认自己最糟糕的一面 就是在压制它

3348
05:14:01,664 --> 05:14:04,521
你就排除了最好的可能性

3349
05:14:05,185 --> 05:14:08,602
因为如果不整合自己的攻击能力 就不可能成为一个好人

3350
05:14:09,604 --> 05:14:13,181
因为没有这种侵略能力 你就无法说不

3351
05:14:14,483 --> 05:14:22,690
因为"不"的意思是 如果你真的这么说 "不"的意思是 你对我做的任何事情都无法让我改变主意

3352
05:14:22,690 --> 05:14:26,401
或者反过来说 这意味着我会比你玩更大的赌注

3353
05:14:28,703 --> 05:14:33,362
除非你把你的侵略性整合起来 否则你不可能这么说

3354
05:14:33,442 --> 05:14:37,481
如果你这么做了 没人会认真对待你 因为他们知道这只是一场秀

3355
05:14:38,482 --> 05:14:44,742
因此 我认为荣格所做的最有用的事情之一 就是研究"阴影的整合"这一理念

3356
05:14:44,862 --> 05:14:47,188
因为他真的对"邪恶"这个概念很感兴趣 对吗

3357
05:14:47,188 --> 05:14:53,182
特别是在试图理清第二次世界大战期间纳粹德国所发生的事情方面

3358
05:14:53,822 --> 05:14:57,277
你该如何处理你身上具有攻击性和潜在恶意的部分

3359
05:14:57,277 --> 05:14:58,201
你就这样把它压碎了吗

3360
05:14:58,662 --> 05:15:00,572
从某种意义上说 这就是超我的反应

3361
05:15:00,572 --> 05:15:02,621
你会把它抛诸脑后吗

3362
05:15:03,583 --> 05:15:05,209
有这种可能吗

3363
05:15:05,209 --> 05:15:08,161
还是承认它的存在并将其带入游戏

3364
05:15:08,683 --> 05:15:15,621
这对弗洛伊德来说 道德是超我对本我的钳制

3365
05:15:16,487 --> 05:15:17,939
他们从根本上是对立的

3366
05:15:18,905 --> 05:15:21,802
荣格和皮亚杰都有不同的想法 我认为他们是对的

Here are the translations for the subtitles:

3367
05:15:21,862 --> 05:15:26,041
就像 不 不 你邀请坏人出来玩

3368
05:15:26,765 --> 05:15:29,060
所以 你是一个好斗的曲棍球运动员

3369
05:15:29,843 --> 05:15:32,772
但这是一种有纪律的侵略性

3370
05:15:32,772 --> 05:15:35,600
这让你接触到了一种你本不会拥有的能量来源

3371
05:15:36,864 --> 05:15:42,362
然后关于性 嗯 放肆的性行为并不构成一种美德

3372
05:15:43,164 --> 05:15:47,473
但是 无法避免的处女/处男状态也不对 对吧

3373
05:15:47,473 --> 05:15:51,342
事实上 我认为那更糟 因为它也以美德的面目掩盖自己

3374
05:15:51,382 --> 05:15:58,001
就像 你应该能够做你本不会做的事情

3375
05:15:59,585 --> 05:16:03,515
这就是一个真正道德的人的定义

3376
05:16:03,515 --> 05:16:05,981
他们可以做 但他们不做

3377
05:16:07,425 --> 05:16:09,010
那不是懦弱

3378
05:16:09,010 --> 05:16:13,362
所以 你烧掉阻碍那种整合的东西

3379
05:16:14,423 --> 05:16:30,242
所以当你说解散和整合时 把这两个想法结合起来的一个好方法可能是：烧掉和困难的过程是必要的 因为你自己的各个部分以一种不正常工作的僵硬方式结构在一起 对吗

3380
05:16:30,583 --> 05:16:33,732
是的 这就是吉贝托在鲸鱼肚子里的情况

3381
05:16:33,732 --> 05:16:37,322
他被自己的预设观念困住了 无法逃脱

3382
05:16:38,064 --> 05:16:40,048
所以皮诺丘代表了新的力量

3383
05:16:40,048 --> 05:16:41,311
所以这非常有趣

3384
05:16:41,311 --> 05:16:46,322
所以当你看皮诺丘试图救他时 吉贝托的第一反应是将皮诺丘误以为是鱼

3385
05:16:46,362 --> 05:16:48,369
因为他想要吃东西

3386
05:16:48,369 --> 05:16:52,362
但皮诺丘比吃的东西更好 因为他可以救他 所以他不需要吃东西

3387
05:16:52,824 --> 05:16:57,362
然后皮诺丘想生火 吉贝托反对 因为这会烧光所有家具

3388
05:16:57,402 --> 05:17:01,362
但 如果我们要从鲸鱼里出去 我们不需要那些该死的家具 你知道吗

3389
05:17:02,023 --> 05:17:07,075
所以吉贝托 他年纪大了 所以那是僵硬的结构

3390
05:17:07,075 --> 05:17:10,342
在新的一年到来之前 旧的一年必须逝去

3391
05:17:10,984 --> 05:17:15,362
这是一场森林大火 它允许新的生长 这些东西就是这样组合在一起的

3392
05:17:16,366 --> 05:17:20,362
看 知道这一点也很有用 因为如果你烧掉了一些东西 你可能会想 好吧 什么都没剩下

3393
05:17:20,623 --> 05:17:22,812
这就像 这不是真的

3394
05:17:22,812 --> 05:17:25,101
如果是枯木 那就有新的生长空间

3395
05:17:25,763 --> 05:17:29,371
你要经常这样做

3396
05:17:29,371 --> 05:17:34,142
这就是蛇蜕皮变身的样子吧

3397
05:17:34,964 --> 05:17:38,636
这就是从心理学角度看死亡与复活

3398
05:17:38,636 --> 05:17:39,860
想法完全一样

3399
05:17:40,362 --> 05:17:42,447
现在我们还不知道上限是多少 对吧

3400
05:17:42,447 --> 05:17:46,958
因为我们不知道 如果一个人把所有能放下的都放下了 他会是什么样子

3401
05:17:48,865 --> 05:17:52,322
可以说 只让那些看起来合适的人进来

3402
05:17:53,504 --> 05:18:05,342
但你可以看到 有趣的是 在某种程度上我们并不知道 你可以看到人们开始这样做 这并不是什么罕见的经历

3403
05:18:05,824 --> 05:18:11,362
人们的进步非常快 他们可以很快改善自己的生活 很多都是低垂的果实

3404
05:18:11,803 --> 05:18:17,342
比如 如果你不再做那些明知愚蠢的蠢事 你的生活就会改善很多

3405
05:18:18,625 --> 05:18:20,951
这样 你就解放了

3406
05:18:20,951 --> 05:18:24,801
这也意味着 有一种元素也与自豪感有关

3407
05:18:26,124 --> 05:18:33,262
因为人们倾向于为自己所是的人感到骄傲 这是个坏主意 因为这会阻止你成为你可能成为的人

3408
05:18:33,402 --> 05:18:37,438
因为如果你为自己所是的人感到骄傲 当有必要放手时 你不会放手

3409
05:18:37,438 --> 05:18:38,362
你不会远离它

3410
05:18:38,362 --> 05:18:43,379
你知道 然后你最终会成为自己的仿制品 类似于这样

3411
05:18:43,379 --> 05:18:49,922
这也是一个非常糟糕的主意 你希望不断地从过去的自我中脱离出来 所以这很重要

3412
05:18:50,504 --> 05:18:58,962
我猜这也是一部分 你必须决定 你知道你是秩序还是混乱 或者你是调解它们之间的过程

3413
05:18:59,002 --> 05:19:02,561
如果你是调解它们之间的过程 你就是那个转化的事物

3414
05:19:02,862 --> 05:19:14,786
这是人类的正确态度 因为这就是我们的本质 我们是自愿面对混乱并转化它的存在

3415
05:19:14,786 --> 05:19:21,363
无论好坏 这就是我们最深层的生物本质

3416
05:19:21,363 --> 05:19:25,469
因此 如果你知道未来会有更大的发展 就可以放手不管

3417
05:19:25,469 --> 05:19:35,562
那么 再来一个

3418
05:19:36,743 --> 05:19:39,742
感谢您抽出宝贵的时间 感谢您与我们大家共度美好时光

3419
05:19:39,945 --> 05:19:40,762
嘿 我的荣幸

3420
05:19:40,902 --> 05:19:42,588
这是我的荣幸

3421
05:19:42,588 --> 05:19:56,060
所以 如果可以的话 既然《创世纪》已经写到结尾 我希望有机会向你提出质疑 或者至少让你重新审视一下你对该隐谋杀亚伯的反思所持的立场

3422
05:19:56,060 --> 05:19:59,319
我之所以提出这个问题 是因为《创世纪》中的这个部分一直困扰着我

3423
05:19:59,822 --> 05:20:06,233
因为它不像通常所说的那样简单明了 而且我一直在纠结这个问题

3424
05:20:06,233 --> 05:20:12,502
因此 在这个系列中 以及在你的几次意义地图讲座中 你总结了以下内容

3425
05:20:12,502 --> 05:20:16,642
该隐得出结论认为他的所作所为会导致惩罚的效果

3426
05:20:16,963 --> 05:20:30,415
这超出了他认为自己所能面对的范围 我认为这是对特定翻译选择错误的自然解读 或者是编辑们为了可读性而做出的无辜选择
Here are the translations for the subtitles:

3427
05:20:30,415 --> 05:20:36,437
所以在创世纪第4章第13节 该隐并没有说“我的惩罚大过我所能承受”

3428
05:20:36,437 --> 05:20:43,382
他实际上说的是 虽然我只是如此 我的罪过大过我所能承受 也就是说

3429
05:20:44,025 --> 05:20:53,082
这就是说 这不是他过去的行为 这不是他过去的行为 而是他未来的后果

3430
05:20:53,162 --> 05:20:57,762
这是他过去的行为 而不是他未来的后果 他为此感到遗憾 他说我无法承受的罪孽或罪过

3431
05:20:57,923 --> 05:21:04,981
反映了他腐败的现实 而不是向神祈求怜悯以免受苦 好吧 这就是

3432
05:21:05,763 --> 05:21:16,377
似乎是一个更深层次的解释 我会说 我认为这更是——这和陀思妥耶夫斯基在《罪与罚》中追求的推理路线是一致的 对吧

3433
05:21:16,377 --> 05:21:21,817
因为在《罪与罚》中 拉斯科尔尼科夫犯下了谋杀罪 然后他无法忍受

3434
05:21:21,817 --> 05:21:25,070
他无法忍受自己的所作所为 因为他已经不是原来的他了

3435
05:21:25,070 --> 05:21:28,022
但更让他无法忍受的是 他竟然逃脱了惩罚

3436
05:21:28,022 --> 05:21:32,517
因此 这更符合这一解释

3437
05:21:32,517 --> 05:21:37,880
这也反映在第 414 节下面的诗句中 他陈述了自己行为的后果

3438
05:21:38,323 --> 05:21:42,076
主要是上帝的存在将被隐藏起来 他将被杀死

3439
05:21:42,563 --> 05:21:46,018
这节经文以 hein 开头 意思是确实 或多或少

3440
05:21:46,642 --> 05:21:49,158
并表示一种接受感 而不是抱怨

3441
05:21:49,903 --> 05:21:57,298
这就是 "哦 不 上帝会不会对我掩面而泣 我会不会被追捕"与 "上帝当然会对我掩面而泣 我会被追捕并杀害"之间的区别

3442
05:21:57,663 --> 05:22:08,421
我一直在思考这个问题 并认为这可能意味着我们可能会犯下一些罪过 而这些罪过会把我们逼得太紧

3443
05:22:08,944 --> 05:22:10,493
好吧 好吧 有 好吧 好吧

3444
05:22:12,123 --> 05:22:19,982
例如 在创伤后应激障碍的情况下就会出现这样的情况

3445
05:22:20,062 --> 05:22:26,141
是人们认为自己做了很糟糕的事情 却不知道如何纠正

3446
05:22:27,728 --> 05:22:35,556
因此 你可以说 在这种情况下 上帝的面容对他们是隐藏的 因为他们无法弥补

3447
05:22:35,556 --> 05:22:42,662
他们无法接受这一点 它无时无刻不在那里 他们看不到它之外的任何美好事物 从本质上说 这就是地狱

3448
05:22:43,344 --> 05:22:53,821
因此 有时当你与创伤后应激障碍患者一起工作时 你会向他们灌输一种善恶哲学 这样他们就能看清了

3449
05:22:54,324 --> 05:22:58,482
当约瑟和他的兄弟们谈话时 他们都很内疚 对吗

3450
05:22:59,104 --> 05:23:04,822
他不想让他们有更多的负罪感 否则只会给他们带来负担

3451
05:23:04,882 --> 05:23:09,361
他说 听着 别忘了 是的 是的 是你 但这也是上帝的旨意

3452
05:23:10,242 --> 05:23:16,121
我曾经有个客户患有强迫症 他是个非常聪明的人

3453
05:23:16,523 --> 05:23:22,741
他还碰巧在一个有大量放射性物质的实验室工作 这对有强迫症的人来说不是个好地方

3454
05:23:23,523 --> 05:23:32,882
他担心自己会犯什么错误 这在强迫症患者中很常见 会导致别人遭受痛苦 而你会的 你会这么做的

3455
05:23:33,483 --> 05:23:48,982
直到我让他把自己和自己的生活部分地看作是一种自然力量 他才能够接受自己的错误会产生灾难性后果的可能性

3456
05:23:49,604 --> 05:23:54,982
但人们经常会发现自己处于这样的境地：他们无法对自己的所作所为感到和解

3457
05:23:55,383 --> 05:24:04,782
我认为 你所描述的解释 从心理学的角度来看是有道理的

3458
05:24:05,203 --> 05:24:09,821
有些事情会把我们逼得太紧 超出我们的极限

3459
05:24:10,564 --> 05:24:16,721
但是 如果我们的行为缺乏我们可以接受并从中吸取教训的真理 那么我们的行为也不会有任何后果

3460
05:24:17,304 --> 05:24:20,561
这就是我从该隐和亚伯这一段中深入探讨的问题

3461
05:24:21,003 --> 05:24:30,981
既然如此 为什么我们在面对悲剧 尤其是自己造成的悲剧时 要花那么长的时间 要了解那么多的自我 才能承担起个人责任呢

3462
05:24:35,993 --> 05:24:41,471
嗯 我觉得你不要低估纯粹的难度所带来的贡献

3463
05:24:42,453 --> 05:24:50,752
比方说 你因为身边的人去世而悲伤

3464
05:24:52,014 --> 05:24:54,366
这就好比 你失去的不仅仅是他们

3465
05:24:54,366 --> 05:24:55,211
这是很重要的一部分

3466
05:24:55,211 --> 05:25:02,952
就是你必须重建自己 这真的很难做到 而且这在某种程度上与

3467
05:25:03,692 --> 05:25:09,712
你的错误的严重性成比例 所以如果你犯了一个错误 然后你认识到这是一个错误 如果它只是一个表面的错误

3468
05:25:09,913 --> 05:25:16,689
就像 嗯 你只需要修补一下油漆 但有时整个底层结构都已经腐烂

3469
05:25:19,753 --> 05:25:24,047
你不知道该怎么办 那么这就是一个问题

3470
05:25:24,047 --> 05:25:27,301
我经常在别人身上看到这种情况

3471
05:25:27,301 --> 05:25:32,102
比方说 他们在离婚时不知所措

3472
05:25:32,102 --> 05:25:33,969
他们无法解决问题

3473
05:25:33,969 --> 05:25:39,472
这太复杂了 他们没有足够的资源 也许还浪费了一些资源

3474
05:25:39,613 --> 05:25:46,752
但有时他们就是没有资源 如果再加上错误 罪恶 恶意 盲目和所有其他东西 人们就会...

3475
05:25:47,695 --> 05:25:54,132
有个叫托马斯-萨兹的人在上世纪六十年代写过一篇非常有趣的文章 实际上是一本书 书名叫《精神病的神话》

3476
05:25:55,015 --> 05:26:00,252
在我接受培训时 这本书是临床心理学家的经典读物

3477
05:26:00,653 --> 05:26:10,072
原因是萨兹指出--这是事实--很多时候 如果你是一名心理治疗师 人们来找你并不是因为他们有心理疾病

3478
05:26:10,774 --> 05:26:14,732
他们来找你 是因为生活中遇到了无法解决的问题

3479
05:26:15,235 --> 05:26:26,292
你知道 比如他们可能在工作中有过两年的婚外情 他们的妻子是酗酒者 而且他们的父亲患有阿尔茨海默症

3480
05:26:27,516 --> 05:26:31,344
他们好像不知道该怎么做了

3481
05:26:31,344 --> 05:26:37,252
你知道他们不应该有外遇 所以这涉及道德问题 也许他们应该干预家庭中的酗酒问题

3482
05:26:37,533 --> 05:26:40,886
也许他们利用妻子酗酒作为外遇的借口

3483
05:26:40,886 --> 05:26:42,432
你知道这些事情会变得非常纠结

3484
05:26:43,075 --> 05:26:46,172
只是 它太他妈复杂了 让人无法理清头绪

3485
05:26:47,133 --> 05:26:53,772
所以 我想说 这与你对该隐的解释是一致的 这听起来像是

3486
05:26:54,374 --> 05:27:00,404
这也是为什么阅读多个译本非常有用的原因之一 对吧 因为细微差别很重要

3487
05:27:01,574 --> 05:27:10,851
在我看来 从他的描述中 他至少短暂地醒悟过来 注意到了自己的所作所为 然后说："我再也回不去了

3488
05:27:11,333 --> 05:27:16,172
而且 你很容易就会去到不知道如何回来的地方

3489
05:27:16,292 --> 05:27:20,692
现在 你知道了 他们说 在上帝面前 万事皆有可能 救赎总是有可能的

3490
05:27:20,973 --> 05:27:27,172
无论罪过有多严重 但我要告诉你 有时人们根本不知道如何从自己走过的地方走回来

3491
05:27:30,577 --> 05:27:33,882
你通常能理解人们为什么不这么做 对吗

3492
05:27:34,403 --> 05:27:39,062
卡尔-罗杰斯（Carl Rogers）在谈到心理治疗时也说过这样的话

3493
05:27:39,163 --> 05:27:42,982
如果一个人没有意识到自己有问题 你就无法对他进行心理治疗

3494
05:27:43,903 --> 05:27:50,870
因此 认识到自己有问题是一件非常重要的事情 它或许能打开康复之门

3495
05:27:50,870 --> 05:27:57,176
但这也意味着你已经意识到自己有问题 而这可能是非常非常...这就是沙漠 对吧

3496
05:27:57,176 --> 05:28:03,634
你摆脱了暴政 但你身处沙漠 烈日当头 你能否活下来是无法确定的

3497
05:28:04,443 --> 05:28:04,565
那么

3498
05:28:05,905 --> 05:28:06,197
谢谢

3499
05:28:06,322 --> 05:28:07,290
晚安 保暖

3500
05:28:08,762 --> 05:28:09,328
谢谢大家
