1
00:00:00,962 --> 00:00:04,200
I'd like to welcome you all to this important event,

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,900
and I would also like to apologize to those among your friends, relatives,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,566
and colleagues who could not be here today as the auditorium sold out in a matter of hours.

4
00:00:14,366 --> 00:00:15,891
My name is Joffrey Clarkfield.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,900
It is my privilege to be the executive director of the Speakers Action Group,

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:32,589
and I would like to thank founding president Shirley Ann Haber and our new president Irving Weisdorf and all the volunteers who have worked so hard to make this event happen.

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,054
I would also like to thank our partner organization, the Masood Freedom Foundation,

8
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:41,237
and the Council for Muslims Facing Tomorrow,

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,758
who are the joint sponsors of this event.

10
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,813
The Speakers Action Group in particular, and its supporting groups,

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,919
is dedicated to the fight against anti-Semitism and racism.

12
00:00:56,162 --> 00:01:03,537
But without freedom of speech, there could be no fight against anti-Semitism or racism.

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,393
For we need freedom of speech to defend our rights.

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,400
And as we will hear today,

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:23,566
freedom of speech is most threatened where, ironically, it should be most free in the media, in the colleges, in the universities of this country,

16
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:25,733
as well as in other democracies.

17
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,237
I would like to introduce the emcee for this afternoon,

18
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:32,095
Faith Goldie from the Rebel Media,

19
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:37,813
an organization that is at the forefront of the fight for free speech in this country.

20
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,276
I'd like her to introduce our two distinguished speakers,

21
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,738
Professor Jordan Peterson and Dr. Norman Deutch.

22
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,045
Faith, thank you so much for being here today.

23
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,559
He's been a dishwasher, a gas jockey, a bartender,

24
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:02,094
a short order cook, a beekeeper, a plywood mill laborer, and a railway line worker.

25
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:08,216
But today, Professor Jordan B. Peterson is best known for his work in the academic world.

26
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,718
He has published more than 100 scientific papers transforming the modern understanding of personality

27
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:21,874
and revolutionizing the psychology of religion with his now classic book, Maps of Meaning, The Architecture of Belief.

28
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:26,416
As a Harvard professor, he was nominated for the prestigious Levinson Teaching Prize.

29
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:28,496
Now at the University of Toronto,

30
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,374
he is regarded by students as one of their truly life-changing teachers.

31
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:38,797
And I think that I speak for a great deal of people in this room and, frankly, across the country when I say,

32
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:45,937
you needn't be one of Professor Peterson's students to have been enlightened and inspired by that eight-pound universe between his ears,

33
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:47,759
as well as his bravery.

34
00:02:51,909 --> 00:03:02,599
Most recently, Dr. Peterson became the centre of an ongoing national controversy for refusing to abide by the University of Toronto's attempt to put very specific words into his mouth

35
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:06,319
when they ordered professors comply with the gender pronouns policy.

36
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:10,859
Dr. Peterson's vivid dissent over language politics and the political agenda behind it

37
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,645
has seen him threatened and shouted down by snowflake students and the academic hierarchy alike.

38
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:23,959
A result of his public views on how political correctness violates freedom of speech and academic freedom in the West,

39
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,998
Professor Peterson has become a cultural icon for liberty lovers,

40
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,078
and a long-awaited obstruction to the wayfarers on the long march of the institutions.

41
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,977
Please join me in welcoming Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.

42
00:03:52,626 --> 00:04:02,290
So about three months ago, I sat in my office at night.

43
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:06,109
I wasn't really sleeping very well because my mind was running.

44
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:14,588
And it was running because I had just read some policy documents on the Ontario Human Rights Commission website in relationship to Bill C-16.

45
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:32,909
And, at the same time, I had heard that the University of Toronto HR and Equity Vice-President had decided to make anti-unconscious bias training mandatory for her staff,

46
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,766
which I find appalling, and still find appalling.

47
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:45,990
And I would recommend that if any of you are asked or required to have your unconscious biases adjusted that

48
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:54,490
you might note to yourself that by agreeing to do so you have agreed that you're guilty and I wouldn't recommend that

49
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,670
Anyways, I was mostly trying to straighten out my thoughts on these issues

50
00:05:00,472 --> 00:05:07,400
You know and and that's usually what I do when I speak you know you know because and I have a good Reputation as a speaker,

51
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:15,978
and I think there's two reasons for that one is I don't ever speak to a group I always speak to individuals, I'm not speaking to the group.

52
00:05:15,978 --> 00:05:21,910
I'm speaking to individual people, and I'm not telling you what's right, because I don't know what's right.

53
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:27,710
What I'm trying to do is to formulate my thoughts more clearly,

54
00:05:28,572 --> 00:05:32,830
and it's helpful to do that in speech, even in front of an audience, because it's a dialogue with an audience.

55
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,890
You know, if you watch the individuals, then they, you can tell if they're following you, or whether,

56
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:42,533
mostly whether they're following you, if they can understand the line of the argumentation

57
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:46,766
and some of them will be shaking their heads and some of them will be nodding

58
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:50,266
and you know some of them will be looking puzzled in which case you have to kind of reformulate

59
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:54,733
and so and that's that's how I that's how to think

60
00:05:54,733 --> 00:06:01,566
and when you're speaking to people it's okay to tell them what you know but better to show them how you think

61
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:06,700
and that means you're going to stumble around like an idiot some of the time because you're trying to grapple with things

62
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,210
and what I try to do for my students is to to model the process of grappling with things,

63
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:17,453
because that's what you do when you think

64
00:06:17,453 --> 00:06:23,466
and Norman pointed out that you can be right or you can try to get smarter and to be right

65
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:29,000
then you convince people that you're right but to try to get smarter you find out why you're wrong

66
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,050
and so I decided a long time ago that one of the ways to deal with my authoritarian tendencies

67
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,733
let's say was to make friends with what I don't know instead of what I do know

68
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:42,066
and that's a whole different way of looking at the world, you know,

69
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:49,200
and it's it's got its pain because you know, you're always trying to figure out more or less why you're a biased moron

70
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,300
and that's a very long list of that's a very you have a very long list of reasons for that

71
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,500
and then you have to find out why you're wrong

72
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:05,933
and as a short-term mechanism for attaining psychological stability I wouldn't recommend it but as a long-term process

73
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:14,266
where you're trying to make things work better in the medium to long term, then it's the only way,

74
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:16,066
but you know, it's easy to sacrifice the future for the present, although it's kind of the reverse of the way you should do things.

75
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,766
So anyways, I made these videos, pretty amateur videos, and you know,

76
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:27,000
the lighting wasn't very good, and there was a bunch of things wrong with them,

77
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:41,726
but one of the things I've been wondering about for the last three months is just what what happens like what's going on here.

78
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:48,987
This is crazy and I've been accused of a lot of things, some of which are no doubt true

79
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:54,690
but I've been accused of being a racist and being a transphobe and what else profiteering

80
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,618
and I guess the other one was scare mongering.

81
00:08:00,618 --> 00:08:04,110
Yeah, that's the other one scare mongering and so of course I've been wondering

82
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:08,200
if those things are true because it's not like you know,

83
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:14,230
my heart is as pure as the driven snow hardly and everyone has biases and all of that so

84
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:21,366
and I also…… Well this unfolded had a group of friends who were definitely critics

85
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:27,466
who were watching everything I was doing and you know letting me know pretty forthrightly when I was being arrogant

86
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:34,666
and when I was look kind of disheveled and when my arguments weren't as clear as they could be

87
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:38,933
and so and these were smart people and their comments were very incisive

88
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:44,371
and then of course I had all the blowback, and I was paying attention to it,

89
00:08:44,371 --> 00:08:48,300
because, Well, you should pay attention to such things and so and I do pay attention to things,

90
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,266
that's the thing I actually pay attention to things and

91
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:57,489
if I'm embroiled in a controversy, even if it's a like problem in my home,

92
00:08:59,013 --> 00:09:01,190
I try to get to the damn bottom of it

93
00:09:01,613 --> 00:09:03,990
The bottom of things is not a pretty place to look

94
00:09:05,473 --> 00:09:07,990
And so you know when you're arguing with someone at home

95
00:09:09,154 --> 00:09:10,125
even someone you love

96
00:09:10,991 --> 00:09:16,150
You'll notice that your argument can get out of hand a pretty quick, so if you're arguing with your wife or your husband

97
00:09:17,353 --> 00:09:19,710
You know it depends on how volatile you are of course

98
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:29,030
But you know you start arguing about some little thing and then

99
00:09:30,374 --> 00:09:36,210
You can't understand pretty quick that it's actually not about that little thing at all that little thing is associated with

100
00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:42,166
You know a little bigger thing underneath that and maybe that's associated with even a bigger thing under that

101
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:50,466
soon you're taking each other apart for assuming you've been married for 20 years for all the stupid things you've done to each other over the last 20 years

102
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:53,583
And it doesn't have to end there, and that's not pleasant.

103
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:57,733
It's really hard to bind a conversation So it doesn't go everywhere,

104
00:09:57,733 --> 00:10:02,200
so one thing you can do if you're talking to someone about something you disagree with someone you love,

105
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:09,266
you can tell them a bunch of good things about what they've been doing which you actually believe and then just say well, but there's this little problem here

106
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:14,866
and I just like it adjusted in a minor way and maybe that'll you know sort things out a bit between us

107
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:17,166
and then maybe you don't fall into that stupid pit

108
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:20,030
which is really easy to fall into and you know which certainly can lead to

109
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:26,770
divorce among other things and so a huge part of the issue always is just exactly what is this about

110
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:34,190
Well, I've been asking myself that question for a long long time because I've been interested in

111
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:42,190
authoritarian conflict and atrocity and totalitarianism for way longer than anyone with any sanity should ever be interested in it and

112
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:47,427
You know and then this and then this all came up, and I thought okay, okay, okay?

113
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:52,070
It's like all right Well, you know, am I a bigot and a transphobe?

114
00:10:52,170 --> 00:11:00,030
Well, I probably have my biases because people tend to have in-group biases, you know, and that's associated, by the way, with compassion.

115
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:07,950
Just so you know it, because one of the things compassion does is make you much strongly, much more strongly bound to your in-group, you know.

116
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:15,070
It's like a mother is compassionate because she loves her baby, and she loves the baby more than other things that aren't the baby, obviously.

117
00:11:15,672 --> 00:11:25,164
And so actually compassion is one of the main sources of in-group bias which is something for the compassion warriors to think about for like three-fifths of a second.

118
00:11:25,164 --> 00:11:30,730
There's there's nothing less compassionate to you than a mother grizzly bear protecting her cubs

119
00:11:31,552 --> 00:11:38,110
And so you should think about that when you think about empathy for a minute because empathy is by no means an untrammeled moral virtue

120
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:43,130
In fact it's responsible and can be responsible for absolutely atrocious actions

121
00:11:43,752 --> 00:11:50,450
It depends on who you're empathizing with you know and if you're empathizing with someone that you regard as an infantilized victim

122
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:58,590
then you automatically snap into a frame of mind where everyone who might be oppressing that infantilized victim is a predatory parasite,

123
00:11:59,271 --> 00:12:07,685
and you're not very bloody empathetic to them I can tell you so that's a big problem

124
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,030
Anyways with regards to this scare mongering issue

125
00:12:11,992 --> 00:12:24,550
so yeah yeah biased yeah probably and blind definitely like more than more than you might expect no I don't think so

126
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:33,670
and one of the things  that actually protected me through all this was that you know I've actually tried to come to terms with the evil that lurks in human hearts particularly my own

127
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:45,430
and I have 500 hours of lectures on that online if anybody you know has the bizarre desire to pound their way through them they can more or less think figure out what I think

128
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:54,966
because I said 500 of hours of it publicly and so I didn't feel too bad about my level of bigotry or hatred you know

129
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:57,900
I think you could probably infer that by watching the video

130
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,866
so it's kind of protected on that front and then there was the scaremongering issue

131
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,733
and that's a good one is that's a tough one man

132
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:08,966
because you know if you look at Bill C-16 it just kind of looks like

133
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:15,600
Well we're extending protection to another oppressed group which isn't actually true because gender identity

134
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,166
by the way you know gender expression that's not a group

135
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:23,630
I'd like just like to point that out because terminological accuracy actually matters

136
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,866
So we've extended legal protection to fashion essentially

137
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:36,733
and you can say, Well maybe I'm you know being a bit intransigent about that, but I read the damn policies, and I don't think I am

138
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:42,100
And that's not a group so that's an indication of the muddle-headedness behind the legislation

139
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,966
And then the federal government the department of justice did say on their own website

140
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:51,890
that they were going to interpret that law in light of the policies of the Ontario Human Rights Commission

141
00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:57,270
and so, fine man go to the Ontario Human Rights Commission if they haven't taken the policies off yet

142
00:13:57,832 --> 00:14:03,066
and read what they're up to and if that if you agree with that well good agree with it

143
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:11,262
But I would suspect that if you agree with it you don't you didn't understand it or you're up to something and that comes to the next part.

144
00:14:11,262 --> 00:14:13,570
What are what are we really talking about here?

145
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:18,866
Well, so we could be talking about my biases and my proclivity to scare monger,

146
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:25,330
and you know fair enough but here's some reasons we're not and one is that I have all those lectures online and

147
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:33,836
You know believe me if there would have been a phrase in any of them that indicated that there was something even vaguely morally corrupt about me.

148
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:36,187
It would have been paraded around as evidence.

149
00:14:36,187 --> 00:14:38,686
You can be sure of that, so that's kind of a relief

150
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:44,750
you know, I did a lot of soul-searching in the last couple of months and it's not like I'm without my problems,

151
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,850
but anyways, so what is this about?

152
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:56,530
well we'll say hopefully it's not about me because that'd be stupid and so what what's going on?

153
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:04,066
Why are all these people watching these videos these things I made just to figure out what it was that I was thinking

154
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:11,877
because I couldn't sleep one night and because I'm not very damn happy about that unconscious bias stuff, which I regard is absolutely reprehensible

155
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:18,067
that you could be held guilty for your implicit perceptions.

156
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:24,000
Think about that, God, they use that test as a diagnostic test.

157
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,930
You know, it doesn't meet the criteria for reliability and validity that you'd use for a diagnostic test.

158
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:34,010
It doesn't produce the same results one time after another, and you can use it to target anybody.

159
00:15:34,995 --> 00:15:37,829
And so go along with it if you want, and just see what happens.

160
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:44,328
Anyways, so I've been thinking about this, like, what's going on?

161
00:15:44,328 --> 00:15:45,070
Why the outcry?

162
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:49,610
You know you think well professor Peterson got his 15 minutes of fame

163
00:15:49,891 --> 00:15:55,470
it's like I had my 15 minutes of you know, trivial fame several times in my life and

164
00:15:56,355 --> 00:16:01,600
There's some good things about it But I am despite what you might think a rather private person

165
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:08,442
so it's not like I'm particularly enjoying it, but I thought something you know when I made those videos.

166
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:10,670
I thought this is something I learned from reading mythology

167
00:16:11,352 --> 00:16:16,730
if you have to fight a dragon you should go to its lair before it comes to your village

168
00:16:17,513 --> 00:16:20,766
And so people think of what I did is courageous,

169
00:16:20,766 --> 00:16:28,933
and I don't think that's right I just think that I can see danger coming and you get to pick you get to pick your anxiety

170
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:37,430
I could either be anxious about speaking or I could be anxious about not speaking and so I chose to be anxious about speaking

171
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:40,278
And that's not exactly courage.

172
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:44,310
It's more like common sense, but that assumes that you're looking into the future

173
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:52,333
So you might say, well what gives me any special power to look into the future,

174
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,333
and here that's a good question and my god only knows what's going to happen in the next few years.

175
00:16:57,706 --> 00:16:58,690
You know I did read today

176
00:16:59,073 --> 00:16:59,658
This is cool

177
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:07,880
thousand people will be lifted out of absolute poverty today, and three hundred thousand more will be connected to electricity.

178
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:15,788
And we're knocking poverty rates around the world down faster by a huge margin than we ever have in human history.

179
00:17:15,788 --> 00:17:20,648
There was an article in the New York Times today called, Why 2016 Was the Best Year Ever.

180
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:21,752
It's really worth reading.

181
00:17:21,752 --> 00:17:23,379
I concluded the same thing.

182
00:17:23,379 --> 00:17:28,605
I worked for a UN committee a couple of years ago and I was looking at, you know, what was going to happen down the road.

183
00:17:28,605 --> 00:17:32,340
And everything I I kept reading was well, wow, we're getting rid of polio.

184
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,654
We're getting rid of elephantiasis, which you really don't want to have We're getting rid of Guinea worm.

185
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:38,119
We're getting rid of polio.

186
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:43,500
We're knocking malaria back into the swamps from where it comes we're lifting people out of poverty.

187
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,909
It's like man, we're doing a lot of good things You'd sure never guess that by the way, we treat ourselves

188
00:17:49,331 --> 00:17:52,279
So anyways, so what's going on?

189
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,485
Okay, so I thought well I better think about this.

190
00:17:54,485 --> 00:17:56,090
I've been thinking about a long time.

191
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:03,200
So So, you know, the right wing is really hard on the Frankfurt School, you know, on the Frankfurt School,

192
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:11,733
where these kind of neo-Marxist guys who combined Marxism with Freudianism in the 1940s,

193
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:16,048
and they weren't avowed neo-Marxists, you know, so it's not like I'm making an accusation.

194
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,966
And they were kind of anti-system type people,

195
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:26,791
and all of that, but I think to lay what's happening at the universities and in brought at in the broader culture itself

196
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:30,000
at the feet of the Frankfurt School is insufficient

197
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,700
I really think that it's primarily a consequence of the French intellectuals

198
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:40,266
who and this is obviously an oversimplification who emerged out of Marxism in the early 1970s

199
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:48,000
and produced post-modernism now the thing about the post-modernist types is they're nested inside Marxism

200
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:57,400
they say that straight out I'm not inventing this you read Derrida, who's like the the Joker at the at the head of the postmodernist movement

201
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:05,400
and I mean Joker because he's he's he's an intellectual clown and that doesn't mean he's stupid, because he is not stupid not at all

202
00:19:05,466 --> 00:19:08,500
these people are not stupid they know exactly what they're doing

203
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,266
they know precisely what they're doing they're a hell of a lot more educated about what they're doing than you are,

204
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:16,900
unless you happen to be one of them and they mean exactly what they say

205
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,100
just like people always do when they tell you what they're going to do or they write it down.

206
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,325
And they say straight out on their websites,

207
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,627
say the women's studies websites,

208
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:31,968
we think the patriarchy is an oppressive structure that should be broken down to its core.

209
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,106
And they mean core conceptions.

210
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:36,049
It's not just social.

211
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,107
It's linguistic, philosophical, and attitudinal.

212
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,005
It should be broken down, wiped out,

213
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,749
and restructured from the bottom up.

214
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,862
And they mean that.

215
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:54,066
So when it's not accidental any of this and I know it sounds like a bloody paranoid conspiracy theory but you know,

216
00:19:54,066 --> 00:20:05,300
I've always been of the idea especially from reading young that ideas people don't have ideas ideas have people and these are powerful ideas

217
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:11,966
There's a good book called explaining post-modernism that I might recommend by a guy named named Stephen RC Hicks

218
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:17,466
and his first chapter which isn't very long is a good introduction to political correctness,

219
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:22,684
but so why do I think this is about about that?

220
00:20:22,684 --> 00:20:26,700
Well, here's my reasons I mean, it doesn't seem to be about me

221
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,933
I think all I did actually was actually I made the general specific

222
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:35,271
Okay, which is kind of what you have to do if you really want to make a point a point

223
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:35,512
Right.

224
00:20:35,512 --> 00:20:40,910
That's one place if you want to make a point and my point was I'm not saying made-up words

225
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:47,500
generated by postmodern neo-Marxists because I despise everything they stand for

226
00:20:47,500 --> 00:21:00,700
and so I'm not using those damn words and that's that and it's it's not like I have something against transgender people

227
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,200
I'm sure some of them are lovely people and some of them aren't

228
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,366
and so they can do whatever they want as far as I'm concerned as long as they don't

229
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:12,600
they can do whatever they want as far as I'm concerned,

230
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,066
as long as I'm not forced to go along with the most radical representatives of them who don't even speak for them.

231
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:28,805
Anyways, I've got like 20 letters from transsexual people supporting what I've done, and like none opposing it.

232
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,706
You know, one of the things that's kind of cool is I've only got three hate letters.

233
00:21:33,571 --> 00:21:34,221
I thought three?

234
00:21:34,911 --> 00:21:46,133
Jesus, you guys aren't trying very hard and I've got like a thousand letters of support

235
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:52,800
and if you go on YouTube where I'm radically overrepresented and you look at the comments

236
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:58,566
and the likes and the dislikes it's about the same ratio it's like likes to dislikes is like about a hundred to one

237
00:21:58,566 --> 00:22:04,866
and almost all the comments are positive which you know could easily be a selection bias and probably is

238
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:13,930
but you know it still means that there's quite a a few people who think that what I'm doing is sort of okay as far as they're concerned, and so that's important.

239
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:18,210
So anyways, we need to talk a little bit about postmodernism.

240
00:22:18,391 --> 00:22:21,845
Okay, so let's go back to France in the 19, end of the 1960s.

241
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,570
So, and this is of course an oversimplification, and I'm sure I'm wrong about some of it, because

242
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:31,825
you know, it's not exactly my field of speciality, this sort of sociology.

243
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:39,700
I'm more of the scientist type, but... and if I read philosophy, I tend not to read second-rate philosophy,

244
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,370
and so I've tried to avoid the postmodernists to some degree,

245
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:48,750
because their ncoherency is one of the least of their sins, but they don't care about that.

246
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:55,906
No, no, you've got to understand, man, that it's modernists and Enlightenment people and even traditionalists who care about coherency.

247
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,438
The postmodernists don't believe in coherency, they don't believe in... and I'm not making this up.

248
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,150
This is part of their philosophy.

249
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,261
They don't believe in logic.

250
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:13,769
You know, Derrida says straight out that Western society is phallo-logo-centric, by which he means male-centered and privileging the idea of logic.

251
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,389
Well, he doesn't buy any of that.

252
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,586
He doesn't think that there's a truth that's out there.

253
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,809
He doesn't believe that individuals can reach any sort of truth by thinking.

254
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:27,423
He certainly doesn't believe that we can move towards truth in dialogue, because that's dialogic, right?

255
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:28,668
There's none of that.

256
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:34,026
well, why don't the, why do the postmodern types keep other thinkers off the campus?

257
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:35,270
Well, it's not because they're afraid.

258
00:23:36,372 --> 00:23:45,122
Well, although some of them are, but they use their fragility as a mask for their, you know, the underlying philosophical, their underlying philosophical and political interests.

259
00:23:45,122 --> 00:23:46,567
They do that fragmentarily.

260
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:50,350
It's not like every social justice warrior is a, you know,

261
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:58,350
sword-carrying postmodernist, but the ideas are fragmented and distributed among them like they're distributed among a mob.

262
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:06,970
And if you put the whole mob together, you get the whole post-modernist thing happening at the same time, and that's how ideas have people, instead of the other way around.

263
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:11,464
Anyways, forget about logic.

264
00:24:11,464 --> 00:24:12,250
That's out the window.

265
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:19,370
That's just a construct of Western society, and the whole point of the construct was to oppress other people, and to take their wealth,

266
00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:31,668
and to privilege the people who live within that so-called logic system, so that they can justify to themselves and other people their their predator rapaciousness, straight and simple.

267
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,409
And that's partly because postmodernism was influenced by Marxism.

268
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,286
And of course, that's what the Marxists think about.

269
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,467
Any situation where there's a,

270
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:46,322
let's call it a power status differential, the people at the top are only there because they've stole everything from the people at the bottom.

271
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,508
And so the Marxists in France realized

272
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,858
by the end of 1960s thereabouts

273
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,029
when even Jean-Paul Sartre finally figured out

274
00:24:56,311 --> 00:25:04,421
to be a communist probably wasn't acceptable given that the bloody Soviets had killed like 30 million people between 1919 and 1959 and the Maoists

275
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:15,800
had done the same thing on a greater scale in China and then talk about North Korea and we can talk about……

276
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,800
students don't learn any of that in school anymore and even if they did they wouldn't want to listen to it

277
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:23,000
when I tell my students in my second year psychology class about the Gulag archipelago hardly any of them know

278
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:35,051
well why is that well it's because they haven't been taught it why is that well

279
00:25:35,051 --> 00:25:46,170
see if you can figure it out all right so so anyways back to the postmodern types so you know it got to the point where there's just no way you

280
00:25:46,451 --> 00:25:48,500
could be a Marxist especially after Solzhenitsyn

281
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:54,500
because Solzhenitsyn wrote this great book which is actually out of print for crying out loud

282
00:25:54,500 --> 00:26:00,200
which I've actually been able to popularize like mad over the last three months which is you know really mind-boggling

283
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,700
and what Solzhenitsyn did in his genius manner

284
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:12,200
because he's up there with Dostoevsky and Tolstoy like man that guy he's a towering intellect and a person of spectacular moral force

285
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,866
you know like he put himself on the line for that book he memorized it when he was in the in the prison camps

286
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:24,300
it's about it's three volumes that thick you know it's like 2,000 pages of

287
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:34,370
someone screaming the smartest person you've ever met the wisest person you've ever met screaming in outrage for 2,000 pages

288
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:43,550
it's no bloody wonder it's out of print anyways what Solzhenitsyn did was take on this

289
00:26:43,992 --> 00:26:48,969
you often hear the radical leftists make about communism, about Marxism.

290
00:26:48,969 --> 00:26:51,578
They say, well that wasn't real Marxism.

291
00:26:51,578 --> 00:26:56,858
It's like, okay, well how many countries do you need to disprove your thesis?

292
00:26:56,858 --> 00:27:02,262
How many millions of people have to die before you might admit that you're wrong?

293
00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:04,190
Well, obviously more than a hundred million

294
00:27:04,491 --> 00:27:09,100
because that's the approximate total, that's probably an underestimate,

295
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:15,058
but we'll be conservative because adding another 10 million doesn't really make that much difference.

296
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:23,069
So Solzhenitsyn took that argument apart, partly in his book Lenin in Zurich and then partly in the Gulag Archipelago book.

297
00:27:23,069 --> 00:27:27,900
Groundwork had already been laid for all that by Nietzsche who knew exactly what was coming in the 20th century

298
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,733
and by Dostoevsky who wrote a book called The Possessed back in like 1880

299
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:38,606
where he outlined in painful detail the precise mindset that would produce the Russian Revolution like 30 years later.

300
00:27:38,606 --> 00:27:39,510
Amazing.

301
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:42,399
Tolstoy, as well, he knew what was coming.

302
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,664
It made him suicidal.

303
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:45,630
He wrote in his confession that when

304
00:27:47,252 --> 00:27:51,010
that the conflict between the ideas of Russia, the traditional ideas, and the

305
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:57,900
Enlightenment ideas sweeping in from the West, they blew his worldview apart, which was traditional religious,

306
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,272
blew his worldview apart so badly that he was suicidal at the height of his fame.

307
00:28:02,272 --> 00:28:03,950
Tolstoy knew what was going to come, too.

308
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:08,250
And so it's not like Solzhenitsyn was the only person who could see this, Orwell knew it.

309
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:13,670
Malcolm Muggeridge knew it in the 1930s when he was noting that the Soviets

310
00:28:14,353 --> 00:28:21,000
given their idea of class guilt which sounds a lot like white privilege to me or any other form of racism

311
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:29,766
they used that doctrine to just round up all the kulaks they were the productive farmers and ship them off to Siberia

312
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:40,766
and then six million Ukrainians starved to death but you know they had too many Ukrainians anyway so it didn't really matter, so anyways back to the postmodern types well

313
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:44,900
you know this all came was revealed in such painful detail

314
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,766
that even the kind of closed-minded ideologue that Norman referred to just quite couldn't couldn't quite muster up the moral courage to keep beaten the same damn drum

315
00:28:55,151 --> 00:29:02,533
so what they did instead being highly intelligent individuals was play a game of sleight of hand

316
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:06,766
and transformed these Marxist presuppositions into post-modernism in the 1970s

317
00:29:06,766 --> 00:29:12,333
and the idea basically was well the working class isn't going to rise up and crush the bourgeoisie

318
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,766
because first of all they're getting rich and that wasn't supposed to happen

319
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:19,566
and second well it sort of seemed to be a catastrophe when that occurred let's say in Russia

320
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:24,100
and so maybe we won't do that anymore because the working class actually isn't buying into this either

321
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:32,166
which is also a problem having internalized their own oppression they wouldn't buy into this to the global myth of utopia

322
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:36,951
so maybe it's because they had some sense it's certainly possible but anyways the sleight of hand was

323
00:29:36,951 --> 00:29:42,066
oh well fine we'll just play a different oppressor versus oppressed game

324
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:48,500
and we'll introduce identity politics it's like okay okay you're not being oppressed

325
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:53,900
because you remember the working class you're being oppressed because you're a woman or you're being oppressed

326
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,000
because you have an ethnicity that's outside the main paradigm whatever that might be

327
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:03,990
or it's because of your sexual preference or your sexual identity

328
00:30:04,432 --> 00:30:10,200
whatever places you in some manner outside the normative culture

329
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,900
and you know the thing is the postmodernist

330
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,766
you might think well your culture is good for something it gives you a hierarchy of value

331
00:30:15,766 --> 00:30:19,900
it rewards competent people it gives you a direction so you can climb up

332
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:24,400
because otherwise everything's leveled to nothing and then why do anything they don't care about any of that,

333
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,900
they don't believe that there's any such thing as competence, they don't believe that there's any such thing as up.

334
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,246
This is all, postmodernism wipes all of that out.

335
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:39,666
And so when the postmodernists analyze a text, all they care about is how it privileges the position of the author and who it impresses.

336
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:45,000
And that's the only thing they regard as real, and they don't believe in grand unifying narratives,

337
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,966
they don't believe that there's a Canadian identity, they don't believe that there's an American identity,

338
00:30:48,966 --> 00:30:51,100
they don't believe that there's a Western identity,

339
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:56,905
they don't believe Value structures exist or if they are they're irreplaceable with some other value structure.

340
00:30:56,905 --> 00:31:04,811
They certainly don't believe that they have any biological grounding that there's any such thing as a human being it's all socially constructed

341
00:31:04,811 --> 00:31:10,070
which is really convenient if what you want to do is be the author of an entirely social constructed

342
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:15,410
Utopia that you can run and then when the Marxists say well that wasn't real Marxism

343
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:19,266
what it really means and I've thought about this for a long time

344
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:25,933
It's the most arrogant possible statement anyone could ever make it means if I would have been in Stalin's position

345
00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:32,050
I would have ushered in the damn utopia instead that instead of the genocidal massacres

346
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:35,742
because I understand the doctrine of Marxism and everything about me is good.

347
00:31:35,742 --> 00:31:37,950
It's like well think again sunshine

348
00:31:38,536 --> 00:31:39,589
You don't understand it

349
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:47,730
You don't understand it and you're not that good and that the power was in your hands assuming you had the competence which you don't

350
00:31:49,293 --> 00:31:51,766
You wouldn't have done any better, and even if you had,

351
00:31:51,766 --> 00:31:57,991
there would have been someone else waiting right behind you to shoot you the first time you actually tried to do anything good.

352
00:31:57,991 --> 00:32:01,659
And that's what happened to all the old guard who ran the damn revolution.

353
00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:06,409
Stalin rounded them all up and shot them, along with their families and millions of other people.

354
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:12,290
So even if you do happen to be that avatar of moral purity that you claim implicitly,

355
00:32:12,691 --> 00:32:19,309
the probability that you'd get to act out your goodness in relationship to those possessed by your ideology is zero.

356
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:21,387
So it's just...

357
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:32,759
So, you know, you think, well, why are these postmodernists doing what they're doing?

358
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,260
Why do they oppose the patriarchy?

359
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,747
Here's a question.

360
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:38,360
Why don't the feminists complain about Saudi Arabia?

361
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:53,800
It's like, you know, Gad Saad, who's this guy at Concordia who is in a business school so he can actually say what he thinks now and then,

362
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,960
he tweeted yesterday, well, he tweeted to the Women's March,

363
00:32:57,966 --> 00:33:01,333
because there's a little Twitter thing, you could do that, I suppose, for the organizers,

364
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:08,533
and he said, why don't you go to the Middle East and have a nice march against Saudi Arabia and see, see how that works out for you.

365
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:11,409
It's like, so you think, well, why not?

366
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,182
Like why not?

367
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:16,827
Why are the why are there radical leftists who are so much for rights everywhere?

368
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:17,590
That's what they say

369
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:27,210
Why aren't they complaining about Saudi Arabia, for example, which you know breeds a particularly pathological form of ideologically rigid Islam

370
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:30,843
that basically enslaves their women that's to put it properly.

371
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:32,610
It's like why not complain about that?

372
00:33:32,831 --> 00:33:36,490
Well, how about this the enemy of my enemy is my friend

373
00:33:38,035 --> 00:33:43,743
and so when push comes to shove, you see how much concern there is among the radical feminists for the rights of women.

374
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:52,000
It's like if the pushing those rights forward doesn't also at the same time undermine the Western patriarchy,

375
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,761
then we'll take the undermining and leave the damn rights behind.

376
00:33:56,532 --> 00:34:00,717
And so there's an insight for you about exactly what's going on at the bottom of all this.

377
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:08,450
So okay, so then there's another weird thing, and I've already sort of hit on it tangentially.

378
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,933
It's like, well, the postmodernists don't believe in grand unifying narratives,

379
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:20,550
they don't believe in narratives at all, they don't care about value, because they never noticed that you have to value something in order to have some hope in life, right?

380
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:28,668
Because when you value something, you're pursuing it, and in the pursuit, that's where the meaning in life is, you know, because the rest of it's suffering.

381
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:36,929
If you're trying to struggle upwards towards the light, it's like, well, that's something to motivate you and to protect you against the suffering.

382
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:42,318
But the postmodernists don't care about any of that, and I would say it's because they don't care about suffering.

383
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:48,670
So all right, so here, but here's the, here's the final question.

384
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:54,766
It's like, well, if the postmodernists don't care about grand unifying narratives and they don't believe in identity,

385
00:34:54,766 --> 00:35:02,350
why in the world are they willing to believe in gender identity and sexual identity and racial identity and ethnic identity.

386
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,687
And the answer to that is, well, they can't.

387
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:08,007
But they don't care, because coherence isn't on their agenda.

388
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:14,900
And besides that, when push comes to shove, their postmodernism is nested inside a deeper Marxism,

389
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:21,866
and so when the postmodern narrative doesn't suffice, say, to push forward the idea that Western civilization should be overturned,

390
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:25,466
they just revert back to the overarching Marxism and say well those people are oppressed and that's a bad thing

391
00:35:25,466 --> 00:35:32,533
it's like you might say, well you're a post-modernist it's like you don't believe in any of that

392
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:35,566
they say, well yeah I'm only a post-modernist this deep

393
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:40,500
but underneath that there's a Marxism and I can always rely on that to fill in the gaps

394
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:48,066
and that's exactly what's happening so so that's what's happening as far as I can tell

395
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:52,200
and you know so why do I believe this well there's a little war going on in our culture

396
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,966
maybe it's not so little I put my finger on it and I wouldn't recommend that by the way

397
00:35:56,966 --> 00:36:04,466
because okay you explain it man you explain why like three million people have watched the U of T free speech rally

398
00:36:04,466 --> 00:36:08,533
and I think seven million people downloaded the Jill Rogan podcast

399
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:15,566
and it's like crazy it's crazy there was a hundred and eighty newspaper articles about this it was news for four months

400
00:36:15,566 --> 00:36:21,166
why who cares what I think god I don't I don't even care that much about what I think.

401
00:36:27,759 --> 00:36:28,500
What about Trump?

402
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,459
What's going on there?

403
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,055
What's going on there, exactly?

404
00:36:33,305 --> 00:36:37,520
You know, it was interesting listening to Trump's inauguration speech, because

405
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:41,338
I detected elements of National Socialist thought in it.

406
00:36:41,762 --> 00:36:43,520
You know, I'm not being dismissive.

407
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,480
I'm seriously not being dismissive.

408
00:36:46,207 --> 00:36:49,500
But, when you radically activate on the side of the left,

409
00:36:49,782 --> 00:36:52,520
you call forth compensatory forces.

410
00:36:53,182 --> 00:36:57,254
And they're not in your control and like Trump opened his speech you just read it.

411
00:36:57,254 --> 00:36:58,257
It's he sounds like a 1950 socialist

412
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,820
You know he's gonna use the power of the state to bring the industry home to produce a lot of infrastructure

413
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:09,840
It's a state business unity with the state in charge, and then at the end of his speech

414
00:37:10,142 --> 00:37:17,566
Which is where he stops being at least the international kind of socialist He says well borders are really important and so is national identity

415
00:37:17,566 --> 00:37:26,621
he does embed that it within belief in God which is probably a good thing assuming that he's serious about that,

416
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:29,000
but the fact that Trump was elected in the end that there was such a fight between him and the Clintonites

417
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,600
and that the Clintonites were playing identity politics instead of speaking for the working class who then Trump co-opted like he should have

418
00:37:40,202 --> 00:37:43,160
There there's a war going on there, and then well what about Brexit?

419
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,540
What's going on there, and what about France with Marine Le Pen and what about Holland with Wilders?

420
00:37:48,964 --> 00:37:55,660
You know watch it We're in a chaotic time and you know I've got letters from people all over the world

421
00:37:55,666 --> 00:38:01,066
who tell me how they can't say what they think it's like Oh, well, that's not very good and they're kind of happy with me

422
00:38:01,066 --> 00:38:06,260
because maybe they think that I emboldened them in some way And so good good for that

423
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:12,533
Hypothetically and most of the people who wrote me the overwhelming majority were reasonable So pretty happy about that too,

424
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:16,300
but and maybe I'm wrong about my damn diagnosis because like what do I know?

425
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,338
I know, but I do have this proclivity to get to the bottom of things.

426
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,889
And what's at the bottom of this is an ideological war, or a philosophical war, it's even deeper than that.

427
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:32,016
It might even be deeper than a philosophical war, which is something that's more like a metaphysical or a theological war.

428
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:37,064
You know, it depends on how far down you look, and the postmodernists know exactly what they're doing.

429
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,676
This isn't accidental.

430
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,200
Of course you shut down speakers you don't agree with, because you can't have a dialogue with a man anyways,

431
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,366
because human beings can't have dialogue.

432
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,059
There's no such thing as a human individual.

433
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,454
There's no such thing as truth.

434
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,190
Here's the postmodern world.

435
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,816
It's the Hobbesian nightmare.

436
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,077
It's everyone against everyone else, except it's not individuals, it's groups.

437
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,579
And you're stuck in your damn group, and it's the only thing about you anyways that's relevant,

438
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,856
which is why we might base our hiring on it, for example.

439
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,733
And you're oppressed, and even if you don't know it, it's only because you've internalized it,

440
00:39:09,733 --> 00:39:12,066
and it's the only thing that's real about you anyways.

441
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:16,659
And I can't talk to you because I'm in my own little silo of privileged belief.

442
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,659
And besides, we can't use logic because that doesn't exist.

443
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:23,535
And so you're in a group, and I'm in a group, and all we can do is have a war.

444
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:30,193
Or we can talk, but we don't get to talk, because you can't talk if you're a postmodernist, because speech is just chatter.

445
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:35,159
So it's just chatter that supports the people in power.

446
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,216
That's how they think.

447
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:43,590
So the whole world is this little armed war of identity group against identity group against identity group.

448
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:48,915
And you shut down people who don't agree with you because why should you let them talk?

449
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,034
You don't believe in any of the reasons why you would let someone talk.

450
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,598
So this isn't accidental.

451
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,817
It's not because they're afraid, although it's also because of that.

452
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,179
They hijack, you know, fear.

453
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,759
They hijack compassion.

454
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:12,200
They make anyone who puts forward an alternative view into a terrorist of ideas, and someone who's heartless at the core,

455
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,340
which is really incredibly intelligent, it's such a good strategy.

456
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:23,218
It's so devious and brilliant, and it's so effective, because who the hell wants to be labeled a bigot?

457
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,955
You probably are a damn bigot, just like everyone else.

458
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,791
So you know, when it's easy to make people feel guilty about that, maybe they should.

459
00:40:34,021 --> 00:40:39,566
anyways what's going on well that's what's going on and so what do you do about it

460
00:40:39,566 --> 00:40:44,733
well I don't know what you do about it but I have a theory and that's one I've been working on for like 40 years

461
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:52,666
so one of the problems with post-modernism and I'm gonna take five minutes and then we're done one of the problems with post-modernism is that

462
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:57,366
and this is a big problem like this is a fatal problem apart from the fact that it's incoherent

463
00:40:57,366 --> 00:40:58,900
and there's no value structure in it and it's fundamentally divisive and destructive there's a a logical problem with it, too, that's even worse.

464
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:09,018
And so you might be noticing that the LGBT set of acronyms keeps growing, eh?

465
00:41:10,204 --> 00:41:13,420
And it's kind of a form of its own parody in some sense.

466
00:41:13,502 --> 00:41:14,400
It's like, well, I'm oppressed.

467
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:15,674
It's like, yeah, yeah, you are.

468
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,438
And well, I'm oppressed, too.

469
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:23,919
Yeah, you're also oppressed, and maybe I'm even impressing you being part of this other marginalized group, but at least we share our oppression.

470
00:41:24,162 --> 00:41:25,300
Well, I'm also oppressed.

471
00:41:25,502 --> 00:41:27,035
Well, so am I. I'm oppressed, too.

472
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,619
It's like, okay, so here's a problem.

473
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,306
a big problem here.

474
00:41:32,306 --> 00:41:34,575
The problem is it's true.

475
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,368
You're oppressed, you're oppressed, you're oppressed, you're oppressed.

476
00:41:37,368 --> 00:41:38,835
God only knows why.

477
00:41:38,835 --> 00:41:45,100
Maybe you're too short or you're not as beautiful as you could be or, you know, your parent, your grandparent was a serf, likely,

478
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,601
because almost everybody's grand, great grandparent was.

479
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:54,533
It's like, you know, and you're not as smart as you could be and you have a sick relative and you have your own physical problems

480
00:41:54,533 --> 00:41:58,866
and it's like, frankly, you're a mess and you're oppressed in every possible way,

481
00:41:58,866 --> 00:42:10,600
including your ancestry and your biology and the entire sum of human history has conspired to produce victimized you with all your individual pathological problems

482
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:17,200
it's like yes true okay but the problem is is that it is true

483
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,800
and so if you take the oppressed you have to fractionate them and fractionate them

484
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,366
it's like you're a woman yeah

485
00:42:22,366 --> 00:42:23,733
okay well I'm a black woman

486
00:42:23,733 --> 00:42:25,933
well I'm a black woman who has two children

487
00:42:25,966 --> 00:42:30,500
well I'm a black woman who has two children and one of them isn't very Healthy and then well,

488
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:34,933
I'm a I'm a Hispanic woman and I have a genius son who doesn't have any money

489
00:42:34,933 --> 00:42:36,733
So that he can't go to university and you know,

490
00:42:36,733 --> 00:42:41,628
I had a hell of a time getting across the border It was really hard on me to get my citizenship.

491
00:42:41,628 --> 00:42:43,374
My husband is an alcoholic brute.

492
00:42:43,374 --> 00:42:45,280
It's like well, yeah, that sucks, too

493
00:42:45,902 --> 00:42:50,640
And so well, so let's let's let's fix all your oppressive oppression

494
00:42:51,163 --> 00:42:56,086
And we'll take every single thing into account and then we'll fix yours, too We'll take every single thing into account.

495
00:42:56,086 --> 00:43:00,660
It's like no you won't because you can't you can't it is

496
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:06,397
Technically impossible first of all you can't even list all the ways that you're oppressed second.

497
00:43:06,397 --> 00:43:07,380
How are you gonna weight them?

498
00:43:08,501 --> 00:43:13,115
Third who's gonna decide and that's the bloody thing who's gonna decide.

499
00:43:13,115 --> 00:43:18,031
That's the thing well What's the answer in the West it's like in free markets?

500
00:43:18,031 --> 00:43:18,111
Oh?

501
00:43:18,111 --> 00:43:22,015
Yeah, Christ will never be able to solve this problem And no one can solve it.

502
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,475
What are we going to do about that?

503
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,576
We're going to outsource it to the marketplace.

504
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:31,855
You're going to take your sorry, pathetic being, and you're going to try to offer me something that maybe I want.

505
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:38,157
And I'm going to take my sorry, pathetic being, and I'm going to say, well, all things considered,

506
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:45,334
as well as I can understand them, maybe I could give you this much money, which is actually a promise, for that thing.

507
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,775
And you've packed all of your damn oppression into the price.

508
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,418
And I've packed all my oppression into the willingness to pay it.

509
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,174
And that solution sucks.

510
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,895
It's a bad solution.

511
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,737
But compared to every other solution, man, it's why 10% of us have freedom.

512
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:05,319
And so there's a tremendous illogic at the bottom of this.

513
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:11,999
It's like, you have to fractionate the oppressed all the way down to the level of the individual.

514
00:44:12,624 --> 00:44:14,217
Oh, that's what the West figured out.

515
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:19,038
You know, there's a couple of figures who at the mythological roots of our culture and,

516
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,733
know people get upset with me because I bring in religious themes

517
00:44:22,733 --> 00:44:27,333
but I understand some things about mythology and religion it's not an accident that

518
00:44:27,441 --> 00:44:42,159
the axiomatic Western individual is someone who was unfairly nailed to a cross and tortured it's like yes right exactly so what do you do about that

519
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:50,966
well I thought about that for a long time too it's like well you don't get together in a damn Bob

520
00:44:50,966 --> 00:44:57,166
because all that does is allow you to be as horrible as you could possibly imagine and suffer from none of the consequences

521
00:44:57,166 --> 00:45:04,700
that's a bad idea so how about we don't do that well there's a deep idea in the West too

522
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:12,666
It's like pick up your damn suffering and bear it and try to be a good person so you don't make it worse.

523
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,754
Well, that's a truth.

524
00:45:16,754 --> 00:45:22,151
You know, I read a lot about the terrible things that people have done to each other.

525
00:45:22,151 --> 00:45:24,381
You just cannot even imagine it.

526
00:45:24,381 --> 00:45:28,212
It's so awful.

527
00:45:28,212 --> 00:45:29,997
So you don't want to be someone like that.

528
00:45:29,997 --> 00:45:31,723
Now, do you have a reason to be?

529
00:45:31,723 --> 00:45:33,369
Yes!

530
00:45:33,369 --> 00:45:35,256
You have a lots of reasons to be.

531
00:45:35,256 --> 00:45:40,819
God, there's reasons to be resentful about your existence, everyone you know is going to die, you know?

532
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:41,509
You too.

533
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,855
And there's going to be a fair bit of pain along the way, and lots of it's going to be unfair.

534
00:45:46,221 --> 00:45:48,259
It's like, yeah, no wonder you're resentful.

535
00:45:48,742 --> 00:45:50,655
It's like, act it out and see what happens.

536
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,353
You make everything you're complaining about infinitely worse.

537
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,900
There's this idea that hell is a bottomless pit, and that's because no matter how bad it is,

538
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:05,480
some stupid son of a bitch like you could figure out a way to make it a lot worse.

539
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,632
you think, well, what do you do about that?

540
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:10,197
Well, you accept it.

541
00:46:10,197 --> 00:46:11,341
That's what life is like.

542
00:46:11,341 --> 00:46:12,746
It's suffering.

543
00:46:12,746 --> 00:46:16,178
That's what the religious people have always said.

544
00:46:16,178 --> 00:46:16,540
Life is

545
00:46:16,801 --> 00:46:17,744
suffering.

546
00:46:17,744 --> 00:46:18,908
Yes.

547
00:46:18,908 --> 00:46:20,232
Well, who wants to admit that?

548
00:46:20,232 --> 00:46:22,219
Well, just think about it.

549
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:25,730
Well, so what do you do in the face of that suffering?

550
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:28,919
Try to reduce it.

551
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:30,044
Start with yourself.

552
00:46:30,044 --> 00:46:31,009
What good are you?

553
00:46:31,009 --> 00:46:35,666
Get yourself together, for Christ's sake, so that when your father dies you're not whining away in a corner

554
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:37,400
and you can help plan the funeral and you can stand up solidly so that people can rely on you that's

555
00:46:41,601 --> 00:46:50,866
better don't be a damn victim course you're a victim Jesus obviously put yourself together

556
00:46:50,866 --> 00:46:53,700
and then maybe if you put yourself together you know how to do that

557
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:59,200
you know what's wrong with you if you'll admit it you know there's a few things you could like polish up a little bit that

558
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,700
you might even be able to manage in your insufficient present condition

559
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:07,700
and so you might shine yourself up a little bit and then your eyes will be a little more open

560
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,900
then you can shine yourself up a little bit more and then maybe you could bring your family together

561
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:18,000
instead of having them be the hateful spiteful neurotic infighting batch

562
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:28,220
that you're like doomed to spend Christmas with so then you fix yourself up a little bit kind of humbly because you know God you're a fixer-upper

563
00:47:28,542 --> 00:47:31,733
if there ever was one and then you got to figure out

564
00:47:31,733 --> 00:47:34,200
well can you figure out how to make peace with your idiot brother

565
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,533
and probably not because he's just as dumb as you so the how the hell are you gonna manage that

566
00:47:39,533 --> 00:47:43,733
and so then you maybe you get somewhere that way and your family sort of functioning and you find out

567
00:47:43,733 --> 00:47:46,266
well that kind of relieved a little bit of suffering although it reduced the opportunities for spiteful revenge

568
00:47:46,821 --> 00:47:54,733
and that's kind of a pain in the neck and so then you get your family together a little bit

569
00:47:54,733 --> 00:47:57,333
and you're a little clued in then, at least a bit, because you've done something difficult that's actually difficult.

570
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,600
You're a little wiser, and so then maybe you could put a tentative finger out beyond the family

571
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,680
and try to change some little thing without wrecking it.

572
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:13,104
It's like, our society is complex, and we teach our students that they could just fix it.

573
00:48:14,021 --> 00:48:17,719
It's like, go fix a military helicopter and see how far you get with that.

574
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,814
It's like, you know what you're going to do?

575
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,598
You're like a chimp with a wrench.

576
00:48:21,005 --> 00:48:21,311
Whack!

577
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:22,189
Oh, look!

578
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,760
It's better!

579
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:24,880
It's like, no!

580
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,635
It's not better.

581
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,758
Things are complicated.

582
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,936
And to fix things is really hard.

583
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,198
And you have to be like a golden tool to fix things.

584
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,065
And you're not.

585
00:48:35,741 --> 00:48:38,158
So – and that's the other message of the West.

586
00:48:39,064 --> 00:48:40,976
It's like, how do you overcome the suffering of life?

587
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,875
And I'm not saying it's only the message of the West.

588
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,617
How do you overcome the suffering of life?

589
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,949
Be a better person.

590
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:50,913
That's how you do it.

591
00:48:51,643 --> 00:48:55,000
Well, that's hard takes responsibility

592
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:03,666
and I think you said to someone you want to have a meaningful life everything you do matters that's the definition of a meaningful life

593
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:14,466
but everything you do matters you're gonna have to carry that with you or do you want to just forget about the whole meaning thing and then you don't have any responsibility

594
00:49:14,466 --> 00:49:15,700
because who the hell cares and you can wander through life doing whatever you want gratifying impulsive desires for how useful that's going to be.

595
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:26,099
And you're stuck in meaninglessness, but you don't have any responsibility.

596
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,011
Which one do you want?

597
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:31,097
Well, ask yourself, which one are you pursuing?

598
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:40,479
And you'll find very rapidly that it isn't the majority of your soul that's pursuing the whole meaning thing, because, well, look what you have to do to do that.

599
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,600
You have to take on the fact that life is suffering.

600
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,398
You have to put yourself together in the face of that.

601
00:49:47,369 --> 00:49:48,199
Well, that's hard.

602
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:50,540
Christ it's amazing people can even do it

603
00:49:50,963 --> 00:49:53,060
I'm stunned every day when I go outside

604
00:49:54,023 --> 00:50:01,666
And it isn't a riot with everything burning because really God you talk to people it's like I knew this guy

605
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:07,133
he'd been in a motorcycle accident, and it really ruined him and he was like a linesman working on the power

606
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:12,103
and he was working with someone who had Parkinson's disease, and they had complementary inadequate seas

607
00:50:12,103 --> 00:50:19,666
and so two of them could do the job of one person and so they're out there fixing power lines in the freezing cold

608
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:25,566
despite the fact that one was three-quarters wrecked with a motorcycle accident the other one had Parkinson's

609
00:50:25,566 --> 00:50:32,677
it's like that's how our civilization works it's like there's all these ruined people out there they've got problems like you can't believe off

610
00:50:33,682 --> 00:50:40,773
they go to work and do things they don't even like and look the lights are on my my God, it's unbelievable, it's a miracle, it's a miracle.

611
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:47,798
And we're so ungrateful, college students, the post-modern types, they're so ungrateful.

612
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:54,133
You know, they don't know that they're surrounded by just a bloody miracle, it's a miracle that all this stuff works,

613
00:50:54,133 --> 00:51:02,333
that all you crazy chimpanzees that don't know each other can sit in the same room for two hours sweltering away without tearing each other apart,

614
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:14,533
because that's what chimps do so anyways so what happened well I made some videos

615
00:51:14,533 --> 00:51:18,941
and I got to the bottom of some things at least as far as I can tell so I told you what the bottom is

616
00:51:18,941 --> 00:51:25,200
and then I've got this idea about what you might do about it which isn't my idea it's like it's not my idea

617
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,333
it's an old old old old idea it's far older than Christianity

618
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:43,140
it's the oldest story of mankind get yourself together transcend your suffering see if you can be some kind of hero make the suffering in the world less

619
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:50,700
well that's the way forward as far as I can tell if there is any way forward and that's what's under assault by the postmodernists

620
00:51:50,700 --> 00:52:01,666
so look out because they know exactly what they're doing and they know exactly why they're doing it and that's what it looks like to me so that's it
