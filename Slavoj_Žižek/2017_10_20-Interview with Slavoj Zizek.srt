1
00:00:10,421 --> 00:00:10,809
No, we didn't.

2
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:11,770
Oh, yes.

3
00:00:11,831 --> 00:00:12,239
No, no.

4
00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:12,760
No, no, no.

5
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:13,770
I don't worry about it.

6
00:00:13,811 --> 00:00:14,270
It's not like that.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,700
But I'm an obsession neurotic.

8
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,588
No, no. I mean, I'm

9
00:00:17,612 --> 00:00:19,500
an obsession neurotic.

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:21,827
So I worry about others.

11
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,016
Do you have an alarm clock or what?

12
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,186
You see, this is typical of me..

13
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:28,370
I worry about other people

14
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,711
All the time I think I spoke

15
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:32,616
too long so I will ruin

16
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,006
Your child will be there alone

17
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,522
You will not pick him up

18
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:37,158
It will be fine

19
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:40,107
Sorry for the expression

20
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,501
It's necessary, exactly

21
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,128
You will just take some gentle things like that

22
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,330
Don't call me professor if you don't want me to kill you

23
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:56,420
I feel so uneasy when somebody calls me a professor.

24
00:00:58,513 --> 00:00:59,370
You are a professor.

25
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,064
That's my problem.

26
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:03,559
I have deep problems, distrust

27
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:06,370
with any official titles and so on.

28
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:08,107
But I'm not proud of it.

29
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:10,229
It makes life difficult.

30
00:01:10,893 --> 00:01:11,951
I automatically, when somebody

31
00:01:11,975 --> 00:01:14,370
calls me a professor or whatever,

32
00:01:15,455 --> 00:01:18,189
I take it automatically as an irony.

33
00:01:18,814 --> 00:01:20,249
Oh, no, no, but it isn't, but you've earned it.

34
00:01:20,532 --> 00:01:21,097
That's the thing.

35
00:01:21,097 --> 00:01:22,330
It's not like the inherited title.

36
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:23,885
It's not like you're a lord or something.

37
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,606
Look at what Chomsky wrote about me and so on.

38
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,724
I was a little bit hurt.

39
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:31,885
Okay, sorry, I talk too much.

40
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:33,602
No, no, you're doing very well.

41
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:37,979
But the most obvious fact about you is

42
00:01:38,003 --> 00:01:41,370
that you are not just a philosopher,

43
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:42,804
but you're a famous philosopher.

44
00:01:43,511 --> 00:01:44,057
And that's kind of cool.

45
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:45,107
It's a rare thing, right?

46
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:47,370
So I'm going to ask you about the philosopher thing in a bit.

47
00:01:47,952 --> 00:01:50,534
But I would like to find out what does

48
00:01:50,558 --> 00:01:53,069
it mean to you that you're famous?

49
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:55,350
Is fame somehow important?

50
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,956
First, fame is very relative.

51
00:01:56,956 --> 00:02:00,290
I have, as you know, maybe better than me, many enemies.

52
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:04,045
People who think that I'm just a clown, people

53
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:07,330
who think that beneath my amusing nature

54
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:09,819
there is some evil proto-fascist or

55
00:02:09,843 --> 00:02:12,290
Stalinist whatever dimension and so on.

56
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:15,904
So I think my so-called fame

57
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,861
is basically just a way to keep

58
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:22,109
me at a distance, not to engage seriously with what I'm doing.

59
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:25,748
I seriously think, you know, this fame in conversation,

60
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:28,350
as far as I can guess, functions like this.

61
00:02:29,112 --> 00:02:32,029
Oh, he's an interesting guy, don't take him too seriously, but

62
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:34,969
go to one of his talks, you will be amused and so on, you know.

63
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,935
So I'm very proud.

64
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:41,049
What I'm really proud of is that it's not limited to this.

65
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:44,577
For example, you know my crazy book, the

66
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:46,041
length of the Bible,

67
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,230
almost, less than nothing.

68
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:52,129
You know that it sold very well, over 10,000 in

69
00:02:52,153 --> 00:02:55,230
English, in Korea it was reprinted three times.

70
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:55,737
Why?

71
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,260
I don't know, but it gives me hope that

72
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:02,708
nonetheless don't underestimate the public.

73
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,338
The publishers themselves, now they are putting pressure on

74
00:03:06,362 --> 00:03:08,561
me, why don't you write a nice

75
00:03:08,585 --> 00:03:09,310
bestseller on Donald Trump?

76
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,955
Why should I?

77
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:13,183
He's not interesting at all as a person.

78
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:15,370
He's a boring idiot and so on.

79
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,750
But are you worried about your books

80
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:19,370
becoming sort of coffee table books?

81
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,370
You know, people buy them, but they don't actually read them?

82
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:26,330
Oh, I am with, but there is a big philosophical tradition.

83
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,209
Now you started another topic that interests me.

84
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,370
You know that they are not, I wouldn't say coffee table book,

85
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,330
but I will characterize them as big bestsellers classics.

86
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,549
People buy them, nobody really reads them.

87
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,599
And I will give you a list.

88
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,468
John Rawls, a theory of justice.

89
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,988
I know in New York people who wrote a book on Rawls

90
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,087
and privately they admitted to me they didn't read the book.

91
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,147
And I think they are right because unfortunately Rawls,

92
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,057
the way he writes, you really can condense it

93
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:03,328
into like 50 pages and you don't lose a lot.

94
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,110
Habermas, theory of communicative action.

95
00:04:06,772 --> 00:04:07,836
It's mega.

96
00:04:07,836 --> 00:04:08,879
Let's go on.

97
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,513
He's my friend, although right-winger,

98
00:04:10,537 --> 00:04:12,170
but he's provocative, I like him.

99
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:14,720
Peter Sloterdijk, his spheres.

100
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,748
Do you think people really read them?

101
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:22,367
And Robert Brandon, making it explicit.

102
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,685
All these are famous books reprinted all the time.

103
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:28,989
People don't read them.

104
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:32,550
And I have some suspicions that it's

105
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:35,170
up to a point similar even with Hegel.

106
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:38,609
phenomenology maybe, but with logic you

107
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:41,690
know I have doubts if people really read

108
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,055
but in a way I don't think it matters,

109
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,589
here is my I claim Hegelian view

110
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:53,010
did you read a wonderful book by a French author now it's translated

111
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:56,744
Pierre Bayard it's called how to talk

112
00:04:56,768 --> 00:04:59,970
about books that you haven't read

113
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,715
and the beauty is that in the best

114
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:04,588
French style, it's not just irony.

115
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,267
He takes it seriously

116
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,417
and proves precisely

117
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,490
apropos of Joyce and some others that

118
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,243
the best books on certain authors, because

119
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:16,809
he went to check it out with authors,

120
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,936
I mean who wrote about this writer, are

121
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,349
written by guys who didn't read all of it.

122
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,819
He goes through sex with people who don't, sometimes,

123
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:29,410
and that's a deep dialectical Hegelian view

124
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,998
heaven is not a holist in the sense you have to

125
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:36,469
know all aspects, no the art of dialectics is

126
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,598
the right violent abstract you say

127
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:43,350
ignore all that focus on one feature

128
00:05:43,374 --> 00:05:47,780
and then let this one feature color your entire approach

129
00:05:47,804 --> 00:05:52,129
this is the only way to produce something really new

130
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,020
I claim that's the paradox of philosophies you don't have

131
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:59,474
to read it all if you know too much you just get confused.

132
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:01,980
But what about, you know, people buying

133
00:06:02,004 --> 00:06:04,510
your books and perhaps not reading them,

134
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:07,091
do you nonetheless sort of see this as a good sign in the

135
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:09,495
sense that people are kind of interested in philosophy?

136
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:14,036
Yes, because nonetheless my secret hope is that there is

137
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,600
a certain strata of people who are looking for just jokes.

138
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,079
So I got some not exactly hate mail but after this series

139
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:25,432
of my latest more philosophical

140
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:27,410
books like absolute recoil

141
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,687
which if you ask me at a gunpoint I think

142
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:32,510
that's my sorry to say this I even find it to...

143
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,382
...arogan myself my best book absolute

144
00:06:35,406 --> 00:06:37,930
recoil but I got head made like

145
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,348
where are the jokes not enough jokes and so

146
00:06:40,372 --> 00:06:42,730
on yes but you know what's the secret here

147
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:46,805
I will tell you, some people who

148
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:50,582
accused me that behind my vulgar

149
00:06:50,606 --> 00:06:54,945
jokes appearance is that I'm a very traditional even philosopher.

150
00:06:54,945 --> 00:06:58,214
In some sense they are right and my returning to that.

151
00:06:58,214 --> 00:07:02,599
Don't you see that behind all my

152
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:05,973
jokes and so on even the reason

153
00:07:05,997 --> 00:07:11,425
I even use Lacanze is strictly as a means to reinterpret Hegel.

154
00:07:11,425 --> 00:07:13,129
I'm very old-fashioned here.

155
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:16,427
My friend, we don't think the same, Robert Pippin,

156
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:19,749
once we talked and came to the same conclusion,

157
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,048
But still, it's very traditional, that still the big thing in

158
00:07:24,072 --> 00:07:27,970
the history of philosophy is Kant Hegel, all these questions.

159
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:30,273
Was the movement come to think that,

160
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:32,990
legitimate, what happened with Hegel is here?

161
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,831
I can see that that's really interesting, especially for

162
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,050
someone who's also interested in the history of philosophy.

163
00:07:38,712 --> 00:07:41,299
Of course, you know, at Philosophy Now we're very

164
00:07:41,323 --> 00:07:43,910
interested in what philosophy can do in our time.

165
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,172
So what do you think philosophy can or should do

166
00:07:46,196 --> 00:07:48,568
in our time, and is Hegel particularly significant?

167
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:50,534
Absolutely.

168
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:53,369
I even, to provoke my Marxist friends,

169
00:07:53,393 --> 00:07:56,690
you know, although I consider myself some

170
00:07:56,714 --> 00:07:59,507
kind of a Marxist, I like to say that

171
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:02,870
the thesis 11 of Feuerbach, for our time,

172
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,573
should be philosophers and others have tried to

173
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:09,248
change to Marxist things in the 20th century.

174
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:12,419
20th century they tried to do it.

175
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,369
What my friend Alain Badiou calls passion of the real.

176
00:08:15,691 --> 00:08:19,389
let's really change things, the result where, to put it mildly,

177
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:23,667
Gulag, Holocaust, not exactly the best.

178
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:28,810
So maybe the time today is to not try to change

179
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:33,329
but step back and precisely to interpret the thing.

180
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:36,510
Because even at this level, would you agree with it?

181
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,968
I think what we need today is a

182
00:08:38,992 --> 00:08:42,309
materialist reversal of Marx back to Hegel.

183
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:45,929
Hegel is, in a subtle way, much more materialist.

184
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,284
You know which Hegel I like?

185
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,224
When he says, you know, one of the most

186
00:08:50,248 --> 00:08:53,286
famous passages from his philosophy of right,

187
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,607
the owl of Minerva takes off in the evening.

188
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,343
But you know that this simple sentence belies the usual claim

189
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:05,343
Hegel was a conservative who in his philosophy of right,

190
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,970
painted almost proto-fascist, how do you

191
00:09:09,994 --> 00:09:12,569
call it, and a state, a picture of society.

192
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:13,650
So what do you think it means?

193
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:15,610
I think it means something different.

194
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:20,309
When Hegel says, a certain social order, historical orders,

195
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,368
can only be grasped when it's time it's over.

196
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:24,507
That's the main, no?

197
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,476
But do you think really Hegel was such an idiot that he didn't

198
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,004
know that the same was called for his philosophy of right?

199
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,487
The message, he doesn't bring in his philosophy

200
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:35,414
of right a system of how

201
00:09:35,438 --> 00:09:37,348
our society should look.

202
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:40,798
He paints a certain work whose

203
00:09:40,822 --> 00:09:42,369
time has passed, and he knew it.

204
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:46,415
But where I think Hegel is actual, so

205
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:47,988
that I don't lose my thread, is here.

206
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,066
Our situation is much more Hegel's than Marx's.

207
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:56,208
Marx still believed in some kind of minimal teleology.

208
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,529
You know, like, we are at the crucial point.

209
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,912
There is a chance, if not necessity, of

210
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,489
proletarian revolution, universal redemption.

211
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:08,616
When Hegel perceived his situation as a

212
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,028
post-revolutionary one, the big event happened,

213
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,478
the French Revolution, in some sense it went

214
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:18,329
wrong, but Hegel is here truly progressive.

215
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,647
The whole problem of his thought, it's not to say the French

216
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:24,469
Revolution was bullshit, let's return to the tradition,

217
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:28,048
but how to repeat it, how to keep, in spite of

218
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:31,409
some catastrophic outcomes, the legacy alive.

219
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:33,997
And I think our situation is the same.

220
00:10:33,997 --> 00:10:37,207
20th century attempts at radical emancipation,

221
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,459
the communism we got there, they failed.

222
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:45,069
The problem is how to keep that legacy alive.

223
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,458
We have to abandon all that Marxist, simple

224
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,829
metaphoric, we are riding the train of history

225
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,286
and there is, you know, I always use these metaphors, ironically.

226
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:58,664
Marxists like to say even if times are dark,

227
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,629
we can see the light at the end of the tunnel.

228
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,448
And you know with which metaphor I always say,

229
00:11:03,851 --> 00:11:08,128
yes, it is the light of another train coming against,

230
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,547
you know, so that's our situation.

231
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,049
And as Hegel knew it, it's open.

232
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,623
We cannot make any plans.

233
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,206
Hegel, this is very Hegelian.

234
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,607
But the light could be anything.

235
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,069
I mean, it doesn't have to be another train.

236
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,810
It could really be the light at the end of the tunnel, couldn't it?

237
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:27,628
Yes, but that's why the beginning is to get rid of false hopes.

238
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,189
Even the left today is mostly,

239
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,248
we have the majority, which I ironically call them this,

240
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,610
is still, after Fukuyama, left Fukuyamaists there most.

241
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,368
They basically accept liberal democracy and some

242
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:46,609
type of capitalism are the only game in town,

243
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:47,826
so let's just get it.

244
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,453
Better, more solidarity, healthcare,

245
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,265
gay marriages, whatever you want.

246
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,387
The big question is, then we have some, the

247
00:11:56,411 --> 00:12:00,610
biggest irony of this is my answer to Fukuyama.

248
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:03,942
Once I met him, I told him this, he laughed, he

249
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:06,796
said, okay, let's say you are right, capitalism won.

250
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,130
But isn't the irony that today, now, the most efficient managers of

251
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:12,768
global capitalism are communists

252
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:15,406
who are still in power, you know?

253
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,457
So I think that we have finally to

254
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:20,328
accept that 20th century is over.

255
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,849
The way we did it in 20th century either social

256
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:26,138
democratic welfare state,

257
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,490
hardline, real socialism

258
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,787
or even more, that's what I hate, this type

259
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:33,828
any dreams which are coming alive now on,

260
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,158
some kind of non-representative direct

261
00:12:37,182 --> 00:12:39,909
democracy, I don't believe in this.

262
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,647
Also isn't that the problem of labour, so when you say capitalism

263
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:44,702
is actually driven by communists

264
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:47,949
who are still best of mind

265
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,110
but there is a problem of labels

266
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:52,082
what do we mean exactly by capitalism

267
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:53,130
which takes many many forms

268
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:54,827
and of course communists

269
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:55,856
who are capitalist aren't

270
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,383
really communists although they are poor themselves

271
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:01,130
In what sense am I still a communist?

272
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:02,948
Just in a very limited sense

273
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:06,848
First, isn't there aren't we today

274
00:13:06,872 --> 00:13:08,009
witnessing a great irony the left,

275
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:10,219
whatever remains of the left

276
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:13,485
obviously is not able to offer an

277
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:19,110
actual feasible global alternative like whenever the leftist protests

278
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,909
I remember when there was Occupy Wall Street

279
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:24,707
I was with them in New York, in Frankfurt

280
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,206
and I insisted on asking them a stupid question

281
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:31,221
What do you want?

282
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,948
I told them, Freud asked the wrong question

283
00:13:34,191 --> 00:13:34,926
Was will das Es？

284
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:36,585
I claimed, what do you want?

285
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,661
What do you want?

286
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:40,888
And nobody gave me the answer

287
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,350
And I think that precisely because they don't know what they want,

288
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,257
the left takes escape into moralism, the accesses

289
00:13:47,281 --> 00:13:50,108
of political correctness and so on and so on.

290
00:13:50,191 --> 00:13:51,887
So my problem is this one.

291
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,494
On the one hand we have all these

292
00:13:54,518 --> 00:13:56,228
protests, which don't have a clear idea.

293
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,248
On the other hand, don't we get clear signs

294
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,830
all around that capitalism, at least the way

295
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,906
we know it, is approaching an end.

296
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,243
Look at our...

297
00:14:08,671 --> 00:14:09,600
We make we can only hope.

298
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,524
Look at economy, sorry, look at ecology.

299
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,318
It's obvious that although capitalism can do

300
00:14:17,342 --> 00:14:20,528
something through taxes, regulation, it's not enough.

301
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,308
When there is a big catastrophe, you need larger actions.

302
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,688
Look at, here I agree with Fukuyama,

303
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,768
look at the dark potentials of biogenetics.

304
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:31,429
Our brains can already be,

305
00:14:31,591 --> 00:14:33,247
and that's the philosophical problem even,

306
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,709
our brains can already be directly wired,

307
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,826
connected with the PC.

308
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:41,104
It gives us magical power.

309
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:41,689
You can really do it.

310
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,868
Do you know that Stephen Hawking no longer needs his finger?

311
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,047
He thinks forward, his wheelchair moves forward.

312
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,587
But at the same time, it goes the other way, right?

313
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,766
I think, for example, this is the thing,

314
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,388
the possibility of directly wiring our brain,

315
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,657
which will change the very basic

316
00:14:58,681 --> 00:15:01,389
definition of what a human being is, maybe.

317
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,468
So, backwards labor, even with the labor of the human being?

318
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,787
With labor, you know what's the problem with the labor?

319
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,369
But also, I was going to ask you,

320
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:08,689
you mentioned political correctness,

321
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,328
which I think is a very interesting issue

322
00:15:10,753 --> 00:15:11,969
so do you think...

323
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,144
No, sorry, just finish that

324
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,368
All I want to say is that

325
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:16,728
I'm sorry, I know I speak too much

326
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,945
All I want to say is that

327
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:21,549
we have a serious financial capital

328
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,064
all this fictitious capital it doesn't

329
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:26,417
help if European banks for example

330
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:28,803
are throwing hundreds of billions of

331
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,188
freshly printed money into the economy

332
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:34,829
most of it gets lost in fictitious capital speculations

333
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:38,068
then we have the problem of refugees and so on

334
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,688
We have all these problems, intellectual property,

335
00:15:41,712 --> 00:15:44,910
if you ask me, capitalism is falling apart here.

336
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,623
Even people like, I despise them, like Mark

337
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:49,095
Zuckerberg, Elon Musk,

338
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:50,829
even they talk about it,

339
00:15:52,053 --> 00:15:54,349
but you know who said the right pessimist thing

340
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:56,669
here, you must know him, it's your fellow, I mean

341
00:15:57,151 --> 00:15:59,389
the German sociologist economist who is

342
00:15:59,413 --> 00:16:01,650
now modest bestseller Wolfgang Streck,

343
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:07,290
he said that something totally unexpected for Marxists happens.

344
00:16:08,772 --> 00:16:11,729
capitalism is clearly approaching its limit

345
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,989
but for marxists this always meant

346
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:17,609
there is another more progressive force waiting to take over

347
00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:20,709
today capitalism is just disintegrating

348
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:22,808
you know, getting into trouble

349
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:26,269
we see that we have to improvise more and more

350
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:29,289
and already we have the first very sad consequence

351
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:30,804
as I always warn

352
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:37,091
a new figure of The ideal country is a country

353
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:41,890
that is fully integrated into the global market

354
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,026
but at the same time ideologically

355
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:47,568
its ethnocentric focus on its culture

356
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:50,129
Even Trump is doing this

357
00:16:50,411 --> 00:16:52,549
That's why Trump gets well with all dictators

358
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,169
His basic deal with Saudi Arabia is

359
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,823
we are part of the same market,

360
00:16:56,847 --> 00:16:58,645
you buy our arms, we buy your oil

361
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:03,009
It doesn't matter what you do to women there is your problem

362
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,996
This logic of partial cultures, China is playing this game, India,

363
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,725
Modi is playing this game, Putin is playing this game and so on.

364
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:17,636
So we are approaching a new world where global market will

365
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:24,670
coexist with a lack of universally accepted emancipatory rules.

366
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:29,149
This is very sad, but to go back to your question, why communism?

367
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,328
Because I think that all the problems that

368
00:17:31,352 --> 00:17:33,330
I enumerated are the problems of commons.

369
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:35,128
Sorry, can I let you stop for one second?

370
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:36,228
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

371
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,269
Because I think the camera sort of keeps wobble.

372
00:17:38,472 --> 00:17:39,023
I'm so sorry.

373
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:39,840
I'm sorry.

374
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:41,166
That's very fine.

375
00:17:41,697 --> 00:17:42,330
Thank you, sorry.

376
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:48,330
What I want to say is, the problems...these are my beautiful dreams.

377
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:50,304
I said something too much, and then

378
00:17:50,328 --> 00:17:53,966
they will jump down this, arrest us all.

379
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,207
You will also be arrested.

380
00:17:56,717 --> 00:17:57,228
Oh, great, okay.

381
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:57,881
Let's go on.

382
00:17:59,052 --> 00:18:02,320
All the problems that I enumerated, I claim, are

383
00:18:02,344 --> 00:18:06,101
ultimately the problems of what Marx called commons.

384
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,977
Some shared substance which shouldn't

385
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:11,268
be privatized left to the markets.

386
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,032
Like ecology is the problem of our natural substance

387
00:18:15,056 --> 00:18:18,219
to what extent we can manipulate it and so on.

388
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,047
Intellectual property is the problem of our intellectual substance.

389
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,847
Biogenetics is the problem of our substance and so on and so on.

390
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,968
In this sense, as I put it once, ironically, communism is

391
00:18:30,992 --> 00:18:33,808
for me not a solution, but

392
00:18:33,832 --> 00:18:35,484
the name of the problem today.

393
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:41,055
We will have to find a solution at that level of how to deal

394
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:45,744
with commons, with our commons outside market relations.

395
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,767
Even my friend who is otherwise despised

396
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,087
as almost neo-fascist, Peter Sloterdijk.

397
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,000
In a chapter of his, I don't know, he writes

398
00:18:54,024 --> 00:18:56,589
even faster than me, although it's unthinkable,

399
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,107
I think it's what happened in the 20th century, his book.

400
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,748
He also comes to the same conclusion.

401
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,047
The era of nation states where the highest ethical value is,

402
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:14,867
are you ready to sacrifice yourself for your country, is over.

403
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,011
We need to make a step for, for example, just

404
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:21,230
imagine this, a friend of mine, Jean-Pierre Dupuy,

405
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:24,960
D-U-P-U-Y, maybe you should interview him, he

406
00:19:24,984 --> 00:19:28,373
is a very intelligent theorist of catastrophes.

407
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:30,464
He told me that he was in Fukushima two days

408
00:19:30,488 --> 00:19:32,579
after that big tsunami and then radiation.

409
00:19:40,351 --> 00:19:42,188
He told me that you know for a couple of hours

410
00:19:42,212 --> 00:19:44,049
the Japanese government was in total panic.

411
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,958
They thought that the radiation will be so strong

412
00:19:47,982 --> 00:19:51,469
that they have to evacuate the entire Tokyo area.

413
00:19:51,972 --> 00:19:52,843
Where would these people go?

414
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,691
The problem in the old days, it would be

415
00:19:55,715 --> 00:19:58,549
invasion, these people invade another country.

416
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,644
Today you can not do it.

417
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,109
We need larger transnational forms of cooperation.

418
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,369
The only way to deal with economy,

419
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,367
the only way to deal with biogenetics.

420
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,788
If just singular states regulate it,

421
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,589
then Chinese, they are doing it already like crazy.

422
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,525
I mean, rich American, you have 20 clinics in suburbs of Shanghai,

423
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,646
where rich Western parents go,

424
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,885
and they manipulate before even it's born, the genes of Europe

425
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:30,030
All I'm saying is that I, first as a good Marxist still,

426
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,228
I'm absolutely not simply against capitalism.

427
00:20:35,771 --> 00:20:37,409
I think capitalism, let's face it,

428
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,488
it's the most dynamic system in the history of humanity.

429
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,089
It brought incredible progress and so on.

430
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,562
That's why, what does this mean?

431
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,644
And this brings me a lot of trouble.

432
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:53,328
I'm absolutely opposed to this bullshit of relying on

433
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:59,469
local indigenous traditions to fight global capitalism.

434
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,507
No, we have to fight it on its own

435
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:03,866
terms with new universal global vision.

436
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,487
Capitalism, that's what my friends don't get it.

437
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:12,327
It began, it's very instructive to study British colonization of India.

438
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,867
It wasn't, you should all become like us.

439
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:17,228
It was, no, you should keep your culture.

440
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,048
You know that under the influence of the British colonizers,

441
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,174
the traditional caste system in 19th century

442
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:27,948
was even reinforced, brought to new life.

443
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:29,427
So I claim that,

444
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,390
and this is why, another paradoxical confusion,

445
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,307
who is my hero, Malcolm X, he saw it.

446
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,307
Malcolm X, you know what X stands for?

447
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,150
We were uprooted, but he saw it clearly

448
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,843
that this X means we have no substantial

449
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:50,086
particular way of life to which we can return.

450
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,285
But he saw something ingenious.

451
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,988
His point was so our African American,

452
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,127
I never liked this term because it's,

453
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,798
it means like Caribbean blacks can say what are

454
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:05,209
we and so on, but okay, the return is not roots.

455
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,027
So let's look for, it's to use this fact

456
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:10,687
that we are deprived of our ethnic substance

457
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,038
as a change of new, even more authentic

458
00:22:13,062 --> 00:22:15,009
universality than that of mine.

459
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,047
So again, my point is, we have to go through capitalism.

460
00:22:20,335 --> 00:22:22,368
No escape back into...

461
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,488
But at the same time, we have to move over,

462
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:28,049
not because I'm a utopian and want more,

463
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,509
but it's clear that capitalism itself is approaching a crisis

464
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,675
in the simple sense that the problems it

465
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:38,543
encounters today, from ecology and so on,

466
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,264
I am here a pessimist in the sense that capitalism

467
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:47,062
will not be over to resolve them in its own terms.

468
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,838
Which is why we get these paradoxes now, I didn't

469
00:22:49,862 --> 00:22:52,081
forget it, I return to your question labor.

470
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,898
Listen, I find it so irrational that people are afraid

471
00:22:55,922 --> 00:22:59,270
of robotization because it will cause unemployment.

472
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:02,648
This should be the best news that we ever heard.

473
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,606
Nobody says, perfect, we will have to work less.

474
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:09,768
No, the automatic assumption is a catastrophe.

475
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,049
We all used to think that in the 1970s we had

476
00:23:12,073 --> 00:23:13,931
all these science fiction stories where all the

477
00:23:13,955 --> 00:23:16,300
machines would eventually do all the work and we

478
00:23:16,324 --> 00:23:18,669
would have a lot of time to control and have fun.

479
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:19,611
It can be done.

480
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:23,628
We live now in an irrational society where we are afraid of

481
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,669
unemployment but those who work, work more and more intensely.

482
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,106
I want to come back to something else because you've

483
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,086
taken us on a really, really interesting journey here.

484
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:36,174
So we started off with Hegel and we started

485
00:23:36,198 --> 00:23:39,201
at a highly theoretical level where he talked

486
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:47,407
about philosophy in that sense and you point

487
00:23:47,431 --> 00:23:50,727
us to real life problems sort of really down

488
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,909
to earth real problems and for me the question still

489
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,737
remains of what is the philosopher meant to do?

490
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,369
Do you look at yourself mainly as a theorist?

491
00:24:01,172 --> 00:24:03,420
But you also talked about your activism.

492
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,768
Is there a connection between theory and practice?

493
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:09,470
You need theory to see where the activism fails.

494
00:24:10,093 --> 00:24:13,369
You need theory to see where the activism fails.

495
00:24:13,992 --> 00:24:15,277
Especially the left theory.

496
00:24:15,277 --> 00:24:18,329
Isn't the whole history of the left, even in the last century,

497
00:24:19,054 --> 00:24:21,470
one big history of catastrophic failures?

498
00:24:21,832 --> 00:24:24,309
Which is why, as I put it somewhere ironically,

499
00:24:25,211 --> 00:24:30,365
The best Marxist books were usually analyses after the effect

500
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:35,370
of why a revolution had to go wrong, Trotsky's analyses.

501
00:24:35,631 --> 00:24:39,092
And isn't it sad that all we get are

502
00:24:39,116 --> 00:24:40,567
excellent analyses of why we lost?

503
00:24:42,395 --> 00:24:45,470
So, I would say, why philosophy?

504
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:48,349
First, because I don't trust practice.

505
00:24:48,732 --> 00:24:51,188
Practice is blind without theory.

506
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,958
We need theory today more than ever, and by theory

507
00:24:55,982 --> 00:25:00,470
I don't mean this type of direct activist theory.

508
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:02,403
Why do we need theory?

509
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,661
But will practice really follow out of theory?

510
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:07,008
Does that really happen, do you think?

511
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:08,777
I mean, do you think as a theorist

512
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:10,007
this is what is going to achieve?

513
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:14,483
I will be very modest here.

514
00:25:14,483 --> 00:25:16,470
It's doubtful if we philosophers, I doubt it,

515
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,958
doubt it, will provide a new platform, political

516
00:25:20,982 --> 00:25:25,090
program, but I follow here Gilles Deleuze,

517
00:25:25,853 --> 00:25:29,307
otherwise I'm not a Deleuzeian, who said something that even more

518
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:31,094
important than to give the right

519
00:25:31,118 --> 00:25:33,381
answers is to raise the right questions.

520
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:36,130
And here philosophy can be of some use.

521
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:40,200
We are dealing with serious problems today.

522
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,029
But what if we should analyse the extent to which

523
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,673
The very way we formulate these problems

524
00:25:47,697 --> 00:25:51,550
doesn't resolve them but reproduce the problems.

525
00:25:51,871 --> 00:25:55,219
And coming back to your question, that's why, for

526
00:25:55,243 --> 00:25:58,590
example, I have doubts about political correctness.

527
00:25:59,272 --> 00:26:01,929
Of course I agree with its goals, no

528
00:26:01,953 --> 00:26:04,610
humiliation against power relations,

529
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,381
but you know what makes me so sad?

530
00:26:07,381 --> 00:26:09,610
And here at least a little bit of philosophy enters.

531
00:26:10,733 --> 00:26:16,910
think about the figure of human being that is silently presupposed by

532
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:22,570
political correctness its obsession with harassment and victimization

533
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:25,259
we are always threatened I look into your

534
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,810
I don't want to choose the lady eyes for

535
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:31,856
two seconds too long visual rape I was

536
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,770
so this division is very sad beneath it

537
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:39,134
the vision is the one of we are all

538
00:26:39,158 --> 00:26:41,410
potential victims and even I think that's

539
00:26:41,531 --> 00:26:43,489
true okay I don't think that's oh my

540
00:26:43,513 --> 00:26:45,470
god you should visit an American campus

541
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:51,050
there and see you know what I already experienced there once I gave a speech

542
00:26:51,872 --> 00:26:56,764
and a lady stood up and said I'm half black and I am

543
00:26:56,788 --> 00:27:02,906
I am a single mother I have AIDS, and you are wrong.

544
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:08,549
It was so tragic that she didn't even have to go into details.

545
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,225
No, you had this logic of...

546
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:12,150
No, but that's abuse, isn't it?

547
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,628
I mean, I think on the whole, political correctness

548
00:27:14,652 --> 00:27:17,109
just tells us that we should adjust our language

549
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:21,726
to the reality of the world world and the prejudices that be.

550
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:25,269
But the way it does it misfires,

551
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:28,328
because for me, the true step beyond

552
00:27:28,352 --> 00:27:31,249
racism is not to change the language.

553
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,166
We would have to go now more into philosophy,

554
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,888
but even to use the same language,

555
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:40,989
but in a different, ironic, non-racist way.

556
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:45,187
Look, for example, my black friends in the United States,

557
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,087
they all provoke me and tell me, call me nigger.

558
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,328
You know what this means?

559
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,908
Of course I shouldn't call them nigger.

560
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,185
It's an empty offer.

561
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,270
But what they want to signal me in this way,

562
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,808
it's not I'm a masochist, I want to be humiliated,

563
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,268
But simply, we have a real contact.

564
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:04,198
I doubt if you can have a real contact with a real

565
00:28:04,222 --> 00:28:07,789
person without, at least, it doesn't work always,

566
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,666
but as a rule, a small exchange of

567
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,465
obscenities or something like that.

568
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,389
But sorry, what I want to say, back to my basic point,

569
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,668
is that all these problems that we have,

570
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,800
even with political correctness, how language functions,

571
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:25,166
are we free or not? With digitalization, with brain science,

572
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,868
These are basically philosophical problems

573
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:32,009
and ordinary people will have to deal with them.

574
00:28:32,271 --> 00:28:34,448
Abortion is maybe the first case of this.

575
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,769
Are we aware that to answer the question,

576
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,670
I'm sorry, don't misunderstand,

577
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,845
but to answer the question,

578
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,145
should there be abortion or not?

579
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:45,908
You have implicitly at least to

580
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,049
answer some philosophical question,

581
00:28:48,271 --> 00:28:50,169
old values, you cannot simply say,

582
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,087
let's look at Christianity or whatever.

583
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,087
Because precisely because we are in this confused state,

584
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,622
where we cannot simply rely on old norms.

585
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,960
Like, again, something like direct link of our

586
00:29:01,984 --> 00:29:03,805
brains with a computer

587
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:05,650
changes our entire pedagogy.

588
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,487
What does it mean to learn something，

589
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,388
when you just click the button and you know that.

590
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,650
So what I'm saying is that questions usually reserved

591
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:19,328
for philosophy will become everyday questions.

592
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:21,189
And the next thing that happens.

593
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,850
But it's the other way around anyway, isn't it?

594
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,538
I mean, everyday questions actually are with a lot of problems to take

595
00:29:28,457 --> 00:29:30,269
The problem with some brain scientists and others

596
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,390
they think that philosophy is over

597
00:29:33,531 --> 00:29:35,393
Stephen Hawking put it in one of his

598
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:37,279
last books that philosophy is dead

599
00:29:39,135 --> 00:29:41,148
In some ironic sense he is not even ironic

600
00:29:41,551 --> 00:29:41,794
he is right

601
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:48,410
and now we come from actual questions to my philosophical concerns

602
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:55,464
The big tragedy for me was this me was this I call it

603
00:29:55,488 --> 00:30:00,090
transcendental linguistic term where all this let's call

604
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:05,258
them this way naive direct ontological

605
00:30:05,282 --> 00:30:07,030
questions were prohibited were

606
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:10,058
considered naive so that all you were

607
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:12,970
allowed to do is to reflect on the

608
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,117
horizon of understanding or as Michel

609
00:30:15,141 --> 00:30:17,150
Foucault would have put it on the

610
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,928
episteme, for example, if you were to ask

611
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:24,630
Michel Foucault or Foucault here, do I have

612
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,552
an immortal soul, since answer would have

613
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,870
been something like, we should analyse within

614
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,598
which discursive field we can even raise this

615
00:30:34,622 --> 00:30:38,070
question, all you can do is just to point

616
00:30:38,331 --> 00:30:41,069
out the horizon, discursive horizon within

617
00:30:41,093 --> 00:30:43,830
which it's coming, and so this big naive

618
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,418
of the logical question what's the origin of our

619
00:30:46,442 --> 00:30:49,010
universe and so on were neglected that's why i

620
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,578
think that natural science is entered and the

621
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:55,930
philosophical game and hawkin is right where he

622
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,227
said what till one 200 years ago were considered

623
00:30:59,251 --> 00:31:02,330
philosophical question does the world has a

624
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,808
beginning or not do we have free will and so on

625
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:09,170
these are today perceived as scientific questions

626
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:13,049
Here I remain a traditional European philosopher.

627
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,210
I don't think philosophy disappears.

628
00:31:16,672 --> 00:31:21,829
I don't think positive natural science can do the entire job.

629
00:31:22,472 --> 00:31:25,210
There is still work for philosophy to do it,

630
00:31:25,671 --> 00:31:28,607
but at the same time we have to break out

631
00:31:28,631 --> 00:31:32,009
of this transcendental reflexive questioning

632
00:31:32,632 --> 00:31:35,346
and that's the big problem.

633
00:31:36,471 --> 00:31:38,486
We have to, what people like Kenton, Meyasu

634
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,630
and all these new materialists are doing

635
00:31:42,132 --> 00:31:46,549
We have to return to big ontological questions

636
00:31:47,252 --> 00:31:52,869
but in a not naive realist way

637
00:31:54,174 --> 00:31:57,710
That's my problem, that's why I look into Hegel

638
00:31:58,051 --> 00:32:02,710
How to move beyond the alternative between Kantian transcendentalism

639
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,710
things in itself are out there, we don't care about them

640
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,244
all we can do is our horizon of

641
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:11,190
understanding and naive realism we humans

642
00:32:11,391 --> 00:32:14,239
are part of a universe a universe we are

643
00:32:14,263 --> 00:32:17,110
just one of the elements no I think that

644
00:32:18,273 --> 00:32:20,547
I work so hard about this specific

645
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:24,368
problems the whole first part 300 pages

646
00:32:25,171 --> 00:32:30,256
of my absolute recoil works of this again how to break out of

647
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,365
the a transcendental horizon without falling into naive realism

648
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,690
Again, I think Hegel is the

649
00:32:39,714 --> 00:32:41,405
way or even at this level

650
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,759
I see the great legacy of Christianity.

651
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:49,506
Hegel's trick is that the problem itself is its own solution.

652
00:32:49,506 --> 00:32:51,123
In what sense Christianity?

653
00:32:51,123 --> 00:32:52,900
What is the Christian solution?

654
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,264
I am an atheist incidentally.

655
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:58,369
But I see a certain legacy in

656
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,939
Christianity say you as a believer

657
00:32:59,963 --> 00:33:03,770
feel abandoned by God what's the Christian solution it's

658
00:33:03,911 --> 00:33:06,079
not oh if you work hard fast yourself

659
00:33:06,103 --> 00:33:08,270
you will rejoin God no it's a much more

660
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,674
radical one is at that point when you

661
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,110
feel abandoned you identify with Christ

662
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:16,861
that you know Eli Eli Lama father why

663
00:33:16,885 --> 00:33:19,150
have you forsaken me so you transpose

664
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:22,930
your division your separation from God into God

665
00:33:22,954 --> 00:33:26,895
himself God on the cross is separated from himself.

666
00:33:26,895 --> 00:33:30,074
It means that the very distance, the

667
00:33:30,098 --> 00:33:33,276
very gap, is part of the thing itself.

668
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:36,387
And this is the formula that Hegel repeats again and again.

669
00:33:37,471 --> 00:33:40,279
It's not to reach some unity above the

670
00:33:40,303 --> 00:33:43,110
gap, it's to see how what you experience

671
00:33:43,351 --> 00:33:45,375
as separation is a negativity

672
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:48,363
inscribed into the absolute itself.

673
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:49,405
I do very fast now.

674
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,901
But also if you can see that also again

675
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:54,659
following Hegel, clearly there are different

676
00:33:54,683 --> 00:33:57,142
philosophical questions that come to the

677
00:33:57,166 --> 00:34:00,005
fore at different times, that's very clear.

678
00:34:01,131 --> 00:34:03,210
And you've given us a good idea of what kind of...

679
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:06,356
Okay, now you are silently already sharpening your knife,

680
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,505
because you're strike, strike, bat, go to bat, directly.

681
00:34:10,573 --> 00:34:14,008
No, no, no, you've shown us what kind of approach we might take.

682
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,038
I was just wondering, you know, whether there's

683
00:34:16,062 --> 00:34:17,710
a sort of single philosophical question that

684
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,307
you think is the salient question of our time.

685
00:34:22,254 --> 00:34:25,032
Maybe, I will go into this, maybe it may sound

686
00:34:25,056 --> 00:34:28,269
strange, but I would say the status of appearance,

687
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:32,524
because you know another way to wrap it up

688
00:34:32,548 --> 00:34:36,670
in one formula, what's the greatness of Hegel

689
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:39,798
is that the usual, even for Kant, problem

690
00:34:39,822 --> 00:34:42,829
is always are we limited to our constraint,

691
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,704
to our world of appearances, can we move beyond to reach reality

692
00:34:47,728 --> 00:34:52,308
itself the way things really and Hegel, he says it somewhere

693
00:34:53,112 --> 00:34:56,949
Hegel's problem is the opposite one

694
00:34:57,392 --> 00:35:00,206
The true miracle, that is the miracle of negativity

695
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:05,170
How come that reality is not just flat reality

696
00:35:05,491 --> 00:35:08,188
How can reality appear to itself?

697
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,908
Because appearance means a terrible gap

698
00:35:11,351 --> 00:35:13,949
Things are not directly what they are

699
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:15,788
They appear to themselves

700
00:35:16,091 --> 00:35:18,529
And now, if you dare to use it

701
00:35:20,093 --> 00:35:22,498
Here I'm absolute Hegelian.

702
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:27,710
The minimum of reflectivity, appearance, is absolutely universal.

703
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,498
For me, now I'm jumping very fast.

704
00:35:30,498 --> 00:35:34,309
The lesson of quantum physics is that appearances matter.

705
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,160
How you measure it, how things appear determines

706
00:35:38,184 --> 00:35:40,710
what things are, and now you can use it or not.

707
00:35:41,294 --> 00:35:43,227
Is that a translation problem, basically?

708
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:46,908
No, although there are translations in what sense.

709
00:35:48,176 --> 00:35:50,675
One wants to be more seriously philosopher.

710
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:52,529
One has to be very precise here.

711
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:55,928
Phenomenon is not the same as Herpsheimer.

712
00:35:56,432 --> 00:35:58,650
I meant in terms of language, I meant in terms of spheres.

713
00:35:58,911 --> 00:36:03,237
When you are talking about the quantum level, there is a gap.

714
00:36:05,471 --> 00:36:08,630
I know and I am totally opposed to those simplists who claim

715
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:12,508
who want to somehow ground the possibility of human

716
00:36:12,532 --> 00:36:16,849
freedom directly into uncertainty, indeterminacy of reality

717
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:18,747
but I wasn't talking about this

718
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:21,688
all I was talking about was what really attracts me

719
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:26,500
and it's a very abstract idea philosophically in quantum physics is A

720
00:36:27,414 --> 00:36:32,809
this idea of and I vary it a lot of times in my books

721
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,708
this idea of ontological incompleteness of reality

722
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:41,010
it's not as Lenin and naive materialist thought

723
00:36:41,471 --> 00:36:44,329
reality is out there fully real we

724
00:36:44,353 --> 00:36:47,210
just cannot get to know it no what if

725
00:36:47,511 --> 00:36:51,796
reality in itself is in a way structured

726
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,650
around the gap not fully real do you

727
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,179
know the story I love it for your

728
00:36:55,203 --> 00:36:57,070
readers maybe you know it which is my

729
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:59,599
favorite story here I found it in some

730
00:36:59,623 --> 00:37:01,930
popular introduction to philosophy the

731
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:09,810
guy tries to read quantum physics based on video games you know in

732
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:12,757
In video games, when you are immersed into a

733
00:37:12,781 --> 00:37:15,708
game, reality there is not fully constituted.

734
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,427
For example, you have a forest in the background,

735
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:22,350
if it's not part of the game that you can

736
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,204
go into that forest, then all the trees are not

737
00:37:25,228 --> 00:37:26,778
programmed in detail, or

738
00:37:26,802 --> 00:37:27,961
even most of the houses.

739
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:31,023
You just see the outside of the house, if

740
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:34,030
it's not part of the game that you enter the

741
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,837
house then we very well know that these

742
00:37:35,861 --> 00:37:40,050
houses are within the computer program

743
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:44,068
without okay and the idea of this guy

744
00:37:44,092 --> 00:37:47,989
I love it is that something why did the

745
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,548
TV program sorry the game programmer not

746
00:37:50,572 --> 00:37:52,870
construct full reality because he would

747
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,498
just lose time it's meaningless why to

748
00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:58,630
to why to to program the inside of a

749
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,800
house when it's not part of the game

750
00:38:00,824 --> 00:38:03,310
that you enter it okay the idea isn't it

751
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:06,157
The most wonderfully simple one is that God

752
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:09,008
did the same when he created the universe

753
00:38:09,431 --> 00:38:11,364
He stopped at the subatomic level

754
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:16,607
because he thought we humans are too stupid to progress so far

755
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,684
or they will not be able to move beyond atoms

756
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:23,089
so why should I bother to program velocity and position

757
00:38:23,451 --> 00:38:27,966
and the idea is a very nice cynical one is that God underestimated us

758
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:31,396
we with quantum physics as it were, caught God with

759
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,486
his pants down, you know, ah, you were too late.

760
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:38,257
But now comes the true definition of materialism for me.

761
00:38:38,257 --> 00:38:42,148
We can think this incompleteness without God.

762
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,354
You don't need a creator.

763
00:38:44,354 --> 00:38:46,761
Just reality is incomplete.

764
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:50,934
That's one mega result, then there are many others.

765
00:38:50,934 --> 00:38:53,321
So you see, I'm very careful here.

766
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:55,267
I don't try to teach one to physicists.

767
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:02,536
I just try to provide materialist, even philosophical

768
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:10,129
reading and again it all focuses on the status of appearances

769
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:14,804
So again, as Hegel says, the true problem is how appearances

770
00:39:14,828 --> 00:39:19,187
emerge or as he put it, Hegel and other German idealists

771
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:23,329
The problem is not are we caught into

772
00:39:23,353 --> 00:39:26,289
our subjectivity the problem is how

773
00:39:26,313 --> 00:39:29,250
must reality be structured in itself

774
00:39:29,274 --> 00:39:32,210
so that something like subjectivity,

775
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:35,983
subjective appearance can emerge out of it.

776
00:39:35,983 --> 00:39:38,190
You know, must there be some reflexivity,

777
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:43,464
incompleteness, negativity already out there and earth?

778
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,449
Hegel explicitly raises this question,

779
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,615
that's why, that's why now comes the provocation

780
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:51,050
as they would put in the United States,

781
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:55,338
trigger warning to get it now recently a friend

782
00:39:55,362 --> 00:39:59,389
of mine showed me some uh and i really mean it

783
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:02,429
i'm not denying that when i was young i didn't

784
00:40:02,453 --> 00:40:05,050
watch hardcore pornography but a friend of mine

785
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:09,128
has shown me some typical hardcore heterosexual

786
00:40:09,152 --> 00:40:12,969
scenes and we analyzed them and came to the point

787
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:17,851
how much more complex things are let's say this is

788
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:22,276
traditional hardcore pornography addressed at a man.

789
00:40:22,276 --> 00:40:26,125
It's not true that woman is reduced to an object.

790
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:27,888
No, woman is the only subject.

791
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,175
Typical scene is this one.

792
00:40:30,175 --> 00:40:32,443
Woman is being penetrated.

793
00:40:32,443 --> 00:40:34,449
Man is reduced to pure instrument.

794
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,367
We find dozens of movies he found where you

795
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:40,027
don't even see man's face, he doesn't matter.

796
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,128
So the typical scene is this one.

797
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,318
Well, it's because you're taking the

798
00:40:43,342 --> 00:40:44,369
perspective of the man, that's why.

799
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,374
No, I don't think so.

800
00:40:45,374 --> 00:40:48,165
I will tell you which perspective you are taking.

801
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:53,065
Man is, you see in front, man's penis penetrating the

802
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:57,989
woman, legs spread wide, and then in the background

803
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,507
between her thighs, you

804
00:41:00,531 --> 00:41:02,648
always see her face staring

805
00:41:02,672 --> 00:41:05,252
into the camera, or at least showing her face.

806
00:41:05,252 --> 00:41:08,441
So I claim you don't identify with the man.

807
00:41:08,441 --> 00:41:11,028
You identify with yourself as a viewer.

808
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:14,575
What you are looking for is not your pleasure,

809
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:17,190
but the confirmation that woman enjoys.

810
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:20,141
So This is not greatest greater for women.

811
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:22,410
I claim women are in this way even more humiliated

812
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,614
I'm not a fan.

813
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,422
What I'm saying is that even here when

814
00:41:25,446 --> 00:41:27,710
you think oh my god, it's just sex

815
00:41:27,911 --> 00:41:31,530
Whatever the structure is that of minimal reflexivity

816
00:41:33,031 --> 00:41:35,966
It doesn't if you were to show just from a close-up sex

817
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:39,470
organs penetrating each other is what could mean vulgar boring

818
00:41:39,972 --> 00:41:45,710
It has to be the woman stares back and it's very humiliating for her

819
00:41:46,192 --> 00:41:49,946
She has to do, I will not go into it, all the sounds and so on.

820
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,922
But what I'm saying is that how you see how, even in the most

821
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:59,227
immediate sexual pressure, the structure is more complicated one.

822
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:04,237
And isn't the same lesson for quantum physics that measurement

823
00:42:04,261 --> 00:42:05,877
is not a measurement of some

824
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:08,602
reality which is out there.

825
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,509
Measurement in a way constitutes partially reality.

826
00:42:13,852 --> 00:42:14,587
But how?

827
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:18,251
But measurement doesn't constitute reality, measurement

828
00:42:18,275 --> 00:42:21,730
constitutes the way that we look at reality, right?

829
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,473
It's a little bit more radical.

830
00:42:23,473 --> 00:42:26,045
Here it was a conflict between your guy, I

831
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:28,641
mean ironically, Heisenberg and Bill Bohr.

832
00:42:35,413 --> 00:42:37,011
Heisenberg thought that his uncertainty

833
00:42:37,035 --> 00:42:38,549
principle is only epistemological.

834
00:42:39,654 --> 00:42:43,730
We cannot measure at the same time velocity and position of a particle.

835
00:42:44,452 --> 00:42:47,108
Bohr criticized him, Bohr claimed, no,

836
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:49,787
this uncertainty is in the thing itself.

837
00:42:51,413 --> 00:42:54,428
Particles do not have at the same time.

838
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:58,043
So the problem is that measuring the appearance,

839
00:42:58,067 --> 00:43:01,289
the effect, in a way affects reality itself.

840
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:05,710
And again, the problem is how to read this in a non-idealist way.

841
00:43:06,011 --> 00:43:07,829
You know, to avoid all the bullshit that,

842
00:43:07,853 --> 00:43:09,670
oh, there must be a mind to construct.

843
00:43:10,552 --> 00:43:13,488
Maybe it has to do with the structure of reality, but maybe also it

844
00:43:13,512 --> 00:43:16,447
has to do with the expectations we have of reality, wouldn't you say?

845
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:21,411
Okay, but again, I agree with you, but I

846
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:25,845
would nonetheless add here the Hegelian point.

847
00:43:25,845 --> 00:43:28,149
Don't put reality there and us here.

848
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:31,852
How is reality structured so that our

849
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:35,489
expectations of reality can influence it?

850
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,688
But okay, let's not loss, thank you.

851
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,409
You see which problems are bothering me here.

852
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:41,062
Absolutely.

853
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:44,406
Yeah, and that's why basically I'm an old-fashioned,

854
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,649
I'm even tempted to say old-fashioned philosopher.

855
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:51,065
I think we didn't yet really move beyond Hegel.

856
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:55,871
What happened after Hegel was different variations

857
00:43:55,895 --> 00:44:00,028
of transcendentalism, even the most creative Marxism.

858
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:03,668
Therefore, we practiced transcendentalism.

859
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:06,349
Human collective praxis is the ultimate

860
00:44:06,373 --> 00:44:08,990
transcendental horizon of how we perceive.

861
00:44:09,331 --> 00:44:11,068
Either they are transcendentalists or

862
00:44:11,092 --> 00:44:12,829
they are vulgar, naive materialists.

863
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:14,314
OK, thank you very much.

864
00:44:14,314 --> 00:44:16,372
I would like to just move on so we can talk

865
00:44:16,396 --> 00:44:18,849
just very briefly at least about your new books.

866
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,557
I've got a new book out again.

867
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:22,185
I have no idea how you do this, but...

868
00:44:23,251 --> 00:44:23,773
I cheat.

869
00:44:23,773 --> 00:44:24,196
I cheat.

870
00:44:24,196 --> 00:44:25,763
I copy myself all the time.

871
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,030
Many of the political books...

872
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:27,895
No, no, no.

873
00:44:27,895 --> 00:44:29,929
It's not like people think, do you write 20 pages per day?

874
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:31,194
No, no, no.

875
00:44:31,194 --> 00:44:35,010
My output is quite human, or to put it in ironic terms, somebody like

876
00:44:35,171 --> 00:44:38,623
Sloterdijk, writes three, four times more than me.

877
00:44:38,623 --> 00:44:40,229
Don't worry here.

878
00:44:40,972 --> 00:44:43,909
So, now, your new book is called, and I haven't read it yet

879
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:46,870
because I haven't been able to see a copy, but it's on time.

880
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:50,850
If you want to today, I can send both of you the final proof.

881
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:51,584
You're so, so kind.

882
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,879
No, no, no, and I promise you something.

883
00:44:54,879 --> 00:44:58,270
You will see that I have met, and I promise you if we ever meet again,

884
00:44:58,674 --> 00:45:02,290
I will never ask you Did you already have the time to read it?

885
00:45:02,714 --> 00:45:04,149
I hate authors who do this

886
00:45:04,694 --> 00:45:07,147
Here you have my book but then you get them

887
00:45:07,391 --> 00:45:09,250
Oh, did you already have a chance to read it?

888
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:09,882
Sorry, go on

889
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:10,963
We'll read it as well

890
00:45:11,372 --> 00:45:12,948
So the book is called Incontinence of the

891
00:45:12,972 --> 00:45:15,270
Void Economical Philosophical Spandrels

892
00:45:15,514 --> 00:45:16,270
Now, okay

893
00:45:16,752 --> 00:45:19,647
So I just had this short summary that I looked at

894
00:45:20,652 --> 00:45:23,627
and that said that you explore the empty spaces between

895
00:45:23,651 --> 00:45:27,290
philosophy, psychoanalysis and the critique of political economy

896
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,907
Now, to talk about spandrels...

897
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:33,290
It's a term from Steven K. Gould and so on, you know it

898
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:36,230
I'm familiar with the term, so it comes from architecture

899
00:45:36,612 --> 00:45:39,270
but then finds use in evolutionary biology

900
00:45:40,035 --> 00:45:42,250
But yes, so to talk about spandrels really means that

901
00:45:42,632 --> 00:45:46,189
of course you have to assume the integrity of those disciplines

902
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,301
So if you try to find the spaces...

903
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:50,059
Here I would doubt it, why?

904
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:51,533
If you try to find the spaces then you

905
00:45:51,557 --> 00:45:53,209
have to assume the arches, don't you?

906
00:45:53,995 --> 00:45:56,089
I would have claimed in a Hegelian way

907
00:45:56,573 --> 00:45:57,603
Sorry, can I be of any help?

908
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:00,700
You see, things always make me nervous.

909
00:46:04,293 --> 00:46:10,869
My solution would have been that what if everything in order to exist

910
00:46:11,431 --> 00:46:13,329
needs a spandrel, needs an empty

911
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,250
place which can be transformed.

912
00:46:15,631 --> 00:46:18,439
In the thesis of Gould, for example, that

913
00:46:18,463 --> 00:46:21,270
you don't have fully constituted organisms

914
00:46:21,572 --> 00:46:24,109
and then by chance spandrels and so on.

915
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:28,670
The whole evolution, according to Gould, is based on spandrels.

916
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:31,117
You have anti-spaces, you have organs

917
00:46:31,141 --> 00:46:33,548
of no use, with just like appendings.

918
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,368
Yes, but they are a by-product of

919
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:37,546
things that have been driven towards...

920
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:42,349
Yeah, but his idea, and he is really radical here,

921
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:46,118
is that this imbalance, in the sense that a

922
00:46:46,142 --> 00:46:49,769
product never, never fully fits its function.

923
00:46:50,471 --> 00:46:52,218
There is an element by-product, he goes

924
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:53,989
to the end, and the beauty of Gould,

925
00:46:54,331 --> 00:46:58,090
is that he interprets accounts for human language in this way.

926
00:46:58,432 --> 00:47:01,009
It's a by-product, it wasn't meant to be.

927
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:05,648
But a by-product of things that are actually driven by adaptive values,

928
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:08,904
so there are other things that have adaptive values,

929
00:47:10,231 --> 00:47:14,090
so you have to assume the existence of those in order to have spandrels.

930
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:16,009
Yeah, but for him adaptation works through spandrels.

931
00:47:16,393 --> 00:47:17,343
That would be my view.

932
00:47:18,612 --> 00:47:21,825
Yeah, but the paradox is that the thing itself

933
00:47:23,411 --> 00:47:26,618
cannot ever not even conceptually fully

934
00:47:26,642 --> 00:47:28,690
function you need byproducts you need

935
00:47:28,871 --> 00:47:31,229
all the time byproducts our entire human

936
00:47:31,253 --> 00:47:33,490
progress but even in animal kingdom

937
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:37,178
greatness of Darwin for good is is based

938
00:47:37,202 --> 00:47:40,770
in byproducts so going back to my book

939
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:45,429
what I would have said is that is that

940
00:47:45,453 --> 00:47:49,590
in the same way I think that from the

941
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:59,289
very beginning that, ok, I'll put it like this, something

942
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:01,908
happens with modern philosophy, by modern

943
00:48:01,932 --> 00:48:04,249
philosophy I'm old fashioned here, I mean

944
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:08,378
post-Kantian Kant and post-Kantian thoughts,

945
00:48:08,402 --> 00:48:12,249
which has a privileged link with other fields,

946
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,858
with for example psychoanalysis.

947
00:48:15,858 --> 00:48:21,412
I claimed that Freud was not simply a positive scientist and so on.

948
00:48:21,412 --> 00:48:26,122
This may be the fundamental thesis of my work.

949
00:48:26,122 --> 00:48:29,609
The philosophy or the philosophical stance

950
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:33,453
implied by Freud, it's not some simple naturalism

951
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:36,730
in the sense of sexuality is important and so

952
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:44,669
It's a vision of man which fits Kantian philosophy or German idealism.

953
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:46,444
So for me, my ultimate task

954
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:50,268
would be to read again German

955
00:48:50,292 --> 00:48:56,607
idealism against the background of what psychoanalysis brought us.

956
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:01,809
Because psychoanalysis is a much more delicate thing.

957
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,117
It's not this substantialism of the unconscious,

958
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:05,888
you know, all these stupid metaphors.

959
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:11,186
conscious ego is just like the tip of the iceberg, all the dead there.

960
00:49:11,186 --> 00:49:15,398
No, unconscious is purely phenomenal for Freud.

961
00:49:15,398 --> 00:49:18,889
Jung has a substantial notion of the unconscious.

962
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:18,989
So

963
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:24,458
again, in one line, my program is that only by

964
00:49:24,482 --> 00:49:29,489
reading psychoanalysis through German idealism

965
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:33,127
can we arrive at what psychoanalytic

966
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:37,610
revolution really amounts to, and vice versa.

967
00:49:39,294 --> 00:49:42,000
Only re-read through Freud can we keep

968
00:49:42,024 --> 00:49:44,730
alive the tradition of German idealism.

969
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:49,479
And I think here it's a line, I'm saying this still as a

970
00:49:49,503 --> 00:49:53,790
kind of leftist Marxist, more important than Marx himself.

971
00:49:54,171 --> 00:49:56,974
I think philosophically Marx following Feuerbach

972
00:49:56,998 --> 00:50:00,160
and all those is a regression with regard to Hegel.

973
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:04,155
But when you ask me that, my point is this one,

974
00:50:04,179 --> 00:50:07,623
now I can give you only a very condensed version.

975
00:50:08,351 --> 00:50:11,519
The idea came to me and to my good friend

976
00:50:11,543 --> 00:50:15,189
Jobkopjek that the structure, you know Lacan

977
00:50:15,931 --> 00:50:20,608
in his Seminar 20 Encore on

978
00:50:20,632 --> 00:50:22,183
feminine jouisons and some

979
00:50:22,207 --> 00:50:25,596
others develops his famous or infamous formulas of situation.

980
00:50:25,596 --> 00:50:30,249
He wants to account for the masculine versus feminine sexuality

981
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:35,685
through some logical paradoxes, universality with exception and so on.

982
00:50:35,685 --> 00:50:40,106
And John Kovac originally came to this idea that what Lacan

983
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:44,550
is describing there, and he wasn't aware of it, I checked

984
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:48,258
with his people who knew Lacan, are the

985
00:50:48,282 --> 00:50:51,869
very structures of Kantian antinomies.

986
00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:57,796
Dynamic antinomies are what Lacan calls masculine,

987
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:04,596
mathematical antinomies are what Lacan calls feminine.

988
00:51:04,596 --> 00:51:07,298
So of course I'm not talking about

989
00:51:07,322 --> 00:51:11,010
biological sexuality, I'm talking about why

990
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:15,919
our universe, even the most abstract conceptual universe is

991
00:51:15,943 --> 00:51:21,155
sexed, because of certain paradoxes of symbolisation and so on.

992
00:51:21,155 --> 00:51:26,546
My second point is that this Kantian structure of antinomies

993
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:31,503
as the ultimate horizon, we cannot move beyond them.

994
00:51:31,503 --> 00:51:33,730
Kant's mistake was that, as Hegel put

995
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:36,467
it in his well-known critique of Kant,

996
00:51:36,491 --> 00:51:39,087
that Kant was too tender towards things.

997
00:51:39,087 --> 00:51:42,460
For him, antinomies were limited to our knowledge.

998
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:46,053
Antinomies were things themselves cannot be antinomic.

999
00:51:46,053 --> 00:51:49,303
Hegel's point is yes, they can.

1000
00:51:49,303 --> 00:51:53,995
So what I'll try to do is, through this approach, by taking

1001
00:51:54,019 --> 00:51:58,710
Kantian antinomies seriously in the sense of they concern

1002
00:51:59,312 --> 00:52:02,198
the thing itself, to read the implicit

1003
00:52:02,222 --> 00:52:05,029
Kantian and Hegelian than ontology

1004
00:52:05,053 --> 00:52:07,899
in accordance to what I improvised

1005
00:52:07,923 --> 00:52:10,769
that unfinished universe and so on.

1006
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:14,448
It means that the world in itself is

1007
00:52:14,472 --> 00:52:19,206
antinomic, not fully constituted and so on.

1008
00:52:19,206 --> 00:52:22,794
There we have the connection with Freud,

1009
00:52:22,818 --> 00:52:26,405
sexuality, sexual difference and ontology.

1010
00:52:26,405 --> 00:52:28,368
I'm moving very fast, you may not be

1011
00:52:28,392 --> 00:52:30,919
convinced. I'm just giving you the outline.

1012
00:52:30,919 --> 00:52:34,641
My next step is an old-fashioned Marxist but it's said in Hegel's

1013
00:52:34,665 --> 00:52:36,889
belief that, nonetheless,

1014
00:52:36,913 --> 00:52:40,068
capitalism is something exceptional.

1015
00:52:40,068 --> 00:52:42,869
The logic of, and here we come back to your

1016
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:46,430
spatulas and so on, the logic of surplus value that

1017
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:52,788
we find in capitalism, where the thing cannot exist without its surplus.

1018
00:52:52,788 --> 00:52:56,136
What appears as a secondary surplus is the

1019
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,508
very motive, what triggers it, and so on.

1020
00:52:59,508 --> 00:53:03,312
In the second part of the book, I go into detail in

1021
00:53:03,336 --> 00:53:06,635
detail of this parallel between

1022
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:07,750
what Lacan calls surplus

1023
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:13,524
enjoyment, the additional twist in enjoyment which changes simple

1024
00:53:13,548 --> 00:53:18,940
pleasure in what we usually call in more emphatic terms enjoyment.

1025
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:23,053
And I hope some of them will be amusing numerous examples.

1026
00:53:23,053 --> 00:53:27,644
For example, for me, what fascinates me is, I give

1027
00:53:27,668 --> 00:53:32,916
you a horrible political example of enjoyment in pain.

1028
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:36,646
You know, my God, you must know it, Goebbels' Totaller Creek speech.

1029
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:40,495
He does something genius in a terrifying

1030
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:42,904
way, Goebbels there in Palas in early 43.

1031
00:53:42,904 --> 00:53:48,462
All he promises to German people is more suffering.

1032
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:51,677
He says, do you want a creek, a war which will be so total that

1033
00:53:51,701 --> 00:53:54,335
you cannot even imagine how much you will suffer

1034
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:55,229
and people can...

1035
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:58,828
So these paradoxes of pleasure in pain, or

1036
00:53:58,852 --> 00:54:02,050
what I claim is that for a certain type, I'm

1037
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,638
now jumping just to give an idea of examples,

1038
00:54:04,662 --> 00:54:07,150
for a certain type of sexuality, maybe it's

1039
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:09,975
Protestant sexuality, if you don't

1040
00:54:09,999 --> 00:54:13,387
feel guilty, you don't really enjoy it.

1041
00:54:13,387 --> 00:54:18,128
You have to add guilt to pleasure, to really enjoy it.

1042
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:24,644
And I think all these twists of how an obstacle far from

1043
00:54:24,668 --> 00:54:30,710
blocking the thing, conditions it, keeps you moving.

1044
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:32,995
For example, I'm sorry, this will

1045
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:36,162
appear sexist, but I love the example.

1046
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:38,205
A friend of mine told me this

1047
00:54:38,229 --> 00:54:39,504
story, maybe you even know it, how?

1048
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:42,887
He told me that he had an affair with an elder lady

1049
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:46,886
had a beautiful body but she the lady

1050
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:50,850
told him that her last lover who saw her

1051
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:53,408
naked told her that except for one or

1052
00:54:53,432 --> 00:54:55,910
two kilos too much she has a perfect

1053
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:58,093
body and my friend made the right

1054
00:54:58,117 --> 00:55:00,570
reaction he told her just don't lose

1055
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:02,541
that one or two kilos because the

1056
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:04,810
paradox is that you have to have one or

1057
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:10,406
two kilos too much in this way you create the illusion that

1058
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:12,821
without those two kilos too much, your body is perfect.

1059
00:55:12,821 --> 00:55:15,516
But if you effectively take away one or two

1060
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:18,622
kilos, you lose also the perfection, you know.

1061
00:55:18,622 --> 00:55:20,670
And this fundamental imbalance,

1062
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:25,637
the surplus which bothers, which bothers harmony,

1063
00:55:25,661 --> 00:55:29,856
is the very retroactive condition of harmony.

1064
00:55:29,856 --> 00:55:33,807
Marx traced it, but he wasn't radical enough.

1065
00:55:33,807 --> 00:55:36,496
Marx's dream of of communism was

1066
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,209
that we can get capitalist dynamics,

1067
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:43,905
always more expansion, without the obstacle, without this paradox.

1068
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:45,140
Okay, it's more complex.

1069
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,684
But what I want to say is that for me,

1070
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:52,468
capitalism is in this sense an ontological phenomenon.

1071
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:57,227
It's the first social order, and the only in the history of humanity,

1072
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:00,947
where imbalance, it's not a problem, it's a solution.

1073
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:04,310
This is why always Marxists had a problem

1074
00:56:04,334 --> 00:56:07,532
with capitalism, they always count on crisis

1075
00:56:07,556 --> 00:56:09,811
but then the more capitalism is in crisis

1076
00:56:09,835 --> 00:56:12,430
the stronger it emerges out of it, you know.

1077
00:56:12,891 --> 00:56:17,670
So I deal with these ontological consequences of capitalism

1078
00:56:17,694 --> 00:56:22,472
and then I do something very pessimist at the end. the end.

1079
00:56:22,472 --> 00:56:25,333
I claim that in the classical Marxist view,

1080
00:56:25,357 --> 00:56:29,908
when you gather that proletarian revolutions

1081
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:34,922
will not be contained in this bourgeois deadlock, you want

1082
00:56:34,946 --> 00:56:39,557
something, freedom, the result is catastrophic and so on, know that.

1083
00:56:39,557 --> 00:56:44,250
We have to accept that all revolutions, even proletarian

1084
00:56:44,274 --> 00:56:48,966
ones, are caught in a process that they don't dominate.

1085
00:56:48,966 --> 00:56:52,236
Like, you want some like October Revolution, okay we

1086
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:55,530
can play this game that it was meant in a great way

1087
00:56:55,691 --> 00:56:58,463
but nonetheless it was a big attempt at liberation.

1088
00:56:58,463 --> 00:57:00,089
There are no controlled revolutions.

1089
00:57:00,311 --> 00:57:00,472
Sorry?

1090
00:57:00,472 --> 00:57:01,763
There are no controlled revolutions.

1091
00:57:01,763 --> 00:57:03,614
Yeah, there are no controlled revolutions.

1092
00:57:03,614 --> 00:57:07,207
We have to, we have to accept, it's a very Hegelian view

1093
00:57:07,231 --> 00:57:10,824
because you know Marx is here literally more idealist.

1094
00:57:10,824 --> 00:57:14,185
Marx thought, and you have this nicely done in early look-ups,

1095
00:57:14,209 --> 00:57:17,570
still one of the greatest books of 30th century, Geschichte

1096
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:20,553
und Klassenbeburszein, Marx thought that proletarian

1097
00:57:20,577 --> 00:57:23,149
revolution will be a self-transparent act.

1098
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:26,229
At that point of history, working class, the

1099
00:57:26,253 --> 00:57:29,051
subject, will know what it is doing and do it.

1100
00:57:29,051 --> 00:57:31,053
No, as you put it nicely, it's not

1101
00:57:31,077 --> 00:57:33,507
controlled, it's not self-transparent.

1102
00:57:33,507 --> 00:57:36,819
You have the same historical dialectic and so on.

1103
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:40,190
And then I approach at the end of the book these questions

1104
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:43,498
that i really like wonderful questions of

1105
00:57:43,522 --> 00:57:47,509
mortality in communism and although i don't like

1106
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:50,968
like i fight not only against transparency

1107
00:57:50,992 --> 00:57:54,430
of revolutions but against these visions that

1108
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:57,548
somehow in communism private life will be better

1109
00:57:57,572 --> 00:58:00,590
if there will be communism i claim no who knows

1110
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,938
maybe it will be worse and so on and you know

1111
00:58:02,962 --> 00:58:05,210
who may take as an example i like to jump from

1112
00:58:07,334 --> 00:58:11,430
Sostakovich the the 14th symphony it's really

1113
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:15,550
a symphony about death dying and it's so openly

1114
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:18,988
brazenly pessimist etc no wonder he wasn't able

1115
00:58:19,012 --> 00:58:22,349
to perform it while he was still alive and so on

1116
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:27,256
so again without betraying marxism i think we should

1117
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,981
introduce this let's call

1118
00:58:30,005 --> 00:58:31,756
it historical density.

1119
00:58:31,756 --> 00:58:33,836
In all social processes, also the

1120
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,789
progressive ones, they are non-transparent,

1121
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:40,917
the result is another one and so on, which means

1122
00:58:40,941 --> 00:58:45,213
that fundamentally we never know what we are doing.

1123
00:58:45,213 --> 00:58:47,450
The act is by definition displaced, you

1124
00:58:47,474 --> 00:58:49,710
get something else and so on and so on.

1125
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:54,207
That's actually a nice note on which to end this particular segment.

1126
00:58:54,207 --> 00:58:57,467
I was just going to ask you one last question so there may well

1127
00:58:57,491 --> 00:59:00,750
be a lot of readers or people actually see this video so they

1128
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:02,928
say oh should I get turns out he's a really

1129
00:59:02,952 --> 00:59:05,050
interesting guy so what what should they read

1130
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:07,749
you know what to recommend one of your many books

1131
00:59:07,773 --> 00:59:10,270
or or maybe even a book about if they have the

1132
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:14,428
time the will please read philosophical stuff for

1133
00:59:14,452 --> 00:59:18,489
example I think I wrote a short philosophical book

1134
00:59:19,111 --> 00:59:21,987
on Erignis event it was translated also in german

1135
00:59:22,011 --> 00:59:25,390
which precisely tries to go through all the

1136
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:29,038
dimensions the heideggerian event Erignis the

1137
00:59:29,062 --> 00:59:32,589
ultimate catastrophe Erignis end of the world

1138
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,766
the Erignis of the fall then all the three

1139
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:38,430
greatest philosophers they are for me

1140
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,456
Plato, Descartes, Hegel why because each of them

1141
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,703
define the whole posterity

1142
00:59:44,727 --> 00:59:46,950
as Michel Foucault put

1143
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:50,638
it somewhere isn't the whole history of philosophy

1144
00:59:50,662 --> 00:59:54,190
a history of criticism of Plato and after the card

1145
00:59:54,351 --> 00:59:56,979
they all want to get rid of the card 19th century

1146
00:59:57,003 --> 00:59:59,630
they all want to get rid of Hegel how to and I

1147
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:02,649
think they are all philosophers of an event

1148
01:00:02,673 --> 01:00:05,530
Cartesian cogito is not as he thought wrongly

1149
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:09,918
thinking substance it's a pure self-relating

1150
01:00:09,942 --> 01:00:12,850
event of Greek the same of here so I would say

1151
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:15,909
read a Reignis event if you have more energy

1152
01:00:15,933 --> 01:00:19,550
a little bit more read Absoluter Gegenstos the

1153
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:22,771
absolute recoil please go also to these

1154
01:00:22,795 --> 01:00:26,590
philosophical books this is where my real work

1155
01:00:26,771 --> 01:00:29,358
is all the philosophical stuff like the one i just

1156
01:00:29,382 --> 01:00:31,969
published the courage of hopelessness and so on

1157
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:35,768
listen i'm doing them with some kind of what

1158
01:00:35,792 --> 01:00:39,329
Sartre called movesois bad conscience you know

1159
01:00:39,851 --> 01:00:42,798
it's as if somebody else should be, what do I know

1160
01:00:42,822 --> 01:00:45,709
about society, about politics, I'm an amateur,

1161
01:00:46,071 --> 01:00:49,950
I always have this feeling that somebody else should have been

1162
01:00:49,974 --> 01:00:54,236
doing it, not me, and that I'm just feeling it for somebody else.

1163
01:00:54,236 --> 01:00:57,524
I feel bad with my political books.

1164
01:00:57,524 --> 01:01:02,080
My heart really is only in this more purely philosophical books.

1165
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,889
Thank you very much, that's fantastic.

1166
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:06,368
But now you should be a good journalist and I

1167
01:01:06,392 --> 01:01:08,590
will, okay, interviewer, know how I define it.

1168
01:01:09,513 --> 01:01:12,329
Every idiot, and I hope the two of you

1169
01:01:12,353 --> 01:01:15,169
are not one, can reproduce what I said.

1170
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:18,118
A true journalist can do this.

1171
01:01:18,118 --> 01:01:19,664
You don't cheat.

1172
01:01:19,664 --> 01:01:21,149
You use only what I said.

1173
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:24,588
But you combine it with other questions and montage

1174
01:01:24,612 --> 01:01:27,590
it so that you make me say a totally different thing,

1175
01:01:28,515 --> 01:01:29,560
but I cannot complain.

1176
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,418
You say, fuck off, sorry

1177
01:01:30,442 --> 01:01:31,590
you said this and so on.

1178
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:32,600
That's the challenge.

1179
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,489
Thank you very much.

1180
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:34,641
This is the challenge.

1
00:00:10,421 --> 00:00:10,809
不，我们没有。

2
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:11,770
哦，是的

3
00:00:11,831 --> 00:00:12,239
没有

4
00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:12,760
不，不，不

5
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:13,770
我不担心

6
00:00:13,811 --> 00:00:14,270
不是那样的

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,700
但我是个强迫症患者.

8
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,588
不，不. 我的意思是，

9
00:00:17,612 --> 00:00:19,500
我是一个痴迷的神经质。

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:21,827
所以我担心别人.

11
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,016
你有闹钟吗？你看，

12
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,186
这就是典型的我。

13
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:28,370
我担心其他人

14
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,711
我总是觉得我说得太长了

15
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:32,616
所以我会耽误别人

16
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,006
你的孩子将独自在那里

17
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,522
你不会去接他 .

18
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:37,158
没事的

19
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:40,107
抱歉我的表达方式

20
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,501
这是必须的

21
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,128
你只需拿一些像这样“有礼貌”的东西.......

22
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,330
如果你不想让我杀了你，就不要叫我教授.

23
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:56,420
当有人叫我教授时，我感到很不安.

24
00:00:58,513 --> 00:00:59,370
你就是教授。

25
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,064
这是我的问题

26
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:03,559
（在这方面）我问题严重，

27
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:06,370
不信任任何官方头衔。

28
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:08,107
但我并不以此为荣。

29
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:10,229
它让生活变得困难。

30
00:01:10,893 --> 00:01:11,951
我会自动地...

31
00:01:11,975 --> 00:01:14,370
当有人称我为教授或其他什么的时候，

32
00:01:15,455 --> 00:01:18,189
我就会自动把它当成一种讽刺。

33
00:01:18,814 --> 00:01:20,249
哦，不，不是这样的， 但这是你应得的。

34
00:01:20,532 --> 00:01:21,097
正是如此。

35
00:01:21,097 --> 00:01:22,330
它不像继承的头衔。

36
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:23,885
你又不是贵族什么的

37
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,606
看看乔姆斯基是怎么评价我的吧

38
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,724
我有点受伤了

39
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:31,885
好吧，对不起， 我说得太多了

40
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:33,602
不 不 你做得很好

41
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:37,979
但最明显的事实是，

42
00:01:38,003 --> 00:01:41,370
你不仅是个哲学家

43
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:42,804
你还是个著名的哲学家

44
00:01:43,511 --> 00:01:44,057
这很酷

45
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:45,107
这很难得， 对吧？

46
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:47,370
所以，我一会儿要问你 关于哲学家的事情。

47
00:01:47,952 --> 00:01:50,534
但我想知道，

48
00:01:50,558 --> 00:01:53,069
你的成名对你来说意味着什么？

49
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:55,350
名声在某种程度上很重要吗？

50
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,956
首先，名声是相对的。

51
00:01:56,956 --> 00:02:00,290
我有很多敌人，你们都知道，也许比我更清楚。

52
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:04,045
有些人，认为我只是个小丑，

53
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:07,330
有些人，认为在我的逗趣天性之下

54
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:09,819
隐藏着什么邪恶的原法西斯主义

55
00:02:09,843 --> 00:02:12,290
或斯大林主义等等

56
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:15,904
所以我认为，我的那些所谓的名声，

57
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,861
基本上只是让他人与我保持距离，

58
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:22,109
而不去真正认真对待我正在做的事情。

59
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:25,748
我确实这么认为，这种在谈话中的名声，

60
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:28,350
据我所猜测，其作用就是这样的。

61
00:02:29,112 --> 00:02:32,029
哦，他是个有趣的人，别把他太当回事，

62
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:34,969
但去听他的演讲，你会被逗乐的，诸如此类。

63
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,935
所以我很自豪。

64
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:41,049
我真正引以为豪的是， 它不仅限于此。

65
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:44,577
比如，

66
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:46,041
你知道我那本疯狂的书--

67
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,230
几乎和《圣经》一样长--《少于无》

68
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:52,129
你知道这本书卖得很好，英文版销量超过

69
00:02:52,153 --> 00:02:55,230
1 万册，在韩国重印了三次。

70
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:55,737
为什么？

71
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,260
我不知道，但这给了我希望，

72
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:02,708
不要低估了公众。

73
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,338
出版商自己，现在也在给我施压，

74
00:03:06,362 --> 00:03:08,561
你为什么不写一本

75
00:03:08,585 --> 00:03:09,310
关于唐纳德-特朗普的畅销书呢？

76
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,955
我为什么要写？

77
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:13,183
他这个人一点都不有趣。

78
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:15,370
他是个无聊的白痴等等。

79
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,750
但你担心你的书会成为

80
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:19,370
茶几上的书吗？

81
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,370
你知道，人们买了这些书，但实际上并没有读？

82
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:26,330
哦，我同意，但有一个很大的哲学传统。

83
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,209
现在你又开启了另一个我感兴趣的话题。

84
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,370
你知道它们不是，我不会说是咖啡桌上的书、

85
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,330
但我会把它们描述为大型畅销经典。

86
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,549
人们买它，但没人去认真地阅读它。

87
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,599
我会给你一份清单。

88
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,468
约翰-罗尔斯的《正义理论》.

89
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,988
我知道纽约有人写了一本关于罗尔斯的书

90
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,087
私下里他们向我承认，他们没有读过这本书。

91
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,147
我认为他们是对的，因为不幸的是，罗尔斯、

92
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,057
他的写作...你真的可以把它浓缩成50页左右，

93
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:03,328
而且你不会失去很多。

94
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,110
哈贝马斯的《沟通行动理论》.

95
00:04:06,772 --> 00:04:07,836
这是一本巨著。

96
00:04:07,836 --> 00:04:08,879
让我们继续.

97
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,513
他是我的朋友 虽然是右翼分子

98
00:04:10,537 --> 00:04:12,170
但他很有煽动性 我喜欢他

99
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:14,720
彼得-斯洛特迪克，他的《领域》.

100
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,748
你认为人们真的会读这些书吗？

101
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:22,367
罗伯特-布兰登，《使之明确》。

102
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,685
这些都是再版不断的名著。

103
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:28,989
人们不会读它们。

104
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:32,550
我有些怀疑，

105
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:35,170
甚至黑格尔也有类似的地方。

106
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:38,609
《精神现象学》也许（被读过），

107
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:41,690
但《逻辑学》，我怀疑人们是否真的读过

108
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,055
但在某种程度上，我认为这并不重要，

109
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,589
这就是我自称为黑格尔的观点

110
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:53,010
你读过法国作家的一本好书吗？

111
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:56,744
皮埃尔-巴亚尔，

112
00:04:56,768 --> 00:04:59,970
这本书叫《不用读完一本书》

113
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,715
美妙之处在于，这不仅仅是一种讽刺，

114
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:04,588
而是一种最好的法式风格。

115
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,267
他认真对待这个问题，

116
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,417
并且通过关于乔伊斯和其他一些作家的研究，

117
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,490
精确地证明了一个观点：

118
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,243
关于某些作者的最佳书籍，

119
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:16,809
是由那些并没有完全阅读其作品的人所写的。

120
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,936
他还特地去核实了这一点，

121
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,349
我是说他去查阅了那些关于这些作家的作者们的著作。

122
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,819
他有时会与那些不进行性活动的人发生性关系。

123
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:29,410
有时，这是一种深刻的辩证的黑格尔观点。

124
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,998
天堂并不是全知全能的，

125
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:36,469
你不需要了解所有方面；辩证法的艺术在于

126
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,598
选择正确的、激烈的抽象，

127
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:43,350
你可以忽略其他，只专注于一个特征，

128
00:05:43,374 --> 00:05:47,780
然后让这个特征影响你的整个方法。

129
00:05:47,804 --> 00:05:52,129
这是创造真正新事物的唯一方式。

130
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,020
我认为这就是哲学的悖论，你不必读完所有的哲学，

131
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:59,474
如果你知道得太多，你只会感到困惑。

132
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:01,980
但是...你知道，但是，你知道，

133
00:06:02,004 --> 00:06:04,510
如果人们买了你的书，可能没有读，

134
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:07,091
你是否仍然认为这是一个好现象，

135
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:09,495
因为这表明人们对哲学有一种兴趣？

136
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:14,036
是的，因为尽管如此，我还是隐隐的认为，

137
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,600
有那么一部分人只想读到笑话。

138
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,079
所以我收到了一些邮件，虽然不算是仇恨邮件，

139
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:25,432
但在我最近出版了更具哲学性的书后，

140
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:27,410
比如《绝对反弹》——

141
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,687
如果你在枪口下问我，我不好意思这么说，

142
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:32,510
我甚至觉得这本书有点自负——

143
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,382
这是我最好的书《绝对反弹》。

144
00:06:35,406 --> 00:06:37,930
但我收到的反馈是，

145
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,348
书中的笑话不够多，等等。

146
00:06:40,372 --> 00:06:42,730
是的，但你知道秘密是什么吗？

147
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:46,805
我会告诉你，有些人指责我，

148
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:50,582
说在我粗俗笑话的外表背后，

149
00:06:50,606 --> 00:06:54,945
我其实是一个非常传统的哲学家。

150
00:06:54,945 --> 00:06:58,214
在某种意义上，他们是对的，我正在回归那种传统。

151
00:06:58,214 --> 00:07:02,599
你没看出来吗，在我所有的笑话背后，

152
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:05,973
甚至包括我使用拉康的原因，

153
00:07:05,997 --> 00:07:11,425
严格来说只是作为重新解释黑格尔的一种手段。

154
00:07:11,425 --> 00:07:13,129
在这一点上，我非常守旧。

155
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:16,427
我的朋友，我们的想法不同，罗伯特·皮平，

156
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:19,749
我们曾经交谈并得出了相同的结论。

157
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,048
但仍然，这是非常传统的观点，

158
00:07:24,072 --> 00:07:27,970
即在哲学史上重要的仍然是康德、黑格尔这些问题。

159
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:30,273
这种运动的出现是合理的吗？

160
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:32,990
黑格尔的影响何在？

161
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,831
我觉得这很有趣，

162
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,050
尤其是对于一个对哲学史也感兴趣的人来说。

163
00:07:38,712 --> 00:07:41,299
当然，你知道，在《当下的哲学》杂志上，

164
00:07:41,323 --> 00:07:43,910
我们非常关心哲学在我们这个时代能做什么。

165
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,172
那么，您认为哲学在我们这个时代能够或应该做些什么，

166
00:07:46,196 --> 00:07:48,568
黑格尔是否具有特别重要的意义？

167
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:50,534
当然可以。

168
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:53,369
我甚至为了挑衅我的马克思主义朋友们，

169
00:07:53,393 --> 00:07:56,690
你知道，

170
00:07:56,714 --> 00:07:59,507
虽然我认为自己是某种马克思主义者，

171
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:02,870
我喜欢说，对我们这个时代而言，

172
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,573
费尔巴哈的第11论点应该是

173
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:09,248
哲学家和其他人试图在20世纪改变马克思主义的东西。

174
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:12,419
20 世纪，他们曾试图这样做。

175
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,369
我的朋友阿兰-巴迪欧称之为 "真实的激情"。

176
00:08:15,691 --> 00:08:19,389
让我们真正改变事物，但结果，委婉地说，

177
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:23,667
是古拉格、大屠杀，显然不是最好的结果。

178
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:28,810
所以，也许今天我们应该做的不是试图改变，

179
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:33,329
而是退后一步，准确地解读这件事。

180
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:36,510
因为即使在这个层面上，你会同意这一点吗？

181
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,968
我认为，我们今天需要的是

182
00:08:38,992 --> 00:08:42,309
马克思回到黑格尔的唯物主义逆转。

183
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:45,929
黑格尔以一种微妙的方式，更加唯物主义。

184
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,284
你知道我喜欢哪个黑格尔吗？

185
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,224
当他说，你知道，

186
00:08:50,248 --> 00:08:53,286
在他的《法哲学原理》中最著名的一段话，

187
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,607
密涅瓦（智慧女神雅典娜）的猫头鹰是在黄昏时分展翅高飞。

188
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,343
但你知道，这句简单的话驳斥了通常的说法，

189
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:05,343
即黑格尔是一个保守主义者，

190
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,970
他在其《法哲学原理》中描绘了一种几乎是原始法西斯主义的，

191
00:09:09,994 --> 00:09:12,569
你怎么说的，国家，一种社会形态的画面。

192
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:13,650
你认为这意味着什么？

193
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:15,610
我认为它的含义有所不同。

194
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:20,309
当黑格尔说，一个特定的社会秩序、历史秩序，

195
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,368
只有在它的时代结束时才能被真正理解。

196
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:24,507
这才是他的观点，不是吗？

197
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,476
但是你真的认为黑格尔是那么愚蠢吗，

198
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,004
以至于他不知道同样的命运也适用于他的《法哲学原理》吗？

199
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,487
在他的《法哲学原理》中

200
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:35,414
黑格尔并没有提出一个

201
00:09:35,438 --> 00:09:37,348
关于我们的社会应该如何构建的系统性理论。

202
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:40,798
他描绘了一个特定的时代，一个已经过去的社会形态，

203
00:09:40,822 --> 00:09:42,369
而他自己也意识到了这一点。

204
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:46,415
但我认为黑格尔在这里才是真正的黑格尔，

205
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:47,988
这样我才不会跑题。

206
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,066
我们的情况更接近黑格尔而非马克思。

207
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:56,208
马克思仍然相信某种最低限度的目的论。

208
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,529
你知道，我们正处于关键时刻。

209
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,912
无产阶级革命、

210
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,489
普遍救赎即使不是必然，也是有机会的。

211
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:08,616
当黑格尔将自己的处境视为后革命时代时，

212
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,028
一场大事件已经发生——

213
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,478
法国大革命。在某种意义上，这场革命出了问题，

214
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:18,329
但在这里黑格尔确实是进步的。

215
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,647
黑格尔思想的整个问题，

216
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:24,469
并不是说法国大革命是一场废话，让我们回归传统，

217
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:28,048
而是如何重复它，如何保持它的遗产活跃，

218
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:31,409
尽管有些灾难性的后果。

219
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:33,997
我想我们的情况也是一样。

220
00:10:33,997 --> 00:10:37,207
20世纪对于彻底解放的尝试，

221
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,459
我们所经历的共产主义，它们失败了。

222
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:45,069
问题是如何让这一遗产继续传承下去。

223
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,458
我们必须放弃所有那些简单的马克思主义隐喻，

224
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,829
比如我们正在乘坐历史的列车之类的，

225
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,286
你知道，我总是讽刺地使用这些隐喻。

226
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:58,664
马克思主义者喜欢说，即使时代黑暗，

227
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,629
我们也能在隧道的尽头看到光明。

228
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,448
你知道我常说的比喻是什么吗？

229
00:11:03,851 --> 00:11:08,128
是的，那是另一列火车迎面驶来的灯光

230
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,547
你知道，这就是我们的情况。

231
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,049
正如黑格尔所知，它是开放的。

232
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,623
我们无法制定任何计划。

233
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,206
黑格尔，这是非常黑格尔式的。

234
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,607
但光可能是任何东西。

235
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,069
我的意思是，不一定非得是另一列火车。

236
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,810
这真的可能是隧道尽头的曙光，不是吗？

237
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:27,628
是的，但这就是为什么一开始要摆脱虚假希望的原因。

238
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,189
即使是今天的左派也大多如此、

239
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,248
我们有大多数人，我讽刺地称他们为 "大多数人"、

240
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,610
在福山之后，仍以福山派居多。

241
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,368
他们基本上接受自由民主和

242
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:46,609
某种类型的资本主义是唯一的选择，

243
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:47,826
所以，让我们接受它吧。

244
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,453
更好的社会，更多的团结，医疗保健，

245
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,265
同性婚姻，无论你想要什么。

246
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,387
最大的问题是，我们有一些，

247
00:11:56,411 --> 00:12:00,610
其中最大的讽刺是我对福山的回答。

248
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:03,942
有一次我见到他，我告诉他这些，他笑了，

249
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:06,796
他说，好吧，就算你是对的，资本主义赢了。

250
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,130
但具有讽刺意味的是，今天，现在，

251
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:12,768
全球资本主义最有效率的管理者是

252
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:15,406
那些仍在掌权的共产党人，你知道吗？

253
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,457
因此，我认为我们最终必须接受事实

254
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:20,328
即20 世纪已经结束了。

255
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,849
所以我认为我们最终必须接受20世纪已经结束了。

256
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:26,138
无论是20世纪的社会民主福利国家、

257
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,490
强硬的真正社会主义，

258
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,787
或者更甚，我所讨厌的，

259
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:33,828
任何现在开始梦想成真的类型，

260
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,158
比如某种非代表性的直接民主，

261
00:12:37,182 --> 00:12:39,909
我对此并不信任。

262
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,647
确实，劳动问题是其中一部分。

263
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:44,702
当你说资本主义实际上是由

264
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:47,949
仍然是最佳思想家的共产主义者驱动时，

265
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,110
存在一个关于标签的问题：

266
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:52,082
我们究竟是如何准确定义资本主义的，

267
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:53,130
它有许多不同的形式。

268
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:54,827
当然，那些资本主义化的共产主义者实际上

269
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:55,856
并不是真正的共产主义者，

270
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,383
尽管他们自己可能很贫穷。

271
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:01,130
从什么意义上说，我还是一名共产党员？

272
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:02,948
只是在非常有限的意义上

273
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:06,848
首先，我们今天是否正在见证一个巨大的讽刺，

274
00:13:06,872 --> 00:13:08,009
那就是左派——

275
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:10,219
无论左派的哪个残余部分

276
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:13,485
都显然无法提供一个真正可行的全球性替代方案，

277
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:19,110
每当左翼抗议时...

278
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,909
我还记得占领华尔街的时候

279
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:24,707
我和他们一起在纽约、法兰克福

280
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,206
我坚持要问他们一个愚蠢的问题

281
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:31,221
你想要什么？

282
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,948
我告诉他们，弗洛伊德问错了问题

283
00:13:34,191 --> 00:13:34,926
本我想要什么（译注：可能是德语）

284
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:36,585
我说，你想要什么？

285
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,661
你想要什么？

286
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:40,888
没有人给我答案

287
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,350
我认为，这正是因为他们不知道自己想要什么、

288
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,257
左翼逃避道德主义、

289
00:13:47,281 --> 00:13:50,108
政治正确等等，不一而足。

290
00:13:50,191 --> 00:13:51,887
所以，我的问题就是如此。

291
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,494
一方面，我们有这么多的抗议活动，

292
00:13:54,518 --> 00:13:56,228
但却没有一个明确的概念。

293
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,248
另一方面，我们难道

294
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,830
不是在四周看到了明显的迹象，

295
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,906
表明至少我们所知道的资本主义正在走向终结吗？

296
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,243
看看我们的...

297
00:14:08,671 --> 00:14:09,600
我们只能寄希望于此。

298
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,524
看看经济，对不起，看看生态。

299
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,318
很显然，尽管资本主义可以通过

300
00:14:17,342 --> 00:14:20,528
税收和监管做些事情，但这还不够。

301
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,308
当发生大灾难时，你需要更大规模的行动。

302
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,688
看看，这里我同意福山的观点，

303
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,768
看看生物遗传学的黑暗潜力。

304
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:31,429
我们的大脑已经可以

305
00:14:31,591 --> 00:14:33,247
这甚至就是哲学问题、

306
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,709
我们的大脑已经可以被直接连接起来、

307
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,826
与个人电脑连接。

308
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:41,104
它赋予我们神奇的力量。

309
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:41,689
你真的可以做到。

310
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,868
你知道霍金不再需要他的手指了吗？

311
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,047
他想着向前，轮椅就向前移动。

312
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,587
但同时，它也会反过来，对吗？

313
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,766
我认为，例如，这就是问题所在，

314
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,388
即直接对我们的大脑进行接线的可能性，

315
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,657
这可能会改变

316
00:14:58,681 --> 00:15:01,389
对人类本质的基本定义。

317
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,468
那么，逆向劳动，甚至是人类的劳动？

318
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,787
关于劳动，你知道劳动的问题是什么吗？

319
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,369
不过，我还想问你、

320
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:08,689
你提到了政治正确、

321
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,328
我认为这是一个非常有趣的问题

322
00:15:10,753 --> 00:15:11,969
你认为...

323
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,144
不，对不起，我们先说完这点

324
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,368
我只想说

325
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:16,728
对不起，我知道我说得太多了

326
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,945
我只想说

327
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:21,549
我们面临着严重的金融资本问题，

328
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,064
所有这些虚拟资本并没有帮助，

329
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:26,417
比如如果欧洲银行

330
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:28,803
向经济中投入

331
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,188
数千亿新印制的货币，

332
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:34,829
其中大部分资金都流失在虚拟资本的投机中。

333
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:38,068
然后我们还有难民问题等等。

334
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,688
我们有所有这些问题，知识产权，

335
00:15:41,712 --> 00:15:44,910
如果你问我，资本主义正在这里分崩离析。

336
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,623
即使是像马克-扎克伯格、

337
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:49,095
埃隆-马斯克这样的人--我也鄙视他们--

338
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:50,829
甚至他们也会谈论这个话题、

339
00:15:52,053 --> 00:15:54,349
但你知道谁说了正确的悲观话，

340
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:56,669
你一定认识他，是你的同伴，

341
00:15:57,151 --> 00:15:59,389
德国社会学家、经济学家沃尔夫冈-施特里克，

342
00:15:59,413 --> 00:16:01,650
如今已成为小有名气的畅销书作家、

343
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:07,290
他说，马克思主义者完全意想不到的事情发生了。

344
00:16:08,772 --> 00:16:11,729
资本主义显然已接近其极限

345
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,989
但对于马克思主义者来说，这总是意味着

346
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:17,609
还有另一股更进步的力量在等待着接手

347
00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:20,709
今天，资本主义正在瓦解

348
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:22,808
陷入麻烦之中

349
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:26,269
我们看到，我们必须越来越多地随机应变

350
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:29,289
我们已经有了第一个非常可悲的后果

351
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:30,804
正如我经常警告的那样，

352
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:37,091
理想国家的一个新形象是

353
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:41,890
一个完全融入全球市场的国家，

354
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,026
但同时在意识形态上，

355
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:47,568
它将焦点放在自己的文化上，具有民族中心主义。

356
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:50,129
就连特朗普也在这样做

357
00:16:50,411 --> 00:16:52,549
这就是特朗普与所有独裁者相处融洽的原因

358
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,169
他与沙特阿拉伯的基本协议是

359
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,823
我们是同一个市场的一部分，

360
00:16:56,847 --> 00:16:58,645
你们买我们的军火，我们买你们的石油

361
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:03,009
你对女人做了什么并不重要，那是你们的问题

362
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,996
这种局部文化的逻辑，中国在玩这个游戏，

363
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,725
印度莫迪也在玩这个游戏、 普京在玩这个游戏

364
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:17,636
因此，我们正在接近一个新世界，在这个世界里，

365
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:24,670
全球市场将与缺乏普遍接受的解放规则并存。

366
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:29,149
这是非常可悲的，但回到你的问题，为什么是共产主义？

367
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,328
因为我认为我列举的所有问题

368
00:17:31,352 --> 00:17:33,330
都是公共问题。

369
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:35,128
对不起，能让你停一下吗？

370
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:36,228
对不起，对不起，对不起。

371
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,269
因为我觉得摄像机一直在抖。

372
00:17:38,472 --> 00:17:39,023
真对不起

373
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:39,840
对不起

374
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:41,166
现在好了。

375
00:17:41,697 --> 00:17:42,330
谢谢，对不起。

376
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:48,330
我想说的是，这些问题...这就是我美丽的梦想。

377
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:50,304
因为我说得太多了，

378
00:17:50,328 --> 00:17:53,966
他们就会（从楼上）跳下来，把我们都抓起来。

379
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,207
你也会被逮捕。

380
00:17:56,717 --> 00:17:57,228
太好了

381
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:57,881
我们继续。

382
00:17:59,052 --> 00:18:02,320
我所列举的所有问题，我断言，

383
00:18:02,344 --> 00:18:06,101
最终都是马克思所称的“共同体”问题。

384
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,977
一些共享的实质，

385
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:11,268
不应该被私有化留给市场。

386
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,032
比如生态学是我们的自然实质的问题，

387
00:18:15,056 --> 00:18:18,219
我们能够操纵到什么程度。

388
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,047
知识产权是我们的知识实质的问题。

389
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,847
生物遗传学是我们的实质问题，依此类推。

390
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,968
从这个意义上说，正如我曾经讽刺地指出的那样，

391
00:18:30,992 --> 00:18:33,808
共产主义对我来说不是一种解决方案，

392
00:18:33,832 --> 00:18:35,484
而是当今问题的名称。

393
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:41,055
我们必须在这个层面上找到解决方案，

394
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:45,744
即如何在市场关系之外处理我们的公共资源。

395
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,767
就连我那位朋友彼得·斯劳特戴克

396
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,087
他在其他方面被鄙视为近乎新法西斯主义者。

397
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,000
在他的某一章节中，我不知道，

398
00:18:54,024 --> 00:18:56,589
他写得甚至比我更快，虽然这是不可思议的，

399
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,107
我想这就是20世纪发生的事情，他的书

400
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,748
他也得出了同样的结论。

401
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,047
以 "你是否准备好为国牺牲

402
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:14,867
"为最高道德标准的民族国家时代已经结束。

403
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,011
我们需要迈出一步，例如，试想一下，

404
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:21,230
我的一位朋友让-皮埃尔-杜普伊

405
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:24,960
D-U-P-U-Y，也许你应该采访一下他，

406
00:19:24,984 --> 00:19:28,373
他是一位非常聪明的灾难理论家。

407
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:30,464
他告诉我，大海啸和辐射发生两天后，

408
00:19:30,488 --> 00:19:32,579
他就在福岛。

409
00:19:40,351 --> 00:19:42,188
他告诉我，那几个小时中

410
00:19:42,212 --> 00:19:44,049
日本政府陷入了彻底的恐慌。

411
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,958
他们认为辐射会非常强烈，

412
00:19:47,982 --> 00:19:51,469
必须疏散整个东京地区。

413
00:19:51,972 --> 00:19:52,843
这些人会去哪里？

414
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,691
这个问题要是放在过去，（解决方法）就是入侵，

415
00:19:55,715 --> 00:19:58,549
让这些人去入侵另一个国家。

416
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,644
但今天，你无法这么做。

417
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,109
我们需要更大范围的跨国合作。

418
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,369
解决经济问题的唯一办法

419
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,367
处理生物遗传学的唯一方法。

420
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,788
如果只是个别国家进行管制，

421
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,589
那中国人，他们已经疯狂地这样做了。

422
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,525
我是说，在上海郊区有20家诊所，

423
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,646
富裕的西方父母去那里，

424
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,885
再婴儿出生之前对它进行调控，欧洲的基因

425
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:30,030
我想说的是，首先作为一个忠诚的马克思主义者，

426
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,228
我绝对不是简单地反对资本主义。

427
00:20:35,771 --> 00:20:37,409
我认为资本主义，让我们面对现实吧、

428
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,488
这是人类历史上最具活力的系统。

429
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,089
它带来了令人难以置信的进步

430
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,562
这就是为什么，这意味着什么？

431
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,644
这让我很困扰。

432
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:53,328
我绝对反对这种鬼话

433
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:59,469
这种依靠本地土著传统来对抗全球资本主义的鬼话。

434
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,507
不，我们必须对抗它

435
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:03,866
以新的全球普遍愿景来对抗它。

436
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,487
资本主义，这就是我的朋友们不明白的地方。

437
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:12,327
研究英国对印度的殖民统治非常有启发性。

438
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,867
它并非是，你们都应该变得像我们一样。

439
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:17,228
它是，不，你应该保留你的文化。

440
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,048
要知道，在英国殖民者的影响下、

441
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,174
在 19 世纪，传统的种姓制度甚至得到了强化，

442
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:27,948
焕发出新的活力。

443
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:29,427
所以我认为

444
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,390
这就是为什么，又一个自相矛盾的困惑、

445
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,307
我的英雄马尔科姆-X，他看到了这一点。

446
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,307
马尔科姆-X，你知道X代表什么吗？

447
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,150
我们被连根拔起，但他清楚地看到，

448
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,843
这个X意味着

449
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:50,086
我们没有实质性的特定生活方式可以回归。

450
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,285
但他看到了一些独创性的东西。

451
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,988
他的观点是，所以我们的非裔美国人，

452
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,127
我从来不喜欢这个术语，因为它，

453
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,798
它像加勒比黑人可以说我们是什么之类的，

454
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:05,209
但好吧，归根并非返回根源。

455
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,027
那么，让我们寻找，利用这个事实，

456
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:10,687
即我们被剥夺了我们的民族实质，

457
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,038
作为一种变化，创造一种新的、

458
00:22:13,062 --> 00:22:15,009
甚至比我的更真实的普遍性。

459
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,047
所以，我还是那句话，我们必须经历资本主义。

460
00:22:20,335 --> 00:22:22,368
无法后退、逃回...

461
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,488
但同时，我们必须向前迈进，

462
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:28,049
不是因为我是乌托邦主义者，想要更多，

463
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,509
而是很明显，资本主义本身正在走向危机，

464
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,675
就其今天面临的问题而言，

465
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:38,543
从生态等方面来看，

466
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,264
在这里，我是一个悲观主义者，

467
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:47,062
因为资本主义将无法以自己的方式解决这些问题。

468
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,838
这就是为什么我们现在会出现这些悖论，

469
00:22:49,862 --> 00:22:52,081
我没有忘记，我回到你的问题，劳动。

470
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,898
听着，我觉得这是非常不理性的，即

471
00:22:55,922 --> 00:22:59,270
人们因为机器化会导致失业而感到害怕

472
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:02,648
这本应是我们听到的最好的消息。

473
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,606
（现在）没有人说，太好了，我们将不需要那么多工作了。

474
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:09,768
不，（人们都）自动的假设是一场灾难。

475
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,049
我们都曾在1970年代认为，

476
00:23:12,073 --> 00:23:13,931
在所有这些科幻故事中，

477
00:23:13,955 --> 00:23:16,300
机器最终会完成所有工作，

478
00:23:16,324 --> 00:23:18,669
而我们将有大量时间来控制和享乐。

479
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:19,611
这是可以做到的。

480
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:23,628
我们现在生活在一个非理性的社会中，人们害怕失业，

481
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,669
但那些有工作的人工作时间越来越长，强度越来越大。

482
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,106
我想回到另一个话题，

483
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,086
因为你带我们进行了一次非常有趣的探索。

484
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:36,174
所以我们从黑格尔开始，从一个高度理论的层面开始，

485
00:23:36,198 --> 00:23:39,201
他在那个意义上谈到了哲学，

486
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:47,407
而你则指向了现实生活中的问题，

487
00:23:47,431 --> 00:23:50,727
非常贴近地面的真实问题。

488
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,909
对我来说，仍然存在的问题是，

489
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,737
哲学家应该做什么？

490
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,369
你认为自己主要是一个理论家吗？

491
00:24:01,172 --> 00:24:03,420
但你也谈到了你的行动主义。

492
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,768
理论与实践之间有联系吗？

493
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:09,470
你需要理论来了解行动主义的失败之处。

494
00:24:10,093 --> 00:24:13,369
你需要理论来了解行动主义的失败之处。

495
00:24:13,992 --> 00:24:15,277
尤其是左派理论。

496
00:24:15,277 --> 00:24:18,329
左翼的整个历史，即使是在上个世纪，

497
00:24:19,054 --> 00:24:21,470
不也是一部充满灾难性失败的大历史吗？

498
00:24:21,832 --> 00:24:24,309
这就是为什么，正如我在某处讽刺地说，

499
00:24:25,211 --> 00:24:30,365
最好的马克思主义书籍通常是事后的分析，

500
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:35,370
解释为什么革命必然会失败，例如托洛茨基的分析。

501
00:24:35,631 --> 00:24:39,092
而我们得到的只是对失利原因的精彩分析，

502
00:24:39,116 --> 00:24:40,567
这难道不可悲吗？

503
00:24:42,395 --> 00:24:45,470
所以，我想说，为什么是哲学？

504
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:48,349
首先，因为我不相信实践。

505
00:24:48,732 --> 00:24:51,188
没有理论的实践是盲目的。

506
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,958
我们今天比以往任何时候都更需要理论，

507
00:24:55,982 --> 00:25:00,470
我所说的理论并不是指这种直接的行动主义理论。

508
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:02,403
我们为什么需要理论？

509
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,661
但是，理论真的能付诸实践吗？

510
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:07,008
你认为这种情况真的会发生吗？

511
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:08,777
我的意思是，作为一个理论家，

512
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:10,007
你认为这是要实现的目标吗？

513
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:14,483
在这里，我将非常谦虚。

514
00:25:14,483 --> 00:25:16,470
我们哲学家是否能提供一个新的平台或政治纲领，

515
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,958
这是值得怀疑的，我对此表示怀疑。

516
00:25:20,982 --> 00:25:25,090
但在这一点上，我跟随吉尔·德勒兹的观点，

517
00:25:25,853 --> 00:25:29,307
尽管我并非德勒兹主义者。德勒兹曾说过，

518
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:31,094
比给出正确答案更重要的是

519
00:25:31,118 --> 00:25:33,381
提出正确的问题。

520
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:36,130
在这里，哲学可以派上用场。

521
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:40,200
今天，我们面临着严重的问题。

522
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,029
但是，如果我们分析一下

523
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,673
我们提出这些问题的方式并没有解决这些问题，

524
00:25:47,697 --> 00:25:51,550
而是再现了这些问题。

525
00:25:51,871 --> 00:25:55,219
回到你的问题，这就是为什么，

526
00:25:55,243 --> 00:25:58,590
比如说，我对政治正确性表示怀疑。

527
00:25:59,272 --> 00:26:01,929
当然，我同意它的目标，

528
00:26:01,953 --> 00:26:04,610
即反对权力关系中的羞辱，

529
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,381
但你知道什么让我感到如此悲哀吗？

530
00:26:07,381 --> 00:26:09,610
至少在这里，哲学有一点介入。

531
00:26:10,733 --> 00:26:16,910
想一想政治正确所默认的人类形象，

532
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:22,570
它对骚扰和受害者状态的迷恋，

533
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:25,259
我们总是感到受到威胁。我看着你的眼睛，

534
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,810
我不想过分地凝视某位女士的眼睛超过两秒，

535
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:31,856
因为这可能被视为“视觉强奸”。

536
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,770
这种分裂是非常悲哀的，

537
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:39,134
它背后的观点是我们都是潜在的受害者，

538
00:26:39,158 --> 00:26:41,410
甚至我认为这是真的。

539
00:26:41,531 --> 00:26:43,489
我不认为这是什么大不了的事——

540
00:26:43,513 --> 00:26:45,470
哦，我的天，你应该去美国的校园看看。

541
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:51,050
你知道，我在那里曾经有过一次经历，我发表演讲时，

542
00:26:51,872 --> 00:26:56,764
一位女士站起来说：“我是混血儿，

543
00:26:56,788 --> 00:27:02,906
我是单身母亲，我有艾滋病，你说的不对。”

544
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:08,549
这太悲惨了，她甚至都不用细说。

545
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,225
不，你的逻辑是......

546
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:12,150
不，但这就是滥用，不是吗？

547
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,628
我的意思是，总的来说，

548
00:27:14,652 --> 00:27:17,109
政治正确性只是告诉我们应该调整我们的语言，

549
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:21,726
以适应世界的现实和存在的偏见。

550
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:25,269
但它的做法出了问题，

551
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:28,328
因为对我来说，

552
00:27:28,352 --> 00:27:31,249
真正超越种族主义的步骤不是改变语言。

553
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,166
我们现在需要更深入地探讨哲学，

554
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,888
但即使使用相同的语言，

555
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:40,989
也应该以一种不同的、讽刺的、非种族主义的方式使用。

556
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:45,187
比如，看看我在美国的黑人朋友、

557
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,087
他们都挑衅我，跟我说，“叫我黑鬼”。

558
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,328
你知道这意味着什么吗？

559
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,908
当然，我不应该叫他们黑鬼。

560
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,185
这是一个空洞的提议。

561
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,270
但他们想要以这种方式向我发出的信号，

562
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,808
并不是说“我是一个受虐狂，我想被羞辱”，

563
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,268
而只是表明，我们之间有了真正的接触。

564
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:04,198
我怀疑若没有至少一点点的粗话或类似的东西交流，

565
00:28:04,222 --> 00:28:07,789
你是否能与一个真实的人建立真正的联系。

566
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,666
这不总是有效，

567
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,465
但通常来说是这样的。

568
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,389
但抱歉，我想说的是，回到我的基本观点，

569
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,668
即我们面临的所有这些问题，

570
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,800
包括政治正确性、语言如何运作、

571
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:25,166
我们是否自由、数字化、脑科学...

572
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,868
这些基本上都是哲学问题

573
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:32,009
而普通人将不得不面对它们。

574
00:28:32,271 --> 00:28:34,448
堕胎也许是这方面的第一个案例。

575
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,769
我们是否意识到要回答这个问题，

576
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,670
我很抱歉，请不要误解，

577
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,845
但要回答这个问题：

578
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,145
应不应该有堕胎权？

579
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:45,908
至少在隐含地回答这个问题时，

580
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,049
你需要回答一些哲学问题，

581
00:28:48,271 --> 00:28:50,169
考虑旧的价值观，你不能简单地说，

582
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,087
让我们看看基督教或其他什么。

583
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,087
因为正是因为我们处于这种混乱的状态，

584
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,622
在这种情况下，我们不能简单地依赖旧的规范。

585
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,960
就像，再次举例，

586
00:29:01,984 --> 00:29:03,805
我们的大脑与计算机的直接连接

587
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:05,650
改变了我们整个的教育方法。

588
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,487
当你只需点击一下按钮，就知道了它的时候。

589
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,388
这时“学习”又意味着什么，

590
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,650
所以我想说的是，

591
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:19,328
通常为哲学保留的问题将变成日常问题。

592
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:21,189
接下来会发生的事情。

593
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,850
但无论如何，事情是反过来的，不是吗？

594
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,538
我的意思是，日常问题实际上充满了需要解决的问题。

595
00:29:28,457 --> 00:29:30,269
一些脑科学家和其他人认为哲学已经结束了，

596
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,390
这就是问题所在。

597
00:29:33,531 --> 00:29:35,393
斯蒂芬-霍金在其最后一本书中写道：

598
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:37,279
哲学已死

599
00:29:39,135 --> 00:29:41,148
从某种讽刺的意义上说，他甚至不是在讽刺

600
00:29:41,551 --> 00:29:41,794
他是对的

601
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:48,410
现在我们从实际问题转向我的哲学关注点。

602
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:55,464
对我来说，一个大悲剧是，

603
00:29:55,488 --> 00:30:00,090
我称之为“超验语言学转向”，在这一转向中，

604
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:05,258
所有这些我们称之为直接本体论问题的问题被禁止，

605
00:30:05,282 --> 00:30:07,030
被认为是天真的，

606
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:10,058
因此你被允许做的

607
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:12,970
只是去反思那个

608
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,117
被理解的视界

609
00:30:15,141 --> 00:30:17,150
或者正如米歇尔·福柯所说的那样，

610
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,928
在认识论领域内，例如，

611
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:24,630
如果你问米歇尔·福柯，

612
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,552
我有不朽的灵魂吗，

613
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,870
他的回答可能是，

614
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,598
我们应该分析甚至在哪个话语领域内

615
00:30:34,622 --> 00:30:38,070
我们才可以提出这个问题，

616
00:30:38,331 --> 00:30:41,069
你唯一能做的就是指出它所来自的话语视界。

617
00:30:41,093 --> 00:30:43,830
因此，这种大的天真的本体论问题，

618
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,418
比如我们的宇宙起源是什么等等，

619
00:30:46,442 --> 00:30:49,010
都被忽视了。

620
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,578
这就是为什么我认为自然科学进入了哲学游戏，

621
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:55,930
并且霍金是正确的，

622
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,227
他说200年前被认为是哲学问题的问题，

623
00:30:59,251 --> 00:31:02,330
比如世界是否有开始，

624
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,808
我们是否有自由意志等，

625
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:09,170
今天被视为科学问题。

626
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:13,049
在这里，我仍然是一位传统的欧洲哲学家。

627
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,210
我不认为哲学会消失。

628
00:31:16,672 --> 00:31:21,829
我不认为纯粹的自然科学能够完成所有的工作。

629
00:31:22,472 --> 00:31:25,210
哲学还有很多工作要做

630
00:31:25,671 --> 00:31:28,607
但与此同时，

631
00:31:28,631 --> 00:31:32,009
我们必须打破这种超验的反思性质疑

632
00:31:32,632 --> 00:31:35,346
这才是大问题。

633
00:31:36,471 --> 00:31:38,486
我们必须像肯顿、梅亚苏

634
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,630
和所有这些新唯物主义者所做的那样

635
00:31:42,132 --> 00:31:46,549
我们必须回到本体论的大问题上来

636
00:31:47,252 --> 00:31:52,869
但是是以非天真的现实主义方式

637
00:31:54,174 --> 00:31:57,710
这就是我的问题，这也是为什么我研究黑格尔，

638
00:31:58,051 --> 00:32:02,710
如何超越康德超验主义与天真现实主义之间的二元对立。

639
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,710
康德超验主义认为事物本身存在于外部，我们不关心它们，

640
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,244
我们所能做的只是我们的理解视界；

641
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:11,190
而天真现实主义则认为

642
00:32:11,391 --> 00:32:14,239
我们人类是宇宙的一部分，

643
00:32:14,263 --> 00:32:17,110
我们只是其中的一个元素。但我不这么认为。

644
00:32:18,273 --> 00:32:20,547
我在这个具体问题上努力了很多，

645
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:24,368
我的《绝对反弹》一书的前300页

646
00:32:25,171 --> 00:32:30,256
都在探讨这个问题，

647
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,365
即如何打破超验视界而不落入天真现实主义。

648
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,690
同样，我认为黑格尔的方法是一种方式，

649
00:32:39,714 --> 00:32:41,405
甚至在这个层面上

650
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,759
我看到了基督教的伟大遗产。

651
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:49,506
黑格尔的诀窍在于，问题本身就是自己的解决方案。

652
00:32:49,506 --> 00:32:51,123
在什么意义上的基督教？

653
00:32:51,123 --> 00:32:52,900
基督教的解决方案是什么？

654
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,264
顺便说一句，我是一个无神论者。

655
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:58,369
但我在基督教中看到了一种特定的遗产，

656
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,939
比如作为一个信徒，

657
00:32:59,963 --> 00:33:03,770
你感觉被上帝遗弃了，基督教的解决方案不是说，

658
00:33:03,911 --> 00:33:06,079
哦，如果你努力工作、苦行自省，

659
00:33:06,103 --> 00:33:08,270
你就能重新与上帝团聚，

660
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,674
而是一种更为激进的方式：在你感觉被遗弃的那一刻，

661
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,110
你要与基督产生认同，

662
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:16,861
就像你所知道的，“以利，以利，拉马撒巴克大尼？

663
00:33:16,885 --> 00:33:19,150
”（父啊，父啊，为什么离弃我？）。

664
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:22,930
因此你将自己与上帝的分离转化为上帝自身的分离——

665
00:33:22,954 --> 00:33:26,895
十字架上的上帝与自己分离。

666
00:33:26,895 --> 00:33:30,074
这意味着，距离、差距本身

667
00:33:30,098 --> 00:33:33,276
就是事物本身的一部分。

668
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:36,387
这就是黑格尔一再重复的公式。

669
00:33:37,471 --> 00:33:40,279
这不是为了在差距之上达到某种统一，

670
00:33:40,303 --> 00:33:43,110
而是要看到

671
00:33:43,351 --> 00:33:45,375
你所经历的分离是如何成为

672
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:48,363
绝对本身中刻入的一种否定性。

673
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:49,405
我现在讲得很快。

674
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,901
但是，如果你能看到，

675
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:54,659
再次遵循黑格尔的思路，

676
00:33:54,683 --> 00:33:57,142
很明显在不同的时期会有不同的哲学问题浮现，

677
00:33:57,166 --> 00:34:00,005
这一点非常清楚。

678
00:34:01,131 --> 00:34:03,210
你已经让我们很好地了解到，什么样的......

679
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:06,356
好了，现在你已经在默默磨刀了，

680
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,505
因为你已经开始出击、出击、击球、直接击球了。

681
00:34:10,573 --> 00:34:14,008
不不不，你已经向我们展示了我们可以采取的方法。

682
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,038
我只是在想，你知道，

683
00:34:16,062 --> 00:34:17,710
是否有一种单一的哲学问题，

684
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,307
你认为是我们这个时代的突出问题。

685
00:34:22,254 --> 00:34:25,032
也许，我会探讨这个问题，这可能听起来有些奇怪，

686
00:34:25,056 --> 00:34:28,269
但我会说是“表象的地位”，

687
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:32,524
因为另一种方式可以用一个公式来概括，

688
00:34:32,548 --> 00:34:36,670
黑格尔的伟大之处在于，

689
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:39,798
通常的问题，即使对康德来说，

690
00:34:39,822 --> 00:34:42,829
问题总是我们是否受限于我们的约束，

691
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,704
我们的表象世界，我们能否超越这些，

692
00:34:47,728 --> 00:34:52,308
达到事物的真实本质。

693
00:34:53,112 --> 00:34:56,949
而黑格尔的问题正好相反。

694
00:34:57,392 --> 00:35:00,206
真正的奇迹，那就是否定性的奇迹。

695
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:05,170
为什么现实不仅仅是平坦的现实？

696
00:35:05,491 --> 00:35:08,188
现实如何能够显现给它自己？

697
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,908
因为表象意味着一个可怕的鸿沟——

698
00:35:11,351 --> 00:35:13,949
事物并不是直接就是它们自身，

699
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:15,788
它们要向自己显现。

700
00:35:16,091 --> 00:35:18,529
现在，如果你敢于使用它，

701
00:35:20,093 --> 00:35:22,498
我在这里是绝对的黑格尔主义者。

702
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:27,710
最基本的反思性、表象，是绝对普遍的。

703
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,498
对我来说，现在我将跳到另一个话题。

704
00:35:30,498 --> 00:35:34,309
量子物理学的教训是，表象很重要。

705
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,160
你如何衡量它，事物的表象决定了事物的本质，

706
00:35:38,184 --> 00:35:40,710
现在你可以使用它，也可以不使用它。

707
00:35:41,294 --> 00:35:43,227
这基本上是一个翻译问题吗？

708
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:46,908
不是，尽管在某种意义上有翻译。

709
00:35:48,176 --> 00:35:50,675
一个想要更认真地成为哲学家的人

710
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:52,529
必须在这里非常精确。

711
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:55,928
现象并不等同于Herpsheimer。

712
00:35:56,432 --> 00:35:58,650
我是指在语言方面，我是指在领域方面。

713
00:35:58,911 --> 00:36:03,237
当你谈论量子层面时，存在一个鸿沟。

714
00:36:05,471 --> 00:36:08,630
我知道，我完全反对那些简化主义者的观点，

715
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:12,508
他们想要某种方式将人类自由的可能性

716
00:36:12,532 --> 00:36:16,849
直接建立在现实的不确定性上，

717
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:18,747
但我不是在谈论这个，

718
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:21,688
我谈论的是真正吸引我的东西，

719
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:26,500
这在量子物理学中是一个非常抽象的哲学观点，

720
00:36:27,414 --> 00:36:32,809
我在我的书中多次提到这个想法

721
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,708
这个观点是现实的本体不完整性，

722
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:41,010
它不像列宁和天真的唯物主义者所想的那样，

723
00:36:41,471 --> 00:36:44,329
现实存在于外部，完全真实，

724
00:36:44,353 --> 00:36:47,210
我们只是无法完全了解它。

725
00:36:47,511 --> 00:36:51,796
如果现实本身以某种方式围绕着这个鸿沟构建，

726
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,650
不是完全真实的呢？

727
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,179
你知道我最喜欢的一个故事，

728
00:36:55,203 --> 00:36:57,070
也许你的读者知道，

729
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:59,599
它是我最喜欢的故事

730
00:36:59,623 --> 00:37:01,930
我在一本流行的哲学导论中找到的，

731
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:09,810
那个人试图基于视频游戏来解读量子物理，

732
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:12,757
你知道，在视频游戏中，当你沉浸在游戏中时，

733
00:37:12,781 --> 00:37:15,708
那里的现实并没有完全构成。

734
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,427
例如，如果背景中有一片森林，

735
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:22,350
而这片森林不是游戏的一部分，

736
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,204
那么你不能进入那片森林，

737
00:37:25,228 --> 00:37:26,778
其中所有的树木都没有被详细编程，

738
00:37:26,802 --> 00:37:27,961
甚至大多数房屋也是如此。

739
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:31,023
如果你只看到房子的外观，

740
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:34,030
而这些房子不是游戏的一部分，你不能进入房子，

741
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,837
那么我们非常清楚，

742
00:37:35,861 --> 00:37:40,050
这些房子在计算机程序中并没有被完全构建出来。

743
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:44,068
而这个家伙的想法，

744
00:37:44,092 --> 00:37:47,989
我很喜欢，就是

745
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,548
为什么游戏程序员

746
00:37:50,572 --> 00:37:52,870
没有构建一个完整的现实？

747
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,498
因为那只是浪费时间，没有意义。

748
00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:58,630
当一个房子不是

749
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,800
你进入的游戏的一部分时

750
00:38:00,824 --> 00:38:03,310
为什么要编程它的内部，是不是？

751
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:06,157
最简单而又奇妙的一个想法是，

752
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:09,008
上帝在创造宇宙时也做了同样的事情。

753
00:38:09,431 --> 00:38:11,364
他在亚原子层面就停止了，

754
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:16,607
因为他认为我们人类太愚蠢，无法进展到那么远，

755
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,684
或者说我们无法超越原子层面。

756
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:23,089
所以为什么我还要费心去编程速度和位置呢？

757
00:38:23,451 --> 00:38:27,966
这个想法是一个非常有趣的讽刺观点，即上帝低估了我们，

758
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:31,396
我们通过量子物理学，好像抓到了上帝的破绽，

759
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,486
你知道的，啊，你猜错了。

760
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:38,257
但现在来到了对我来说真正的唯物主义定义。

761
00:38:38,257 --> 00:38:42,148
我们可以不需要上帝来思考这种不完整性。

762
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,354
你不需要一个创造者。

763
00:38:44,354 --> 00:38:46,761
现实本身就是不完整的。

764
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:50,934
这是一个重大的结果，然后还有许多其他结果。

765
00:38:50,934 --> 00:38:53,321
所以你看，我在这里非常小心。

766
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:55,267
我不试图向物理学家们传授知识。

767
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:02,536
我只是试图提供唯物主义的，甚至是哲学的解读，

768
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:10,129
而且它全部集中在表象的地位上。

769
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:14,804
再次，正如黑格尔所说，真正的问题是表象如何出现，

770
00:39:14,828 --> 00:39:19,187
或者他和其他德国唯心主义者所说的，

771
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:23,329
问题不是我们是否

772
00:39:23,353 --> 00:39:26,289
陷入了我们的主观性，

773
00:39:26,313 --> 00:39:29,250
问题是现实本身必须如何构建，

774
00:39:29,274 --> 00:39:32,210
以便能够产生像主观性、

775
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:35,983
主观表象这样的东西。

776
00:39:35,983 --> 00:39:38,190
你知道，外面的世界和地球上，

777
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:43,464
是否必须存在某种反思性、不完整性和否定性呢？

778
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,449
黑格尔明确提出了这个问题，

779
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,615
这就是为什么，

780
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:51,050
这就是为什么现在来这样一个挑衅，

781
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:55,338
在美国他们会说这是触发警告，来理解它。

782
00:39:55,362 --> 00:39:59,389
最近我的一个朋友给我看了一些，我真的是这么认为，

783
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:02,429
我不是在否认当我年轻时

784
00:40:02,453 --> 00:40:05,050
我没有看过硬核色情，但我的一个朋友

785
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:09,128
向我展示了一些典型的硬核异性恋场景，

786
00:40:09,152 --> 00:40:12,969
我们分析了这些场景，

787
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:17,851
得出了事情远比看上去复杂得多的结论，

788
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:22,276
比如说这是传统的针对男性的硬核色情，

789
00:40:22,276 --> 00:40:26,125
不，女性并没有被简单地还原为一个对象。

790
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:27,888
不，女性是唯一的主体。

791
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,175
典型场景是这样的：

792
00:40:30,175 --> 00:40:32,443
女性被侵入，

793
00:40:32,443 --> 00:40:34,449
男性则被简化为纯粹的工具。

794
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,367
我们找到了许多电影，

795
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:40,027
在这些电影中你甚至看不到男性的脸，他并不重要。

796
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,128
所以典型的场景是这样的：

797
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,318
好吧，这是因为你采取了男性的视角，

798
00:40:43,342 --> 00:40:44,369
这就是原因。

799
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,374
不，我不这么认为。

800
00:40:45,374 --> 00:40:48,165
我会告诉你你采取了哪种视角。

801
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:53,065
你在前面看到的是男性的阴茎正在侵入女性，

802
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:57,989
女性双腿大幅度张开，

803
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,507
然后在她大腿之间的背景里，

804
00:41:00,531 --> 00:41:02,648
你总是能看到她的脸盯着摄像机，

805
00:41:02,672 --> 00:41:05,252
或至少是展示她的脸。更复杂的一个。

806
00:41:05,252 --> 00:41:08,441
所以我认为你并没有与男性产生认同。

807
00:41:08,441 --> 00:41:11,028
你认同的是你自己作为一个观众。

808
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:14,575
你寻找的不是你的快乐，

809
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:17,190
而是确认女性的享受。

810
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:20,141
所以这对女性来说并不是更好。

811
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:22,410
我认为这种方式甚至更加羞辱了女性，

812
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,614
我并不喜欢。

813
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,422
我想说的是，即使在这里，

814
00:41:25,446 --> 00:41:27,710
当你想到，天哪，这只是性行为，

815
00:41:27,911 --> 00:41:31,530
无论结构如何，那都是最低限度的反思。

816
00:41:33,031 --> 00:41:35,966
如果你只展示从近景的性器官相互侵入，

817
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:39,470
这可能意味着粗俗且无聊。

818
00:41:39,972 --> 00:41:45,710
必须是女性回视，这对她来说非常羞辱。

819
00:41:46,192 --> 00:41:49,946
她必须做的，我不会详细讨论，所有的声音等等。

820
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,922
但我想说的是，你看到了，

821
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:59,227
在最直接的性压力中，结构更为复杂。

822
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:04,237
确实，

823
00:42:04,261 --> 00:42:05,877
量子物理学的一个教训也是

824
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:08,602
测量并不仅仅是测量外部存在的某种现实。

825
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,509
在某种程度上，测量部分地构成了现实。

826
00:42:13,852 --> 00:42:14,587
但是如何呢？

827
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:18,251
测量并不构成现实，

828
00:42:18,275 --> 00:42:21,730
测量构成了我们观察现实的方式，对吧？

829
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,473
这有点更激进。

830
00:42:23,473 --> 00:42:26,045
在这里，存在一个冲突，我是说，

831
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:28,641
讽刺地，介于海森堡和尼尔斯·玻尔之间。

832
00:42:35,413 --> 00:42:37,011
海森堡认为他的不确定性原理

833
00:42:37,035 --> 00:42:38,549
仅是认识论的。

834
00:42:39,654 --> 00:42:43,730
我们不能同时测量一个粒子的速度和位置。

835
00:42:44,452 --> 00:42:47,108
玻尔批评了他，玻尔声称，不，

836
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:49,787
这种不确定性存在于事物本身。

837
00:42:51,413 --> 00:42:54,428
粒子在同一时间并不存在确定的状态。

838
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:58,043
因此，问题在于对表象和效果的测量

839
00:42:58,067 --> 00:43:01,289
在某种程度上会影响现实本身。

840
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:05,710
问题在于如何以非唯心主义的方式解读这一点。

841
00:43:06,011 --> 00:43:07,829
你知道的，避免所有的废话，

842
00:43:07,853 --> 00:43:09,670
即，哦，一定有一个头脑来构建。

843
00:43:10,552 --> 00:43:13,488
也许这与现实的结构有关，

844
00:43:13,512 --> 00:43:16,447
但也许也与我们对现实的期望有关，你说呢？

845
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:21,411
好吧，但我还是同意你的观点，

846
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:25,845
但我还是要在这里补充黑格尔的观点。

847
00:43:25,845 --> 00:43:28,149
不要把现实放在那里，而把我们放在这里。

848
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:31,852
现实是如何构成的，

849
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:35,489
以至于我们对现实的期望能够影响现实？

850
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,688
不过好吧，不要偏题，谢谢。

851
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,409
你看，哪些问题正困扰着我。

852
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:41,062
当然。

853
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:44,406
是啊，所以我基本上是个老古董、

854
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,649
我甚至想说老派哲学家。

855
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:51,065
我认为我们还没有真正超越黑格尔。

856
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:55,871
黑格尔之后出现的是各种不同的超验主义，

857
00:43:55,895 --> 00:44:00,028
甚至是最具创造性的马克思主义。

858
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:03,668
因此，我们奉行超验主义。

859
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:06,349
人类的集体实践是，

860
00:44:06,373 --> 00:44:08,990
我们如何感知的最终超越性视界。

861
00:44:09,331 --> 00:44:11,068
他们要么是超验主义者，

862
00:44:11,092 --> 00:44:12,829
要么是庸俗幼稚的唯物主义者。

863
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:14,314
好的，非常感谢。

864
00:44:14,314 --> 00:44:16,372
我想接着说，

865
00:44:16,396 --> 00:44:18,849
这样我们至少可以非常简短地谈谈您的新书。

866
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,557
我又出新书了。

867
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:22,185
我不知道你是怎么做到的，但是...

868
00:44:23,251 --> 00:44:23,773
我作弊。

869
00:44:23,773 --> 00:44:24,196
我作弊。

870
00:44:24,196 --> 00:44:25,763
我一直在模仿自己。

871
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,030
许多政治书籍...

872
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:27,895
不，不，不

873
00:44:27,895 --> 00:44:29,929
这不像人们想的那样，你每天写 20 页吗？

874
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:31,194
不，不，不

875
00:44:31,194 --> 00:44:35,010
我的作品非常人性化，或者用讽刺的语言来说，就像某人

876
00:44:35,171 --> 00:44:38,623
斯洛特迪克写的东西比我多三、四倍。

877
00:44:38,623 --> 00:44:40,229
别担心。

878
00:44:40,972 --> 00:44:43,909
现在，你的新书出版了，我还没读过，

879
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:46,870
因为我还没来得及看到它，但它已经准时出版了。

880
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:50,850
如果你们今天愿意，我可以把最终校样送给你们。

881
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:51,584
你真是太好了

882
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,879
不 我向你保证

883
00:44:54,879 --> 00:44:58,270
你会看到我已经见过面了，如果我们再次见面，我向你保证、

884
00:44:58,674 --> 00:45:02,290
我永远不会问你，你已经有时间读了吗？

885
00:45:02,714 --> 00:45:04,149
我讨厌这样做的作者

886
00:45:04,694 --> 00:45:07,147
给你我的书，但你会得到它们

887
00:45:07,391 --> 00:45:09,250
哦，你已经读过了吗？

888
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:09,882
对不起，请继续

889
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:10,963
我们也会读的

890
00:45:11,372 --> 00:45:12,948
因此，这本书的书名就叫

891
00:45:12,972 --> 00:45:15,270
《虚空的失禁--经济哲学琐记》

892
00:45:15,514 --> 00:45:16,270
现在，好了

893
00:45:16,752 --> 00:45:19,647
因此，我只看了这个简短的摘要

894
00:45:20,652 --> 00:45:23,627
也就是说，你探索了哲学，

895
00:45:23,651 --> 00:45:27,290
精神分析和政治经济学批判之间的空白

896
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,907
现在，我们来谈谈“拱肩”...（译注：在进化生物学中，spandrel是一种表型特征，它是某些其他特征进化的副产品，而不是适应性选择的直接产物）

897
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:33,290
这是史蒂文-K-古尔德等人的术语，

898
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:36,230
我很熟悉这个词，它来自建筑学

899
00:45:36,612 --> 00:45:39,270
但却在进化生物学中找到了用武之地

900
00:45:40,035 --> 00:45:42,250
不过，是的，但是，谈论拱肩的确意味着

901
00:45:42,632 --> 00:45:46,189
你必须假设那些学科的完整性。

902
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,301
所以如果你试图找到那些空间……

903
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:50,059
我对此表示怀疑，为什么？

904
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:51,533
如果你试图找到这些空间，

905
00:45:51,557 --> 00:45:53,209
那么你必须假设拱门的存在，不是吗？

906
00:45:53,995 --> 00:45:56,089
我会用黑格尔的方式来表述，

907
00:45:56,573 --> 00:45:57,603
对不起，我能帮上什么忙吗？

908
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:00,700
你看，事情总是让我紧张。

909
00:46:04,293 --> 00:46:10,869
我的解决方案是，如果

910
00:46:11,431 --> 00:46:13,329
一切存在都需要一个拱肩，

911
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,250
需要一个可以转化的空白处。

912
00:46:15,631 --> 00:46:18,439
例如，在古尔德的论文中，

913
00:46:18,463 --> 00:46:21,270
你没有所谓的完整的有机体，

914
00:46:21,572 --> 00:46:24,109
因为会偶然地出现拱肩之类的。

915
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:28,670
根据古尔德的说法，整个进化都是基于拱肩的。

916
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:31,117
你有反空间，你有无用的器官，

917
00:46:31,141 --> 00:46:33,548
就像附属物一样。

918
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,368
是的，但它们是事物的副产品，

919
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:37,546
被推动向……

920
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:42,349
是的，但他的观点在这里真的很激进，

921
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:46,118
这种不平衡，意味着产品从来、

922
00:46:46,142 --> 00:46:49,769
从来没有完全符合其功能。

923
00:46:50,471 --> 00:46:52,218
有一个副产品元素，

924
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:53,989
他追求到底，古尔德的美在于

925
00:46:54,331 --> 00:46:58,090
他以这种方式解释了人类语言。

926
00:46:58,432 --> 00:47:01,009
它是一个副产品，本不应该如此。

927
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:05,648
但是一个由实际被适应性价值驱动的事物的副产品，

928
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:08,904
所以还有其他具有适应性价值的事物，

929
00:47:10,231 --> 00:47:14,090
因此你必须假设这些事物的存在，以便拥有拱肩。

930
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:16,009
是的，但对他来说，适应是通过拱肩来实现的。

931
00:47:16,393 --> 00:47:17,343
这就是我的看法。

932
00:47:18,612 --> 00:47:21,825
是的，但矛盾在于，

933
00:47:23,411 --> 00:47:26,618
事物本身永远无法完全实现功能，甚至在概念上也不行，

934
00:47:26,642 --> 00:47:28,690
你需要副产品，你一直需要副产品，

935
00:47:28,871 --> 00:47:31,229
我们整个人类的进步，

936
00:47:31,253 --> 00:47:33,490
甚至在动物王国中，

937
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:37,178
达尔文的伟大之处也是基于副产品。

938
00:47:37,202 --> 00:47:40,770
回到我的书上，

939
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:45,429
我会这样说，

940
00:47:45,453 --> 00:47:49,590
我认为从一开始，

941
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:59,289
好吧，我这样说，

942
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:01,908
现代哲学发生了一些事情，

943
00:48:01,932 --> 00:48:04,249
通过现代哲学我在这里有点老派，

944
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:08,378
我指的是康德后康德以及康德后思想，

945
00:48:08,402 --> 00:48:12,249
它与其他领域有特殊的联系，

946
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,858
例如与精神分析学。

947
00:48:15,858 --> 00:48:21,412
我声称，弗洛伊德不仅仅是一个实证科学家。

948
00:48:21,412 --> 00:48:26,122
这可能是我工作的基本论点。

949
00:48:26,122 --> 00:48:29,609
弗洛伊德所隐含的哲学或哲学立场，

950
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:33,453
并不是某种简单的自然主义，

951
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:36,730
即性是重要的。

952
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:44,669
它是一种关于人的观点，与康德哲学或德国理想主义相契合。

953
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:46,444
因此，对我来说，

954
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:50,268
我的终极任务就是在精神分析带给我们的背景下，

955
00:48:50,292 --> 00:48:56,607
重新解读德国的唯心主义。

956
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:01,809
因为精神分析是一件更为微妙的事情。

957
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,117
它并不是潜意识的实体主义，

958
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:05,888
所有这些愚蠢的隐喻。

959
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:11,186
意识的自我只是冰山一角，所有的死亡都在那里。

960
00:49:11,186 --> 00:49:15,398
不，对弗洛伊德来说，潜意识纯粹是现象性的。

961
00:49:15,398 --> 00:49:18,889
荣格对潜意识有一个实体性的概念。

962
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:18,989
那么

963
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:24,458
再次强调，简单来说，我的观点是，

964
00:49:24,482 --> 00:49:29,489
只有通过德国唯心主义来解读精神分析

965
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:33,127
我们才能真正理解精神分析革命的含义，

966
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:37,610
反之亦然。

967
00:49:39,294 --> 00:49:42,000
只有通过重新阅读弗洛伊德，

968
00:49:42,024 --> 00:49:44,730
我们才能保持德国唯心主义传统的活力。

969
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:49,479
在这里，我作为一名左翼马克思主义者，

970
00:49:49,503 --> 00:49:53,790
认为这一点比马克思本人还要重要。

971
00:49:54,171 --> 00:49:56,974
我认为，哲学上马克思继承了费尔巴哈等人，

972
00:49:56,998 --> 00:50:00,160
相对于黑格尔而言是一种倒退。

973
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:04,155
但当你问我的时候，我的观点是这样的，

974
00:50:04,179 --> 00:50:07,623
现在我只能给你一个非常简洁的版本。

975
00:50:08,351 --> 00:50:11,519
这个想法是我和我的好朋友

976
00:50:11,543 --> 00:50:15,189
Jobkopjek共同想到的，

977
00:50:15,931 --> 00:50:20,608
拉康在他的《第二十讲座：再来一次》中

978
00:50:20,632 --> 00:50:22,183
讨论了女性的享乐以及其他一些主题，

979
00:50:22,207 --> 00:50:25,596
发展了他那著名或者臭名昭著的情境公式。

980
00:50:25,596 --> 00:50:30,249
他希望通过一些逻辑悖论、普遍性及其例外等

981
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:35,685
来解释男性与女性的性别差异。

982
00:50:35,685 --> 00:50:40,106
约翰·科瓦奇最初提出了这个想法，

983
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:44,550
即拉康在那里描述的内容，他自己并未意识到，

984
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:48,258
我向认识拉康的人确认过，

985
00:50:48,282 --> 00:50:51,869
这些正是康德反经验的结构。

986
00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:57,796
拉康称之为男性的是动态反经验，

987
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:04,596
他称之为女性的是数学反经验。

988
00:51:04,596 --> 00:51:07,298
所以，当然，我不是在谈论生物学上的性别，

989
00:51:07,322 --> 00:51:11,010
我在讨论为什么我们的宇宙，

990
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:15,919
甚至是最抽象的概念下的宇宙，是有性别的，

991
00:51:15,943 --> 00:51:21,155
这是因为符号化等方面的某些悖论。

992
00:51:21,155 --> 00:51:26,546
我的第二点是，这种康德式的反经验结构作为最终的视界，

993
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:31,503
我们无法超越它们。

994
00:51:31,503 --> 00:51:33,730
康德的错误在于，

995
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:36,467
正如黑格尔在他对康德的著名批评中所说，

996
00:51:36,491 --> 00:51:39,087
康德对事物过于温和。

997
00:51:39,087 --> 00:51:42,460
对他来说，反经验仅限于我们的知识。

998
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:46,053
反经验不能是事物本身的属性。

999
00:51:46,053 --> 00:51:49,303
黑格尔的观点是，它们可以是。

1000
00:51:49,303 --> 00:51:53,995
所以我将尝试通过这种方式，

1001
00:51:54,019 --> 00:51:58,710
认真对待康德的反经验，认为它们关乎事物本身，

1002
00:51:59,312 --> 00:52:02,198
来解读隐含的康德

1003
00:52:02,222 --> 00:52:05,029
和黑格尔的本体论，

1004
00:52:05,053 --> 00:52:07,899
这符合我即兴提出的，

1005
00:52:07,923 --> 00:52:10,769
未完成的宇宙等概念。

1006
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:14,448
这意味着世界本身是反经验的，

1007
00:52:14,472 --> 00:52:19,206
没有完全构成等等。

1008
00:52:19,206 --> 00:52:22,794
在这里我们找到了与弗洛伊德、

1009
00:52:22,818 --> 00:52:26,405
性别、性别差异和本体论的联系。

1010
00:52:26,405 --> 00:52:28,368
我讲得很快，你可能不会被说服。

1011
00:52:28,392 --> 00:52:30,919
我只是给你一个大纲。

1012
00:52:30,919 --> 00:52:34,641
我的下一步是作为一个老派的马克思主义者，

1013
00:52:34,665 --> 00:52:36,889
但这是基于黑格尔的信念，

1014
00:52:36,913 --> 00:52:40,068
尽管如此，资本主义是某种异常现象。

1015
00:52:40,068 --> 00:52:42,869
这里我们回到你提到的铲子等问题，

1016
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:46,430
即我们在资本主义中发现的剩余价值的逻辑，

1017
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:52,788
其中事物不能没有它的剩余而存在。

1018
00:52:52,788 --> 00:52:56,136
看似次要的剩余实际上是驱动因素，

1019
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,508
是触发它的东西。

1020
00:52:59,508 --> 00:53:03,312
在书的第二部分，

1021
00:53:03,336 --> 00:53:06,635
我详细讨论了拉康所称的剩余享乐与享受中

1022
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:07,750
额外的扭曲之间的对应关系，

1023
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:13,524
这种扭曲将简单的快乐转变为

1024
00:53:13,548 --> 00:53:18,940
我们通常用更强调的术语称呼的享乐。

1025
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:23,053
我希望其中的一些例子会是有趣的。

1026
00:53:23,053 --> 00:53:27,644
例如，对我来说，让我着迷的是，

1027
00:53:27,668 --> 00:53:32,916
我给你们举了一个可怕的政治例子，在痛苦中享受。

1028
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:36,646
你知道，我的天，你一定知道戈培尔的《全面战争演讲》。

1029
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:40,495
他以一种可怕的方式做了一些天才的事，

1030
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:42,904
在1943年初在柏林体育宫。

1031
00:53:42,904 --> 00:53:48,462
他向德国人民承诺的只有更多的苦难。

1032
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:51,677
他说，你们想要一场战争吗，

1033
00:53:51,701 --> 00:53:54,335
一场你们无法想象将会遭受多少苦难的全面战争，

1034
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:55,229
而人们可以……

1035
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:58,828
因此，关于痛苦中的快乐的这些悖论，

1036
00:53:58,852 --> 00:54:02,050
或者我所声称的是，对于某种类型的性，

1037
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,638
我现在跳一个话题，

1038
00:54:04,662 --> 00:54:07,150
为了给出一些例子，

1039
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:09,975
可能是新教徒的性行为方式，

1040
00:54:09,999 --> 00:54:13,387
如果你不感到内疚，你就不会真正享受它。

1041
00:54:13,387 --> 00:54:18,128
你必须在快乐中加入负罪感，才能真正享受快乐。

1042
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:24,644
我认为，所有这些曲折都说明，

1043
00:54:24,668 --> 00:54:30,710
障碍远非阻碍，而是条件，让你不断前进。

1044
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:32,995
举个例子，很抱歉，

1045
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:36,162
这会显得性别歧视，但我喜欢这个例子。

1046
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:38,205
我的一个朋友告诉我这个故事，

1047
00:54:38,229 --> 00:54:39,504
也许你甚至知道。是怎么回事呢，

1048
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:42,887
他告诉我他和一个年长的女士有过一段情事，

1049
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:46,886
那位女士有一个漂亮的身体，

1050
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:50,850
但她告诉他，

1051
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:53,408
她的上一个情人在看到她赤裸的身体后告诉她，

1052
00:54:53,432 --> 00:54:55,910
除了多出的一两公斤，她的身体是完美的。

1053
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:58,093
我的朋友做出了正确的反应，

1054
00:54:58,117 --> 00:55:00,570
他告诉她不要减掉那一两公斤，

1055
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:02,541
因为悖论在于，

1056
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:04,810
你必须多出那一两公斤，

1057
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:10,406
这样你才能创造出一个幻觉：没有那多出的两公斤，

1058
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:12,821
你的身体就是完美的。

1059
00:55:12,821 --> 00:55:15,516
但如果你真的减掉那一两公斤，

1060
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:18,622
你也会失去那种完美

1061
00:55:18,622 --> 00:55:20,670
这种根本的不平衡，

1062
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:25,637
这种扰乱和谐的剩余，

1063
00:55:25,661 --> 00:55:29,856
正是和谐的追溯性条件。

1064
00:55:29,856 --> 00:55:33,807
马克思意识到了这一点，但他还不够激进。

1065
00:55:33,807 --> 00:55:36,496
马克思对共产主义的梦想是，

1066
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,209
我们可以获得资本主义的动态，

1067
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:43,905
永远扩张，但没有障碍，没有这种悖论。

1068
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:45,140
好的，这更复杂了。

1069
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,684
但我想说的是，对我来说，

1070
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:52,468
资本主义在这个意义上是一种本体现象。

1071
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:57,227
它是人类历史上第一个也是唯一一个

1072
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:00,947
把不平衡视为解决方案而非问题的社会秩序。

1073
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:04,310
这就是为什么马克思主义者

1074
00:56:04,334 --> 00:56:07,532
总是对资本主义有意见，他们总是指望危机，

1075
00:56:07,556 --> 00:56:09,811
但是资本主义越是处于危机中，

1076
00:56:09,835 --> 00:56:12,430
它就越能强劲地从中崛起。

1077
00:56:12,891 --> 00:56:17,670
所以我处理了资本主义的这些本体论后果，

1078
00:56:17,694 --> 00:56:22,472
然后在最后做了一些非常悲观的事情。

1079
00:56:22,472 --> 00:56:25,333
我认为，在经典的马克思主义观点中，

1080
00:56:25,357 --> 00:56:29,908
当你认为无产阶级革命将

1081
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:34,922
不会被这种资产阶级僵局所限制时，你想要的自由，

1082
00:56:34,946 --> 00:56:39,557
结果是灾难性的，知道这一点。

1083
00:56:39,557 --> 00:56:44,250
我们必须接受所有革命，甚至是无产阶级革命，

1084
00:56:44,274 --> 00:56:48,966
都被困在它们无法主宰的过程中。

1085
00:56:48,966 --> 00:56:52,236
比如，你想要像十月革命那样的革命，好吧，

1086
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:55,530
我们可以玩这个游戏，它本意是伟大的，

1087
00:56:55,691 --> 00:56:58,463
但不管怎样，它是一次巨大的解放尝试。

1088
00:56:58,463 --> 00:57:00,089
没有可控的革命。

1089
00:57:00,311 --> 00:57:00,472
什么？

1090
00:57:00,472 --> 00:57:01,763
没有可控的革命。

1091
00:57:01,763 --> 00:57:03,614
是的，没有可控的革命。

1092
00:57:03,614 --> 00:57:07,207
我们必须，我们必须接受，这是一种非常黑格尔式的观点，

1093
00:57:07,231 --> 00:57:10,824
因为你知道，马克思在这里从字面上看是更唯心主义的。

1094
00:57:10,824 --> 00:57:14,185
马克思认为，你可以在早期的一些资料中找到这一点，

1095
00:57:14,209 --> 00:57:17,570
这仍然是20世纪最伟大的书籍之一《历史和阶级意识》，

1096
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:20,553
马克思认为无产阶级革命

1097
00:57:20,577 --> 00:57:23,149
将是一个自我透明的行动。

1098
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:26,229
在那个历史时刻，工人阶级，作为主体，

1099
00:57:26,253 --> 00:57:29,051
将知道自己在做什么并去做它。

1100
00:57:29,051 --> 00:57:31,053
不，正如你很好地表达的，

1101
00:57:31,077 --> 00:57:33,507
它不是可控的，不是自我透明的。

1102
00:57:33,507 --> 00:57:36,819
你在历史辩证法中看到了相同的动态。

1103
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:40,190
在书的最后，我讨论了我非常喜欢的一些问题，

1104
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:43,498
关于共产主义中的死亡问题。

1105
00:57:43,522 --> 00:57:47,509
尽管我不喜欢，

1106
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:50,968
我不仅仅是在对抗革命的透明性，

1107
00:57:50,992 --> 00:57:54,430
还在对抗那些以某种方式认为

1108
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:57,548
在共产主义下私人生活会更好的观点。

1109
00:57:57,572 --> 00:58:00,590
我声称不，谁知道，也许情况会更糟。

1110
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,938
你知道，我喜欢举例子，

1111
00:58:02,962 --> 00:58:05,210
我想跳到另一例子，

1112
00:58:07,334 --> 00:58:11,430
肖斯塔科维奇的第十四交响曲

1113
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:15,550
这实际上是一部关于死亡和垂死的交响曲，

1114
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:18,988
它是如此公开地、无耻地悲观，

1115
00:58:19,012 --> 00:58:22,349
难怪他在生前没能演出它。

1116
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:27,256
所以再次说，

1117
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,981
我认为我们应该在不背叛马克思主义的情况下

1118
00:58:30,005 --> 00:58:31,756
引入所谓的“历史密度”。

1119
00:58:31,756 --> 00:58:33,836
在所有社会过程中，

1120
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,789
包括进步的过程，它们都是不透明的，

1121
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:40,917
结果是另一个结果等等，

1122
00:58:40,941 --> 00:58:45,213
这意味着从根本上我们永远不知道我们在做什么。

1123
00:58:45,213 --> 00:58:47,450
行为本质上是被置换的，

1124
00:58:47,474 --> 00:58:49,710
你得到的是别的东西等等。

1125
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:54,207
这实际上是结束这个特定部分的一个好注脚。

1126
00:58:54,207 --> 00:58:57,467
我正要问你最后一个问题，

1127
00:58:57,491 --> 00:59:00,750
所以可能会有很多读者或者人们实际上看到这个视频，

1128
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:02,928
他们会说哦，应该去了解他，

1129
00:59:02,952 --> 00:59:05,050
他是一个真正有趣的人，那么他们应该读些什么呢？

1130
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:07,749
你知道要推荐你的众多书籍中的哪一本，

1131
00:59:07,773 --> 00:59:10,270
或者如果他们有时间和意愿，

1132
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:14,428
要阅读哪些哲学书籍，

1133
00:59:14,452 --> 00:59:18,489
比如我写过一本关于事件的短哲学书

1134
00:59:19,111 --> 00:59:21,987
《Erignis》（事件），它也被翻译成德语，

1135
00:59:22,011 --> 00:59:25,390
正是试图探讨所有维度的海德格尔事件

1136
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:29,038
最终的灾难事件，

1137
00:59:29,062 --> 00:59:32,589
世界末日的事件，堕落的事件，

1138
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,766
然后是三位伟大的哲学家，

1139
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:38,430
对我来说他们是

1140
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,456
柏拉图、笛卡尔、黑格尔，为什么呢？

1141
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,703
因为他们每个人都定义了整个后代，

1142
00:59:44,727 --> 00:59:46,950
就像米歇尔·福柯在某处所说的，

1143
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:50,638
整个哲学史难道不是对柏拉图的批评历史，

1144
00:59:50,662 --> 00:59:54,190
以及在笛卡尔之后，

1145
00:59:54,351 --> 00:59:56,979
他们都想摆脱笛卡尔，

1146
00:59:57,003 --> 00:59:59,630
19世纪他们都想摆脱黑格尔，如何做呢？

1147
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:02,649
我认为他们都是事件的哲学家，

1148
01:00:02,673 --> 01:00:05,530
笛卡尔的“我思”不是他错误地认为的思维实体，

1149
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:09,918
而是一种纯粹的自我关联事件，

1150
01:00:09,942 --> 01:00:12,850
希腊的也是如此。所以我会说

1151
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:15,909
如果你有更多的精力，

1152
01:00:15,933 --> 01:00:19,550
稍微多读一点《绝对反弹》，

1153
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:22,771
也请去读这些哲学书，

1154
01:00:22,795 --> 01:00:26,590
这是我的真正工作所在，

1155
01:00:26,771 --> 01:00:29,358
所有像我刚刚出版的

1156
01:00:29,382 --> 01:00:31,969
《无望的勇气》等哲学作品，

1157
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:35,768
听着，当我做这些工作的时候，

1158
01:00:35,792 --> 01:00:39,329
我是带着某种萨特所说的坏良心做的，你知道的。

1159
01:00:39,851 --> 01:00:42,798
就好像应该是别人在做这件事，我对社会、

1160
01:00:42,822 --> 01:00:45,709
政治了解多少呢，我是个业余爱好者，

1161
01:00:46,071 --> 01:00:49,950
我总有种感觉应该是别人在做这件事，

1162
01:00:49,974 --> 01:00:54,236
而不是我，我只是在替别人填补空缺。

1163
01:00:54,236 --> 01:00:57,524
我对我写的政治书感到不安。

1164
01:00:57,524 --> 01:01:02,080
我的心真正所在的只是那些更纯粹的哲学书籍。

1165
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,889
非常感谢，太棒了。

1166
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:06,368
但现在你应该成为一个好记者，我会的，

1167
01:01:06,392 --> 01:01:08,590
好的，好吧，采访者，知道我是怎么定义的。

1168
01:01:09,513 --> 01:01:12,329
每个傻瓜，我希望你们两个不是，

1169
01:01:12,353 --> 01:01:15,169
都可以复述我说的话。

1170
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:18,118
一个真正的记者能做到这一点。

1171
01:01:18,118 --> 01:01:19,664
你不作弊。

1172
01:01:19,664 --> 01:01:21,149
你只使用我所说的话。

1173
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:24,588
但你把它与其他问题结合起来，并进行剪辑，

1174
01:01:24,612 --> 01:01:27,590
使得你让我说出完全不同的东西，

1175
01:01:28,515 --> 01:01:29,560
但我不能抱怨。

1176
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,418
你说，滚开，虽然对不起，

1177
01:01:30,442 --> 01:01:31,590
但这些话确实是从你嘴里说出来的。

1178
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:32,600
这就是挑战。

1179
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,489
非常感谢。

1180
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:34,641
这就是挑战。
