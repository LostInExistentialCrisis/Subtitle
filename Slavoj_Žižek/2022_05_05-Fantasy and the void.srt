00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:01,066
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:03,200
Welcome to Fantasy in the Void.

3
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:07,366
I'm Wes Alwan, co-host of the Partially Examined Life Philosophy podcast.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,366
In a survey of academic philosophers, 85% identified as atheists.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,533
In Europe, established religion has been in decline for a century.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,133
Even in the States, attendance is falling.

7
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:27,133
Yet globally, religion remains a potent force, and predictions of its demise have not materialized.

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:35,266
Among those who have abandoned established religion, new forms of spirituality, such as mindfulness and yoga, are on the rise.

9
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:44,533
Does religion, in all of its many forms, provide a psychological support for humans that makes it essential, without which there is only the void?

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,866
Is there something about being that is ineffable and which can never be eradicated?

11
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:58,166
Or is the persistence of religion an extended but ultimately temporary phenomenon that will be replaced by the success of science.

12
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:07,700
Today we are joined by Rupert Sheldrake who is a scientist, author, and parapsychology researcher best known for his 2012 book

13
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,033
The Science Delusion and controversial viral TED Talk he gave which was later banned by the organization.

14
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:26,200
Slavoj Zizek is a Hegelian psychoanalyst and arguably the leading celebrity philosopher of our times, idiosyncratic and fiercely polemical,

15
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,733
Sahoui is currently serving as international director of the Burbank Institute for the Humanities,

16
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:44,500
and Jennifer Ratner Rosenhagen is professor of history at the University of Madison, Wisconsin, known for her work on Nietzsche and the transatlantic flow of intellectual movements.

17
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,900
Her books include American Nietzsche and The Ideas That Made America, which was first published in 2019.

18
00:01:49,900 --> 00:02:00,033
We'll start with the question for which each speaker has three minutes to present their thoughts before we move into the body of the debate.

19
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:08,833
That question is, is the persistence of religion a temporary phenomenon that will eventually be replaced by science?

20
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,200
Okay, let's begin with Rupert.

21
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:19,500
Well, what makes religions different from mechanistic materialism, which is the usual belief system underlying atheism.

22
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:28,433
There are many kinds of atheism, but the common or garden atheists, the kind of Richard Dawkins type atheists, are usually mechanistic materialists.

23
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:40,900
What makes all religions different is the belief that there are forms of consciousness that are higher than or more inclusive than human consciousness, that our consciousness is not the only kind there is.

24
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:51,166
I mean, most materialists would admit that some animals are conscious too, but otherwise they see the entire universe as made up of unconscious matter.

25
00:02:51,200 --> 00:03:12,366
And then consciousness somehow emerges in a very mysterious way inside material brains when they get big enough, and the light bulb of consciousness goes on, but consciousness doesn't actually do anything, it doesn't give us free will, it's nothing but the activity of our brains.

26
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:21,133
That's the standard mechanistic materialist view, and of course when we die then the brain decays and all consciousness comes to an end.

27
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:33,366
That worldview leads to the idea that God, gods, spirits, angels, etc., are nothing but fantasies inside human minds and therefore inside human brains.

28
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:42,500
But this is just an assumption about the nature of consciousness, and in fact mechanistic materialism is extremely bad at explaining consciousness.

29
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:52,033
The very existence of consciousness is an embarrassment, which is why it's called the hard problem in the philosophy of mind.

30
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:56,833
So it's not as if mechanistic materialism has a brilliant theory of consciousness that explains it all.

31
00:03:56,866 --> 00:04:02,333
It doesn't have a theory at all, except to say it's nothing but brain activity.

32
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:11,833
On the other hand, when scientists actually look at the effects of religious and spiritual practices rather than approaching it in an ideological spirit,

33
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,900
then it turns out that religious and spiritual practices have measurable effects.

34
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:27,366
There have now been thousands of studies of the effects of spiritual and religious practices published in peer-reviewed journals.

35
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,933
Many of them are summarised in this The Handbook of Religion and Health in two thick volumes,

36
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:47,833
And basically, the result of this research shows that those who have spiritual and religious practices tend to be happier, healthier and live longer than those that don't.

37
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:58,700
In other words, it presumably means that those who don't have religious and spiritual practices are unhappy, unhappier, unhealthier and live shorter than those that do.

38
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:06,800
And what you would expect on this basis in a secular society, where many people have lost touch with traditional religions,

39
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:15,533
is that they on the whole get depressed, and of course depression is the endemic problem in industrial secular societies.

40
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,166
Millions and millions of people are on antidepressants.

41
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:29,333
So, presumably this lack of religious and spiritual practice is bad for health, and that's why I think

42
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:38,533
militant atheism should come with a health warning, because insofar as it puts people off their traditional religion and religious practices,

43
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:48,500
and leaves very little in their stead except a belief in science, then it's likely to harm people.

44
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,700
Spiritual practices are not going away.

45
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:58,733
On the contrary, they're increasing in their reach and in the number of people taking them up.

46
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,633
So for me the question is not about the value of spiritual practices,

47
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:11,366
the question is whether spiritual practices will reconnect with religious traditions from which they originally came,

48
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:20,000
whether religions will adopt more spiritual practices, because primarily it's about practice not about belief,

49
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:32,600
and or whether we'll have large numbers of people who are spiritual but not religious, whose practices float in a kind of secular void, unrooted in spiritual in religious traditions.

50
00:06:33,366 --> 00:06:39,633
Slavoj, is the persistence of religion a temporary phenomenon that will eventually be replaced by science?

51
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:46,100
I have here a rather paradoxical opinion.

52
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:48,300
No, it's not a temporary position.

53
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:54,066
I think it's in the, although I consider myself and eight days.

54
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,633
I think there is something in the structure of human life, human mind,

55
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,033
the way we relate to reality, and so on, that is to refer to your title, that opens up implies the void, which then is filled in by religion, but not to get lost in this.

56
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:24,033
I would just like to quickly describe a couple of points which complicate this simple opposition.

57
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:30,633
First, as you, Rupert, nicely deployed, yes, I would go even a step further.

58
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:45,233
The usual idea of materialism is small, somewhere in empty space there are just small bits of matter and they somehow how chaotically meets and everything comes out of that.

59
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:50,166
My type of materialism would have been, I called it that.

60
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:57,866
Materialism without matter, I take the lesson of, as far as I'm able to understand them, of quantum physics and so on.

61
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:10,533
And I claim we should not get fixed on a certain figure of matter, this mechanistic idea, you know, like little billiard balls, whatever, encountering each other.

62
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:14,466
Reality can be totally abstract.

63
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:17,600
It can be immaterial waves, whatever we call it.

64
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:21,033
What makes it eight days for me, and this is the crucial point,

65
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:32,133
is that it's not run by an overreaching intelligence or whatever, that it's basically blind.

66
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:37,600
A blind process, not mechanism, it's a blind process.

67
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:47,233
But for me, so-called reality, we can debate what it is, is, as I often develop, open ontologically non-constituted.

68
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:57,800
That's why I totally oppose those readings of quantum physics which see a kind of hidden idealism in it, you know, the whole of observation.

69
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,666
This means that reality somehow constituted through our gaze.

70
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:11,500
No, Niels Bohr, read him, was to the end not a religious guy.

71
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:16,500
But again, this idea of, I think changes enough

72
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:24,833
this idea of reality as ontologically incompleted with gaps even in itself, incomplete universe.

73
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:39,400
And at the same time, very important, the growing exploding gap between what science presents us as reality and our ordinary everyday experience of reality.

74
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,333
Look at classic Greek thought, Aristotle.

75
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,300
He basically constructs an ontology out of our ordinary daily experience of reality.

76
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:54,833
You know, heavy objects fall down, up, the sky and so on.

77
00:09:55,266 --> 00:10:02,833
But already with Galileo, this image becomes counterintuitive, then Einstein, then quantum physics.

78
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:06,266
Yes, it is, I will wrap up.

79
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,933
So that's the first thing.

80
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:14,366
So this is the problem that I shared even with some people like Hawking,

81
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:26,333
whose thesis is that the time of philosophy is over, science took, science is now replacing it.

82
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,600
Not only religion, but even philosophy.

83
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:35,766
Science is taking it over how it's true.

84
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:53,433
It's very interesting observation that in the last decade we were trained to even look for the solution of one's metaphysical question in science.

85
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,066
If you are today interested in our work finite or infinite,

86
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,800
We look into quantum cosmology, not to metaphysics.

87
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,133
If you want to know, we have a free will or not,

88
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,433
you ask cognitive scientists and so on and so on.

89
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,800
But I think, okay, I will explain it later to wrap up.

90
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,966
I think that there is a dimension of reflexive thinking,

91
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:25,100
which remains a domain of philosophy, I'm more of a philosopher here, in which for structural reasons cannot be covered up by science,

92
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:30,700
and point two on this, I would especially like to insist,

93
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,700
we should be very careful about what do we mean by belief.

94
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:42,800
Today, we have not only beliefs which we publicly profess, but secretly don't take seriously.

95
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:50,433
We also have things that we publicly mock, but we act as if we believe in them.

96
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:57,466
To conclude one line, literally, don't be mad at me, with my favorite, you must know it, most of you.

97
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:01,200
Jolt idea attributed to me is Bohr.

98
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:06,466
You know, a friend of him saw at the entrance to his house, a horse shoe.

99
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:11,233
Superstitious item preventing him from entering house.

100
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,833
And the friend asked him, okay, but you are an 8A scientist.

101
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,533
Why do you have that about the entrance to your house?

102
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,866
Bohr answered, I know, I don't believe in it.

103
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:25,366
I'm a scientist, but I was told it works even if you don't believe in it.

104
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:27,066
That's our attitude today.

105
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:28,833
I stop, I'm very sorry.

106
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,066
Thank you.

107
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,400
Thank you, Slavoj.

108
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,433
Jennifer, now your turn.

109
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:39,600
Is the persistence of religion a temporary phenomenon that will eventually be replaced by science?

110
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:49,700
So I'm not a philosopher, but I spend enough time with them to know that they have a pesky habit of asking you to define your terms before they're willing to engage,

111
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,300
usually, although we have two philosophers willing to have a conversation.

112
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:04,200
I mention this because there are two terms here, science and religion, which actually are pretty imprecise.

113
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:11,866
But here, I don't have to be a philosopher, I can be a historian and say that they're also historically contingent.

114
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:22,733
So the terms that I think we're going to be using today, although maybe my colleagues will surprise me, are terms that that actually really have a vintage from the 19th century.

115
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,000
And in the long span of human history, that means that they're pretty much, these terms are in their infancy.

116
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:42,366
I mentioned that just because it's important to know what we're talking about, where there's overlap, where there's porosity between what we're calling science, what we're calling religion.

117
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:46,066
It may do well to find other terms to have this conversation.

118
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:56,133
So for example, maybe idealism or rationalism versus empiricism might get us a little closer to whatever the epistemological or moral issues are at stake here.

119
00:13:56,666 --> 00:14:01,733
Okay, but these are the terms I'm given and I will be a good guest and work with them.

120
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:05,633
So will science replace religion?

121
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:13,600
Again, I'm a historian here and we're not really good at prognosticating, but if I look at history as any indicator, the answer is no.

122
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,066
And that is because if you look at, I think there are two ways to come at this.

123
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,166
One is from a scientific perspective and another one, a religious perspective.

124
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,433
So let's take a scientific perspective.

125
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,566
If you look at the long history of science, whether it's materialism, empiricism, naturalism, whatever ism, take your pick.

126
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:40,000
It's often historically been used to actually credentialize what we might call religious practices or religious belief.

127
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:48,700
That is to say, there's a long and vibrant history of showing how science has been used to show the efficacy of religion in one form or another.

128
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,400
If we take just the last hundred years, you can look at psychology, you can look at neuroscience,

129
00:14:57,933 --> 00:15:03,666
you can look at physics and see examples of this sort of dialectic and credentializing.

130
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:08,966
I'll just drop a few names here that might be interesting for the audience and hopefully familiar to some.

131
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:14,833
The first name that comes to mind is William James, the famous American pragmatist,

132
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:20,366
the first, one of the main figures who brings psychology to America.

133
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:25,333
And James was, as he called himself, a radical empiricist.

134
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:33,300
So he wanted to use science, but he wanted to use it as a way to, as he put it, widen the field for the search of God.

135
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:43,566
That is to say what James was seeking was a kind of rapprochement between these warring ways of knowing between science and religion.

136
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:51,033
And James is very important then in showing the efficacy of what he called religious experience.

137
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
Or you can even look at the 1970s.

138
00:15:54,166 --> 00:16:02,700
And I know Slavoj made a comment about, you know, not liking the sort of wooey idealism behind some quantum physics.

139
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:10,433
But that's just an example where some of the early figures in quantum physics of the, or at least in the 70s,

140
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:19,366
who helped to really bring it some prominence, were themselves deeply engaged in and influenced by Eastern mysticism.

141
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:26,633
And so in a sense, their engagement with Eastern mysticism gave them a new set of eyes to see the possibilities in quantum physics.

142
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:33,266
And in turn, they used quantum physics to show the efficacy of some of these Eastern philosophies.

143
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,933
Let me, if I may, just tuck in one more thing.

144
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,233
We can then come at it from, if you will, a religious perspective.

145
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,000
Again, take a historical perspective.

146
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,100
And what you see is that religion evolves.

147
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:47,800
Religion is very, very adaptable.

148
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,500
And by that, I mean all of the world's religions.

149
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:52,866
You can throw new facts at it.

150
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:53,800
You can throw science.

151
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,733
You can throw whatever.

152
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:07,500
And religious traditions have a positive genius for either somehow working with and lifting these new ideas and incorporating them into their worldview or just dodging them.

153
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,866
And this is, again, an insight that James had from his perspective on religion.

154
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He said, ultimately, human beings are pretty conservative.

155
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,466
They have a stock of beliefs.

156
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:27,000
And when a new idea comes, they try to get that new information to jibe with their belief.

157
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:35,800
And when it doesn't jibe, the conservative temperament, as he calls it, our passion on nature, wins out.

158
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:48,833
And so in that regard, there's a persistence with religion partly by way also of accommodation, evolution, and transvaluation of what comes its way.

159
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:56,233
So that is simply to say, though, again, I would never trust a historian to prognosticate.

160
00:17:56,633 --> 00:18:06,666
I think history tells us that we're not likely to see any time soon the usurping of one, the authority of one or the other.

161
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,500
Thank you, Jennifer.

162
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:14,466
Our first theme is, so, in 2002, Stephen Hawking's book,

163
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:24,133
The Theory of Everything, was published, the title suggesting that the scientific method is so powerful, but it has omniscient potential.

164
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:31,466
The first question of the debate is, can science, in principle, describe everything?

165
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:38,833
Slavoj, we'll start with you, and then this as a free for all people can jump in, have a free exchange.

166
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:41,800
Again, we have to be very specific.

167
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:45,833
Science, we mean the modern science.

168
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:55,133
First Galileo and so on, physics, that model, and then we know, sorry, what happened in the 20th century.

169
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,766
But then let's go to the end.

170
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,000
what interests me are those mixed phenomena.

171
00:19:05,766 --> 00:19:10,400
Like, did you hear about neuro-theology?

172
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:25,066
The idea which I think will ultimately fail to artificially through simple intervention into our brain or else generate religious experiences.

173
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:34,566
Of course, this is a limited procedure, but it nonetheless interests me what remains after this of traditional religion.

174
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:50,733
Second thing, precisely this plasticity, adaptability of religious experiences, how it can adapt, incorporate, neutral, and so on, is for me rather a sign of its insufficiency.

175
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,633
Like, sorry, but all religions cannot be true if you take them seriously.

176
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:10,600
And doesn't this adaptability rather not signal in the sense that there is some basic propensity towards religious experience?

177
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:11,600
I admit this.

178
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,966
It's very difficult to be a consequent atheist.

179
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:26,866
I would even go, that was the point of my Nisboar example, to say that most people, even atheists, at some practical level, they are religious.

180
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:32,900
religious, even Stalinism, not in the sense that Stalin was like God and so on.

181
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:42,066
But you know, when Stalinists speak about objective necessity, responsibility in the view of the laws of history and so on,

182
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:55,900
they presuppose a figure of the big other where, if I may be so, the ultimate meaning of everything we do will be finally recognized.

183
00:20:55,966 --> 00:21:06,933
So you presuppose a kind of divine perspective, the meaning of everything will be settled.

184
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:13,333
But you know, that's my paradoxical relationship towards religion, although I'm an atheist.

185
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:24,866
You know where for me religion is at its most interesting when precisely it tries to adapt to science but leads to apparently crazy results.

186
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,733
Probably most of you know this story, which is again absolutely my favorite one,

187
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:41,900
about how a friend of Darwin, some British bishop, whatever who was literal fundamentalist Christian believer had a problem.

188
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,133
He saw that Darwin is onto something clear, yes.

189
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:51,200
But the Bible tells him, he was literal here, that our universe was created a little bit over 4,000 years ago.

190
00:21:52,966 --> 00:22:00,366
So how to combine this with implications of Darwinism?

191
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:02,966
I hope you know what his solution was.

192
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,033
The best theory of ideology that I know.

193
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:13,466
His solution was that, of course, God cannot lie, he did create our world four thousand and something years ago,

194
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:24,166
but he directly created for himself like creating reality in a movie studio to give us a wrong impression of openness.

195
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:32,266
I think that is the best definition of ideology, this false openness creating a past.

196
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:36,100
Can science in principle describe everything.

197
00:22:40,366 --> 00:22:51,633
I think this is the standard, not religious but even modern European transcendental philosophical argument, it cannot

198
00:22:52,066 --> 00:23:02,133
because it lacks this philosophical reflectivity which shows you the conditions of your own scientific activity.

199
00:23:02,566 --> 00:23:12,166
I am not a Habermasian, but here Habermas made a good point where he said, yes, we can provide a perfect naturalist description of a human being.

200
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:21,566
But we are doing this as members of scientific community following a certain procedure, a certain understanding of being.

201
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:29,600
I agree with your group about mechanism materialism and this was not simply the result of studying reality.

202
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:40,733
it can be clearly showed that this mechanism aspect was an a priori that this materialist of the 18th century brought into reality.

203
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:55,200
So this type of reflection, which shows how scientific reasoning itself, it may try to explain everything, but in some sense it's unable to fully account for itself.

204
00:23:55,933 --> 00:24:05,333
Something, a certain scientific approach to reality so on, must already be here, and you always already presuppose it.

205
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:13,666
This circularity, I think, escapes science itself, at least in the sense of modern science.

206
00:24:14,966 --> 00:24:20,400
The limitations of materialism are fairly clear when it comes to consciousness,

207
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,800
but it's also run into great problems in cosmology and physics.

208
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:35,833
As most people know, Many cosmologists now think we live in a multiverse with billions, trillions of other unobserved universes, not a shred of evidence for them.

209
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:39,033
Ninety-five percent of reality is dark matter and dark energy.

210
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:40,566
We haven't got a clue what they are.

211
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:51,666
They've been invented to shore up the equations of physics so the cosmology works, but by titrating in as much dark matter as convenient to make the equations balance.

212
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:58,533
And superstring and M-theory with 10 and 11 dimensions untestable.

213
00:24:58,566 --> 00:25:04,733
They predict the existence of at least 10 to the 500 other realities or universes.

214
00:25:04,766 --> 00:25:09,433
So, physics is a mess and many people feel that theoretical physics is stuck.

215
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:12,133
I think it's stuck.

216
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:22,233
But, meanwhile, the problem of consciousness and consciousness studies is the most glaring limitation of materialist science,

217
00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:33,766
and I think that's what's so interesting is that in response to the hard problem, many philosophers of mind, even if they're atheists and materialists, are now becoming panpsychists.

218
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:41,200
There's been a panpsychist turn in philosophy saying there's some kind of consciousness even in atoms and molecules.

219
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,800
If you take that seriously, as I do myself, then you have to ask well what about the consciousness of the Sun?

220
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:53,266
I recently published a paper in the Journal of Consciousness Studies called Is the Sun Conscious?

221
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:58,900
I answer yes, probably, and what about the consciousness of the galaxy and the universe?

222
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:04,533
And if we get to the consciousness of the universe, then how does that differ from pantheism?

223
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:11,366
And if we get to pantheism, how's that very different from various forms of panentheisms?

224
00:26:11,366 --> 00:26:14,366
We get into a realm of theological discussion.

225
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:22,366
So I feel that materialist science is certainly very, very limited and its limitations are obvious.

226
00:26:22,366 --> 00:26:28,166
I think science is likely to expand to become much more pan-psychist

227
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:39,500
and I think there are other principles in science which are likely to be expanded including our view of the mind and allowing it to escape from the confines of the brain.

228
00:26:39,566 --> 00:26:42,833
So science can expand a lot further than it has done now.

229
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:57,433
It's held back by materialist dogma but even so I think it will still be incomplete because it will still presuppose ourselves, our minds, our own abilities to understand the universe which it won't explain

230
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:03,166
because the mind that's doing the understanding can't very easily explain itself since it's presupposed

231
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,200
and so I think there will always be limitations but I think right now it's more limited than it needs to be?

232
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:21,066
So I'll hop in here in response to the question whether science in principle could describe everything and maybe just add this.

233
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:25,133
I guess, well one is that it hasn't so far.

234
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:32,866
Most reputable scientists that I'm aware of, I mean this is the Dawkins quote actually sort of takes me by surprise, don't think that it can.

235
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,466
Have no expectation that anytime soon it will be able to.

236
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:44,833
But I think the maybe more pressing or, for me, more interesting question is, would we even want it to?

237
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:52,233
And here, I must say, I have a little anecdote from Richard Rorty, who's an American philosopher,

238
00:27:52,266 --> 00:28:01,066
who has this wonderful little scenario that he has in a piece that he wrote in the mid 80s called Science of Solidarity.

239
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:03,600
And he's been very cheeky, and I think quite funny.

240
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,033
And here he's talking about philosophers, but we could say the same thing about scientists.

241
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:09,600
So let me just do this Lordian move.

242
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:13,200
He invites us to imagine a scenario where the greatest scientists,

243
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:22,433
pardon me, all over the world are convened together to come up with the truth about the entirety of the world.

244
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:24,833
Yeah, they're going to describe everything.

245
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:30,266
And they have their many, maybe days long conversation, and then they all agree.

246
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:39,866
They can agree that values are objective, that science is rational, that truth corresponds to reality, and lo and behold, they can describe the whole universe for us.

247
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:45,100
And they're just going to put it together and hand it out, you know, pass it out in due course.

248
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:50,966
Rorty asked the question, would people say, you know, yay, we've been saved.

249
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,200
The scientists are going to answer everything for us.

250
00:28:53,766 --> 00:29:10,000
Or would we recoil in horror, not only at their hubris, but also at the utter absurdity of that claim and already proposes or supposes, as do I, that I think I would hope that many that 

251
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,233
those of us sitting around the Zoom room or listening in would be like the latter.

252
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:20,600
So why would that even be something desirable?

253
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,866
Because, again, science is something that human beings do.

254
00:29:23,866 --> 00:29:33,066
So what you're really saying is you're going to hand it over to a group of human beings to then adjudicate what the absolute truths of our world are.

255
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,733
And I think that would be boring at least and terrifying at worst.

256
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,966
So that's my thought on that question.

257
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,666
Okay, I'm gonna move us on to the next theme of the debate.

258
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:53,100
the next theme of the debate.

259
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:58,800
The next theme is why does religion remain so popular?

260
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:07,733
So Nietzsche declared the death of God 140 years ago, the majority of the world's population seems not to have gotten the memo.

261
00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:13,133
Jennifer, we will start with you again.

262
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:17,333
Why does religion remain so popular tonight?

263
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:21,266
Well, I'm glad you mentioned Nietzsche, because he's always on my mind.

264
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:24,333
He's never far away from my internal conversation.

265
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:28,433
So the memo that Nietzsche gave was, of course, the Madman parable.

266
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:32,366
And for those in the audience who don't know this, it's in 1882, the gay science,

267
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:39,200
Nietzsche introduces his famous Madman parable, where the madman comes running into the town square.

268
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:49,866
And he says, God is dead, God is dead, we have killed him, you and I, we have his blood bloodstains on our clothes, we have his bloodstains on our hands.

269
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,266
And he's greeted with indifference, snickering.

270
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,600
And he realizes that he's come too soon.

271
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,566
Yeah, his time has not yet come.

272
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:09,900
So when Nietzsche introduces the God, God is dead, his point in that, and it stays, it's something that develops even in his philosophy as he moves forward,

273
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:25,100
is that people will continue to pray to a god they don't believe in because they will cling to the moral certainties that religion provides, the existential consolations.

274
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:36,333
And so science is not going to just give a final blow to religion.

275
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:41,933
And I get, so anyways, if I may just follow up, I just think that the same is true, remains true today.

276
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:48,533
That we have all sorts of truths that want to undermine religious faith, but God is not yet dead.

277
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:51,733
As we can see with billions of people across the planet.

278
00:31:53,233 --> 00:32:02,533
And I think we'll still be quoting Nietzsche's parable for many, many decades to come.

279
00:32:03,366 --> 00:32:06,933
You know, another hypothesis that often intrigued me.

280
00:32:08,266 --> 00:32:14,700
Why do we always associate religion with being maybe happy?

281
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,400
Yes, but being good.

282
00:32:17,466 --> 00:32:30,533
I think a colleague of mine, okay, Slovenia is as president Trump, what you have put it as shit called over hundreds more, but sociologists made here something that the Catholic Church was horrified at.

283
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:42,800
He, on a quite representative sample, he tried to compare the, however it was able to be measured, family violence and so on,

284
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:51,300
the religious nature belief of people with the ethical standards they pursued in their lives.

285
00:32:52,033 --> 00:32:54,333
And his conclusion was anonymous.

286
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:01,133
On average, atheists are better morally than religious people.

287
00:33:01,633 --> 00:33:08,100
I'm not saying now I define myself also, some of you may know as Christian 80s and so on and so on,

288
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,633
but you know, if there is a lesson, especially from the past and so on,

289
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:19,166
is that God, God in the sense of when what motivates us,

290
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:30,866
when we refer to religion can also be easy in the sense of justifying even imposing evil acts and so on.

291
00:33:31,366 --> 00:33:38,266
Who is the cosmologist who wrote a book called, not Weinberger, who wrote the three first seconds?

292
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,566
I think he said something wonderful.

293
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:41,866
You will be shocked.

294
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:48,100
He said, without religion, good people would be good and bad people would be bad.

295
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:56,133
But you need something like religion to make basically good people do bad, horrible thing.

296
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:04,600
I'm not saying this is the ultimate truth of religion, but there also is an aspect of this.

297
00:34:04,933 --> 00:34:08,866
First, when we talk about meditation, Buddhism, and so on,

298
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:19,366
please don't forget that Buddha, the original guy, was, if not an atheist, at least an agnostic.

299
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,566
He explicitly says, God, blah, blah, it doesn't concern me, and so on.

300
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,266
Secondly, very quickly, my last point,

301
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:38,366
when we talk about, yes, effectiveness of religion and all that, but nonetheless, you know,

302
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:46,166
I agree with you, it cannot explain everything science and incidentally good scientists usually know this.

303
00:34:46,233 --> 00:34:52,000
You already indicated a key difference between true science and scientism.

304
00:34:52,133 --> 00:35:00,566
And I don't know if you agree or not, but I would have put somebody like Dawkins more on the side of scientism.

305
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:12,133
Like I spoke with many very serious cognitivists who told me he's more, as they put it in Nazi Germany, propaganda uptime, you know, for science.

306
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:13,400
He's not doing the real thing.

307
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:20,866
But nonetheless, look, my God, modern science did terrible, terribly important things.

308
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:37,300
So I nonetheless want to oppose to this new postmodern historicist way of, oh science is just another discourse, it has a notion of truth which is limited to it, and so on and so on.

309
00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:45,000
Okay Rupert, before you respond, I'd like you to bridge us into our next theme as well.

310
00:35:45,033 --> 00:35:54,966
So will the next generation be more or less religious than ourselves, just because we're running out of time.

311
00:35:54,966 --> 00:36:01,500
I think religions ultimately are based on direct experience, what you could call mystical experiences.

312
00:36:01,533 --> 00:36:10,733
Many people have them spontaneously in nature, some people have them through near-death experiences, some people have them through psychedelic experiences,

313
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:22,033
some people have them as a result of the deliberate practice of spiritual practices, like meditation, or prayer, or fasting, or other practices.

314
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:36,800
There are many spiritual practices, and this sense of the connection of our consciousness with a vastly greater consciousness is not a theory for people who've had this experience, it's an experience.

315
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:39,333
I've had such experiences myself.

316
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:49,933
I'm a practicing Christian, and one reason I am is that I've actually had direct experiences that make the idea of a consciousness beyond our own,

317
00:36:49,966 --> 00:36:58,666
not just a theory or proposition in theology, but an actual experience I've had, which for me was very convincing.

318
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:07,933
Now I know that atheists and materialists will say, well this is just the release of dopamine in the brain or something like that, or

319
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,533
circuiting various bits of the brain and that it's all inside the head.

320
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:19,933
But the fact is when you have these experiences you're working on the basis of experience.

321
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:23,166
I mean science is supposed to be empirical which means experience.

322
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:31,100
This is experience and to oppose it you don't oppose it with materialist science with experience you oppose it with ideology.

323
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,000
The ideology that mind is nothing but the brain.

324
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,333
Now, I think that the limitations of that ideology are very clear to anyone who's had mystical experiences,

325
00:37:42,366 --> 00:37:54,266
and increasing numbers of people are having them, partly because of the spread of psychedelics, which for many people are a kind of rite of passage into a larger view of consciousness.

326
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:59,966
They certainly were for me when I first took psychedelics in 1971 or something like that.

327
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,233
Before that I was an atheist, a standard materialist atheist.

328
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:17,666
It went with my scientific education and they helped open my mind to new possibilities and I later took up meditation and yoga because I wanted to explore the realm of consciousness without drugs.

329
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:26,400
I mean not against drugs but I'm not saying they're necessary but for many people they're an opening, an opening to this realm of experience.

330
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:35,866
Given that human beings have had these experiences over millennia, given that they underlie the enlightenment of the Buddha, it was a direct experience.

331
00:38:35,866 --> 00:38:46,400
Jesus' experience of his own closeness to God was not as a result of doing a PhD or going to a rabbinical seminary, it was a direct experience.

332
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,200
And these kinds of experiences are not going to go away, and

333
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:57,433
for those who've had them, they're extremely meaningful, they're more meaningful than reading books on popular science or

334
00:38:57,466 --> 00:39:04,566
people trying to explain away near-death experiences in terms of anoxia in the brain and that kind of thing.

335
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:15,833
And I think that they're likely therefore to lead to a persistent interest in spiritual practices and that these spiritual practices are likely to

336
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:27,166
lead to a resurgence of connection with religious traditions because if they're just free-floating, they're not rooted in a tradition and they're not rooted in a community.

337
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:39,533
And we religions provide many things for people, but they also they provide a sense of interconnection in community with other people in a way that fragmented individualism doesn't.

338
00:39:39,533 --> 00:39:45,533
So my own view is that it's very likely that religions will evolve, as Jennifer put.

339
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:49,100
I was wonderful the way she described this evolutionary process.

340
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,700
I think they'll continue to evolve.

341
00:39:50,733 --> 00:39:54,033
They are evolving before our very eyes at the moment,

342
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:58,966
and that many people will find them of value.

343
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:02,200
So that's my answer to the third question.

344
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:11,633
Sounds like Rupert was saying part of the enduring popularity of religion is due to the fact that we need something,

345
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:19,900
we need something more not to be fragmented individuals, and the question is does that thing need to be religion?

346
00:40:19,933 --> 00:40:25,566
Are are there other practices, other forms of life that could do that?

347
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:31,266
Or is there something specifically about religion that only religion can meet that need?

348
00:40:31,366 --> 00:40:33,133
And then the question is what counts as religion?

349
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,666
So, sorry to introduce a lot of questions there,

350
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,800
but maybe that'll help fuel the remaining part of this debate before we get to the Q&A.

351
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:46,733
I think what I would say is I think I definitely heard in Rupert and I'm pretty sure I heard in Slavoj say,

352
00:40:47,933 --> 00:41:00,066
I don't want to put words in your mouth, but something to the extent that the longing for or the drive towards religious experience is from their view, something that is deeply human.

353
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:07,800
And I would just say, unfortunately, in this regard, this debate's gonna be very boring because I will not disagree with them.

354
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:13,766
That's the point that I would make that, and it's called many, many different things.

355
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:17,033
Jung called it the religious instinct.

356
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:23,066
Victor Frankl called it man's search for meaning.

357
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,233
Ralph Waldo Emerson called it beautiful necessity.

358
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:27,433
We could go on and on.

359
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:38,700
But this craving for something that I do think is peculiar to something that we might call religion, and it goes beyond theology.

360
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:43,033
It goes beyond epistemology or truth claims.

361
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:46,733
And this is to pick up on Rupert.

362
00:41:46,766 --> 00:41:48,200
It goes beyond institutions.

363
00:41:48,233 --> 00:41:57,100
It goes to the question of certain kinds of experiences, feelings, environments, mystical experiences, a sense of wonder and awe.

364
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:02,733
And I think that this is something that we see time and time again,

365
00:42:03,233 --> 00:42:12,100
that no matter how much materialism wants to explain it away, or at least it does explain it, it, but that it's there.

366
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,066
What form will that take?

367
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,733
We'll have to see.

368
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:26,700
I think what we do know about this next generation is that many, at least the educated ones, are keenly aware of living in something that we call the Anthropocene.

369
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,500
They also know that they've inherited from their parents and their grandparents that they're living on borrowed time.

370
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:39,433
And so I think all of these questions are going to take a particular kind of urgency now for the next generation.

371
00:42:40,466 --> 00:42:50,766
And I don't think either something we call science or religion is going to be enough for them to, as Nietzsche put it, shoot arrows of longing over this abyss.

372
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,933
I think they're going to borrow from both.

373
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:02,566
But I think that yearning, that longing, that something that Jung calls a religious instinct is something that is absolutely deeply human.

374
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,900
And it may take different forms, but I don't think it's going to go away.

375
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:10,600
And that's, that's, Slavoj, I hand it over to you now.

376
00:43:11,433 --> 00:43:14,266
Okay, but you can take it from me when you want, okay.

377
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:28,466
Very briefly, first, my reply to that idea that religions are based on an extra intense deep, no irony intended here, direct experience.

378
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:31,100
But correct me if I'm wrong.

379
00:43:31,733 --> 00:43:34,800
I read some texts by, as already mentioned,

380
00:43:35,266 --> 00:43:44,300
I think by so-called neuro-theologists who claim that, and I read then theologist's responses to them.

381
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:49,966
Neuro-theologists claim that by doing, don't ask me what, certain things to your brain,

382
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:59,400
they can trigger something that you experience precisely as this intense religious experience.

383
00:43:59,866 --> 00:44:03,366
And it's interesting, what is the theologist's answer to them?

384
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:09,766
because here it seems like a good proof, you know, nothing to do with your inner life.

385
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,300
I do it to you in a certain way and you will have that type of experience.

386
00:44:15,433 --> 00:44:24,466
But all the experiences that you, and I loved your presentations, Rupert, that you mentioned, you know, like Buddha's enlightenment,

387
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:33,933
where I'm sorry, Buddha's enlightenment for original Buddhism itself was not in any sense a religious experience.

388
00:44:34,233 --> 00:44:40,666
It was simply an experience of true nature, of reality, of the ultimate void, and so on and so on.

389
00:44:41,133 --> 00:44:42,433
Christian experience.

390
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:50,333
My God, I'm fascinated by it, but for me, and I agree here with ultra-theologists like my beloved 20th century,

391
00:44:50,866 --> 00:45:01,533
Gilbert Keith Chesterton, Christ's basic experience is that, Father, Father, why have you abandoned me? which is precisely an incredible,

392
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:07,833
intense experience of the separation from God, which is the way I see it unique.

393
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,666
I can argue about this later, unique for Christianity.

394
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:26,566
So I would nonetheless go a little bit further in this direction that our religious experience, no matter how intensely personal it is, it's historically formed.

395
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,333
I can go on, for example, how do you call it?

396
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:39,366
John of the cross and Teresa of the two big medieval mystics they are describing a very different, a very different experience.

397
00:45:39,433 --> 00:45:42,666
So I would go more in this direction and just to finish.

398
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:53,533
Yes, the limit of science is a certain of this, this experience of even what I call incompleteness of reality.

399
00:45:54,133 --> 00:45:59,966
But you see, my point is not then materials come and accounts for it.

400
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:09,900
I think that this shattering experience of let's call it primordial void, what Buddha experienced, this is for me, the zero level of materialism.

401
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:15,266
This, you want materialism, don't look to mechanistic scientists, look to Buddha.

402
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,966
Hey, thank you Slavoj, thanks to all of you.

403
00:46:21,033 --> 00:46:22,400
Thanks Rupert, thanks Jennifer.

404
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:23,633
Thank you.

405
00:46:24,133 --> 00:46:25,066
Thank you very much.

406
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:25,866
Thank you.

407
00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:01,066
大家好

408
00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:03,200
欢迎来到虚无中的幻想

409
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:07,366
我是Wes Alwan （一个）半途而废的生活哲学播客的联合主持人

410
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,366
在对学术哲学家的调查中 85%的人自认为是无神论者

411
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,533
在欧洲 现存的宗教已经衰退了一个世纪

412
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,133
即使在美国 参与率也在下降

413
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:27,133
然而 在全球范围内 宗教仍是一种强大的力量 对其消亡的预测并未实现

414
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:35,266
在那些放弃现存宗教的人中 正如正念和瑜伽这样的新形式的灵性 正在兴起

415
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:44,533
宗教是否以其众多形式为人类提供了一种心理支持 使其成为必不可少的 没有它就只有虚无

416
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,866
是否有关于存在的某些事物是无法言喻的 且永远不能被消灭

417
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:58,166
或者宗教的持续存在是一种长期但最终是暂时的现象 将被科学的成功所取代

418
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:07,700
今天我们请到了Rupert Sheldrake 他是一位科学家、作者和心灵研究者 以他2012年的书籍

419
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,033
《科学的迷思》以及他后来被TED禁止的备受争议的TED演讲而最为人知

420
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:26,200
Slavoj Zizek是黑格尔式的精神分析师 可以说是我们时代最著名的名人哲学家 独特且极具争议

421
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,733
Sahoui目前担任伯班克人文学院国际主任

422
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:44,500
而Jennifer Ratner Rosenhagen是威斯康星大学麦迪逊分校的历史学教授 以她关于尼采和跨大西洋知识流动的研究而知名

423
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,900
她的书包括《美国尼采》和《塑造美国的思想》 该书首次发表于2019年

424
00:01:49,900 --> 00:02:00,033
我们将开始提出一个问题 每位发言人有三分钟时间来陈述他们的想法 然后我们进入辩论的主体部分

425
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:08,833
那个问题是 宗教的持续存在是否只是一种暂时现象 最终会被科学所取代

426
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,200
好的 我们先从Rupert开始

427
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:19,500
那么 宗教与机械唯物主义（通常是无神论背后的信仰体系）有什么不同

428
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:28,433
有很多种无神论 但普通的无神论者 像理查德·道金斯那种类型的无神论者 通常是机械唯物主义者

429
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:40,900
与之不同的是 所有宗教都相信存在着比人类意识更高级或更包容的意识形态 我们的意识不是唯一的

430
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:51,166
我是说 大多数唯物主义者会承认一些动物也是有意识的 但除此之外他们认为整个宇宙由无意识的物质构成

431
00:02:51,200 --> 00:03:12,366
然后 意识以一种非常神秘的方式在物质大脑内部出现 当它们足够大时 意识的灯泡就会亮起 但意识实际上并不做任何事情 它不赋予我们自由意志 它只不过是我们大脑活动的产物

432
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:21,133
这就是标准的机械唯物主义观点 当然当我们死亡时 大脑会腐烂 所有意识都会终结

433
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:33,366
这种世界观导致了这样一种观点：上帝、神灵、精神、天使等 不过是人类头脑中的幻想 因此存在于人类的大脑中

434
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:42,500
但这只是关于意识本质的一个假设 实际上 机械唯物主义在解释意识方面表现得极其糟糕

435
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:52,033
意识的存在本身就是一个尴尬的问题 这就是为什么它被称为心灵哲学中的“难题”

436
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:56,833
因此 机械唯物主义并没有一个出色的意识理论可以解释这一切

437
00:03:56,866 --> 00:04:02,333
除了说这只不过是大脑活动意外 它根本没有理论

438
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:11,833
另一方面 当科学家真正关注宗教和精神实践的影响而不是从意识形态的角度来研究它时

439
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,900
结果表明 宗教和灵性实践有可衡量的效果

440
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:27,366
现在已经有成千上万项关于灵性和宗教实践效果的研究发表在同行评审期刊上

441
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,933
其中许多研究在这两卷厚厚的《宗教与健康手册》中被总结

442
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:47,833
基本上 这项研究的结果显示 那些有灵性和宗教实践的人往往比那些没有的人更快乐、更健康并且寿命更长

443
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:58,700
换句话说 这大概意味着那些没有宗教和灵性实践的人不快乐、更不健康并且寿命更短

444
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:06,800
在这基础上 你可以预期到 在一个许多人失去了传统宗教联系的世俗社会中

445
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:15,533
他们总的来说会感到沮丧 当然 抑郁是工业化世俗社会的普遍问题

446
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,166
数以百万计的人在服用抗抑郁药

447
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:29,333
因此 可以推测缺乏宗教和灵性实践对健康不利 这就是为什么我认为

448
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:38,533
激进的无神论应该被标注着健康警告 因为它使人们远离传统宗教和宗教习俗

449
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:48,500
除了对科学的信仰之外 几乎没有什么可以代替他们 那么它很可能会伤害人们

450
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,700
灵性实践不会消失

451
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:58,733
相反 它们的影响范围和采用它们的人数在增加

452
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,633
所以对我来说 问题不在于灵性实践的价值

453
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:11,366
问题在于灵性实践是否会重新连接到它们的宗教传统来源

454
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:20,000
宗教是否会采纳更多的灵性实践 因为这主要是关于实践而不是信仰

455
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:32,600
或者我们是否会有大量有精神信仰但不信教的人 他们的实践在一种世俗的虚空中漂浮 没有植根于宗教传统

456
00:06:33,366 --> 00:06:39,633
Slavoj 宗教的持续存在是一个最终会被科学取代的暂时现象吗

457
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:46,100
我在这里有一个相当矛盾的观点

458
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:48,300
不 这不是一个暂时的立场

459
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:54,066
我认为它... 虽然我认为自己是无神论者

460
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,633
我认为在人类生活、人类心智的结构中

461
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,033
我们与现实的关系等方面 正如你的标题所指 这个开放性意味着虚空 它们随后被宗教填充 但不要迷失在这中间

462
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:24,033
我只想快速描述几个点 这些点使这种简单的对立变得复杂

463
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:30,633
首先 正如你 鲁珀特 巧妙地展开的 是的 我甚至会更进一步

464
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:45,233
通常的唯物主义观念是微小 在空旷的空间中只有小块的物质 它们以某种方式混乱地相遇 一切都由此产生

465
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:50,166
我的唯物主义类型会是 我称之为

466
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:57,866
没有物质的唯物主义 我从量子物理等方面吸取教训 尽我所能理解

467
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:10,533
我声称我们不应该固定在某种物质的形态上 这种机械的想法 你知道 像小的台球 无论如何 它们相互碰撞

468
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:14,466
现实可以是完全抽象的

469
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:17,600
它可以是无形的波动 无论我们称之为什么

470
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:21,033
对我来说 这让我成为无神论者 这是关键点

471
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:32,133
就是它不是由一个超凡的智慧或其他什么来运行的 它基本上是盲目的

472
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:37,600
一个盲目的过程 不是机制 它是一个盲目的过程

473
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:47,233
但对我来说 所谓的现实 我们可以讨论它是什么 是--正如我常说的--本体论上未构成的开放

474
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:57,800
这就是为什么我完全反对那些将量子物理学视为一种隐藏的理想主义的解读

475
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,666
好像整个过程意味着现实以某种方式通过我们的凝视而构成

476
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:11,500
不 读读尼尔斯·玻尔 他到最后都不是一个宗教人士

477
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:16,500
但我认为 这种想法足以改变这种现实的想法

478
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:24,833
即现实在本体论上是不完整的 甚至在其本身内也存在间隙 （是）不完整的宇宙

479
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:39,400
同时 非常重要的是 科学呈现给我们的现实与我们日常经验中的现实之间不断扩大的鸿沟

480
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,333
看看古希腊的思想 亚里士多德

481
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,300
他基本上是从我们日常的现实经验中构建了一个本体论

482
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:54,833
你知道 重物下落 上升 天空等等

483
00:09:55,266 --> 00:10:02,833
但是早在伽利略时代 这个图景就变得违反直觉 然后是爱因斯坦 然后是量子物理

484
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:06,266
是的 我将总结

485
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,933
所以这是第一点

486
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:14,366
所以这就是我甚至与像霍金这样的人共有的问题

487
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:26,333
他的论点是哲学的时代已经结束 科学取而代之 现在正在取代它

488
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,600
不仅是宗教 甚至是哲学

489
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:35,766
科学正在接管它 这是真的

490
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:53,433
这是非常有趣的观察 在过去的十年中 我们甚至接受了在科学中寻找形而上学问题的解决方案的训练

491
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,066
如果你今天对我们的世界是有限还是无限的感兴趣

492
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,800
我们看量子宇宙学 而不是形而上学

493
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,133
如果你想知道我们是否有自由意志

494
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,433
你问认知科学家

495
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,800
但我认为 好吧 稍后我会解释以总结

496
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,966
我认为存在一种反思性思考的维度

497
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:25,100
这仍然是哲学的领域 我在这里更多是作为一个哲学家 出于结构性原因 科学无法覆盖

498
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:30,700
对此 我特别想强调第二点

499
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,700
我们应该非常小心我们所指的信仰是什么意思

500
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:42,800
今天 我们不仅有那些我们公开宣称但私下不认真对待的信仰

501
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:50,433
我们还有那些我们公开嘲笑 但行为上却表现得好像我们相信它们的事情

502
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:57,466
总结一句话 字面上的 不要生我的气 用我最喜欢的 你们大多数人应该知道的

503
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:01,200
尼尔斯·玻尔的例子

504
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:06,466
你知道 他的一个朋友在他家的入口处看到了一个马蹄铁

505
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:11,233
一个迷信物品 阻止鬼进入房子

506
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,833
朋友问他 好吧 但你是一名科学家

507
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,533
为什么你的房子入口处会有那个

508
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,866
玻尔回答说 我知道 我不相信它

509
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:25,366
我是科学家 但我被告知即使你不相信它 它也有效

510
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:27,066
这就是我们今天的态度

511
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:28,833
我说完了 非常抱歉

512
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,066
谢谢

513
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,400
谢谢 斯拉沃热

514
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,433
珍妮弗 轮到你了

515
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:39,600
宗教的持续存在是一个最终会被科学取代的暂时现象吗

516
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:49,700
我不是哲学家 但我与他们共事了很久 足以知道他们有一个让人烦恼的习惯 在他们愿意参与之前 你要定义你的术语

517
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,300
虽然我们有两位哲学家已经愿意进行对话

518
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:04,200
但我之所以提这个 是因为这里有两个术语 科学和宗教 实际上相当不精确

519
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:11,866
但在这里 我不必是哲学家 我可以是历史学家 并说他们也是历史上的偶然产物

520
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:22,733
所以我认为我们今天将要使用的术语 虽然也许我的同事会让我惊讶 但实际上是来自 19 世纪的术语

521
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,000
在人类历史的漫长时期中 这意味着这些术语实际上还处于婴儿期

522
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:42,366
我之所以提及这点 是因为重要的是要知道我们在讨论什么 我们所说的科学和我们所说的宗教之间 哪些地方是重叠的 哪些地方是有间隙的

523
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:46,066
最好找到其他术语来进行此对话

524
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:56,133
例如 也许唯心主义或理性主义与经验主义的比较 可能会让我们更接近这里所涉及的认识论或道德问题

525
00:13:56,666 --> 00:14:01,733
但好吧 我被给到的术语就是这些（科学和宗教） 我将成为一个好客人 探讨它们

526
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:05,633
那么 科学会取代宗教吗

527
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:13,600
再次 我在这里是作为一名历史学家 我们并不很擅长预测 但如果我把历史作为指标 答案是不会

528
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,066
这是因为 我认为有两种方法来看待这个问题

529
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,166
一种是从科学的角度 另一种是从宗教的角度

530
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,433
那么 我们来看看科学的角度

531
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,566
如果你观察科学的悠久历史 无论是唯物主义、经验主义、自然主义 不管是什么主义 随你挑选

532
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:40,000
实际上 它通常在历史上被用来给我们可能称之为宗教实践或宗教信仰的东西授权

533
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:48,700
也就是说 有一个漫长而充满活力的历史 展示了科学是如何被用来以某种形式展示宗教的有效性的

534
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,400
如果我们只看最近一百年 你可以看看心理学 你可以看看神经科学

535
00:14:57,933 --> 00:15:03,666
你可以看看物理学 并看到这种辩证和授权的例子

536
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:08,966
我在这里会简单提一些可能对听众有趣并且对一些人来说可能熟悉的名字

537
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:14,833
首先想到的名字是威廉·詹姆斯 著名的美国实用主义者

538
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:20,366
是将心理学引入美国的主要人物之一

539
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:25,333
詹姆斯自称为激进的经验主义者

540
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:33,300
因此 他想要使用科学 正如他所说 他想用科学来拓宽探索上帝的领域

541
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:43,566
也就是说 詹姆斯所追求的是在这些相互冲突的认知方式之间 即科学与宗教之间 找到某种和解

542
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:51,033
在展示他所谓的宗教体验的有效性方面 詹姆斯非常重要

543
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
或者你甚至可以看看1970年代

544
00:15:54,166 --> 00:16:02,700
我知道斯拉沃热提到了 你知道 不喜欢一些量子物理背后的那种神秘主义、理想主义

545
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:10,433
但这只是一个例子 一些早期的量子物理学者 至少是在70年代

546
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:19,366
他们帮助量子物理学获得了一定的知名度 自己深深地参与并受到东方神秘主义的影响

547
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:26,633
因此 在某种意义上 他们与东方神秘主义的接触为他们提供了一套新的眼睛 以看到量子物理学的可能性

548
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:33,266
反过来 他们使用量子物理学来展示一些这些东方哲学的有效性

549
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,933
如果可以的话 让我再补充一点

550
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,233
我们可以从宗教的角度来看这个问题

551
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,000
再次 采取历史的视角

552
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,100
你会看到宗教在进化

553
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:47,800
宗教的适应性非常非常强

554
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,500
我的意思是所有的世界性的宗教

555
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:52,866
你可以抛给它新的事实

556
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:53,800
你可以抛给它科学

557
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,733
你可以抛任何东西

558
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:07,500
宗教传统有一种独特的才能 要么以某种方式与这些新思想共处并将它们纳入其世界观 要么就是回避它们

559
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,866
这再次是詹姆斯从他对宗教的视角中得到的洞察

560
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
他说 归根结底 人类是相当保守的

561
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,466
他们有一套信仰体系

562
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:27,000
当新观点出现时 他们尝试让这些新信息与他们的信仰协调

563
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:35,800
当情况不合时 他所说的保守气质 我们的天性就会占上风

564
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:48,833
因此 在这方面 宗教的持续存在部分原因 也在于适应、进化和对其遇到的事物的价值转换

565
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:56,233
所以这只是说 尽管如此 再次强调 我永远不会相信历史学家的预测

566
00:17:56,633 --> 00:18:06,666
我认为历史告诉我们 我们不太可能很快看到一个领域取代另一个领域的权威

567
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,500
谢谢你 珍妮弗

568
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:14,466
我们的第一个主题是 所以 在2002年 史蒂芬·霍金的书

569
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:24,133
《万物理论》被出版 标题暗示着科学方法非常强大 它有全知的潜力

570
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:31,466
辩论的第一个问题是 原则上 科学能描述一切吗

571
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:38,833
斯拉沃热 我们从你开始 然后这是一个自由参与的环节 人们可以随意加入 自由交流

572
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:41,800
再次 我们必须非常具体

573
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:45,833
我们说的科学 是指现代科学

574
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:55,133
首先是伽利略等人的物理学模型 然后我们知道 抱歉 20世纪发生了一些事情

575
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,766
但让我们直抵终点

576
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,000
我感兴趣的是那些混合现象

577
00:19:05,766 --> 00:19:10,400
比如 你听说过神经神学吗

578
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:25,066
这个想法 我认为最终会失败 试图通过简单干预我们的大脑或其他方式人为地产生宗教体验

579
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:34,566
当然 这是一个有限的过程 但它仍然让我感兴趣 传统宗教在此之后还剩下什么

580
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:50,733
第二 正是宗教体验的这种可塑性、适应性 它如何适应、整合、中和等等 对我来说更像是它的不足之处的标志

581
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,633
就像 抱歉 但如果你认真对待它们 不可能所有宗教都是真实的

582
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:10,600
从某种意义上说 这种适应性难道不是表明宗教体验存在某种基本倾向吗

583
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:11,600
我承认这一点

584
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,966
成为一个连贯的无神论者是非常困难的

585
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:26,866
我甚至会说 这是我的波尔例子的要点 大多数人 即使是无神论者 在某种实际层面上 他们是有宗教信仰的

586
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:32,900
甚至斯大林主义 不是说斯大林就像上帝那样

587
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:42,066
但你知道 当斯大林主义者谈论客观必然性、在历史规律视角下的责任等时

588
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:55,900
他们预设了一个大他者的形象 如果我可以这么说 我们所做的一切最终的意义将被认可

589
00:20:55,966 --> 00:21:06,933
所以你预设了一种神圣的视角 一切的意义将被解决

590
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:13,333
但你知道 这是我对宗教的矛盾关系 尽管我是一个无神论者

591
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:24,866
对我来说 当宗教试图适应科学但却导致明显疯狂的结果时 它是最有趣的

592
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,733
可能你们大多数人知道这个故事 这又是我最喜欢的一个

593
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:41,900
关于达尔文的一个朋友 某位英国主教 不管是谁 他是字面意义上的基督教原教旨主义者 遇到了一个问题

594
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,133
他看到达尔文明确地发现了一些东西 是的

595
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:51,200
但圣经告诉他 他在这里是字面意义上的 我们的宇宙是在大约4000年前被创造的

596
00:21:52,966 --> 00:22:00,366
那么如何将这个与达尔文主义的含义相结合呢

597
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:02,966
我希望你知道他的解决方案是什么

598
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,033
这我所知道的最好的意识形态理论

599
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:13,466
他的解决方案是 当然 上帝不会撒谎 他确实在四千多年前创造了我们的世界

600
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:24,166
但他直接为自己创造 就像在电影制片厂里创造现实一样 给我们一种错误的开放性印象

601
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:32,266
我认为这是意识形态的最佳定义 这种虚假的开放性创造了过去

602
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:36,100
科学能在原则上描述这一切吗

603
00:22:40,366 --> 00:22:51,633
我认为这就是标准 不是宗教的而是现代欧洲先验哲学的论证 它不能

604
00:22:52,066 --> 00:23:02,133
因为它缺乏这种哲学反思性 无法向你展示你自己的科学活动的条件

605
00:23:02,566 --> 00:23:12,166
我不是哈贝马斯主义者 但在这里哈贝马斯提出了一个很好的观点 他说 是的 我们可以对人类提供完美的自然主义描述

606
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:21,566
但我们这样做的时候 是作为科学界的成员 是按照一定的程序、对存在的一定理解来这样做的

607
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:29,600
我同意你们小组关于机械唯物主义的看法 这并不仅仅是研究现实的结果

608
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:40,733
可以清楚地显示 这种机械观点是18世纪的唯物主义者带入现实的一个先验观点

609
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:55,200
所以 这种反思 它展示了科学推理本身 它可能试图解释一切 但在某种意义上它无法完全解释自身

610
00:23:55,933 --> 00:24:05,333
有些东西 某种对现实的科学方法等等 它一定已经存在了 （因为）你总是已经预设了它

611
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:13,666
我认为这种循环性 至少在现代科学的意义上 是科学本身无法逃避的

612
00:24:14,966 --> 00:24:20,400
当涉及到意识时 唯物主义的局限性相当明显

613
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,800
但它在宇宙学和物理学中也遇到了巨大的问题

614
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:35,833
如大多数人所知 许多宇宙学家现在认为我们生活在一个多元宇宙中 有数十亿、数万亿的其他未被观察到的宇宙 对它们没有一点证据

615
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:39,033
现实的95%是暗物质和暗能量

616
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:40,566
我们对它们一无所知

617
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:51,666
这些概念之所以被发明出来 是为了支撑物理学的方程式 让宇宙学能正常进行 通过适当增加暗物质来使方程式平衡

618
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:58,533
还有超弦和M理论 有10和11个维度 是无法测试的

619
00:24:58,566 --> 00:25:04,733
它们预测至少存在10的500次方个其他现实或宇宙

620
00:25:04,766 --> 00:25:09,433
所以 物理学一团糟 很多人觉得理论物理学陷入了困境

621
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:12,133
我认为它陷入了困境

622
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:22,233
但与此同时 意识问题和意识研究是唯物主义科学最明显的局限

623
00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:33,766
我认为这正是有趣之处 在回应“难题”时 许多心灵哲学家 即使他们是无神论者和唯物主义者 现在也变成了泛心论者

624
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:41,200
哲学中出现了一个泛心论的转向 认为即使是原子和分子中也存在某种形式的意识

625
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,800
如果你像我一样认真对待这一点 那么你必须问 太阳的意识是什么呢

626
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:53,266
我最近在《意识研究杂志》上发表了一篇论文 题为《太阳有意识吗 》

627
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:58,900
我的回答是 可能有 那么银河系和宇宙的意识又如何呢

628
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:04,533
如果我们讨论到宇宙的意识 那么这与泛神论有何不同呢

629
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:11,366
如果我们谈到泛神论 它与各种形式的泛神论有何不同

630
00:26:11,366 --> 00:26:14,366
我们进入了一个神学讨论的领域

631
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:22,366
因此 我觉得唯物主义科学显然是非常非常有限的 其局限是显而易见的

632
00:26:22,366 --> 00:26:28,166
我认为科学可能会扩展 变得更加泛心论

633
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:39,500
我认为科学中还有其他原则可能会被扩展 包括我们对心灵的看法 允许它从大脑的局限中逃脱

634
00:26:39,566 --> 00:26:42,833
所以科学可以比现在扩展得多得多

635
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:57,433
它被唯物主义教条所阻碍 但即便如此 我认为它仍然是不完整的 因为它仍然会预设我们自己、我们的心灵、我们自己理解宇宙的能力 它不会解释

636
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:03,166
因为进行理解的心灵无法很容易地解释自己 因为它是被预设的

637
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,200
因此 我认为总会有局限性 但我认为相比于我们所需的它 现在的它更有局限性

638
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:21,066
因此 我在此回应科学原则上是否能描述一切的问题 并做一些补充

639
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:25,133
我猜 首先是到目前为止它还没有

640
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:32,866
我所知道的大多数有声望的科学家 我的意思是道金斯的引述实际上让我感到惊讶 但我不认为它可以

641
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,466
也无法预期它在不久的将来能够做到

642
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:44,833
但我认为或许更迫切 或对我来说 更有趣的问题是 甚至说我们是否希望它能做到吗

643
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:52,233
在这里 我必须说 我有一个来自理查德·罗尔提的小故事 他是一位美国哲学家

644
00:27:52,266 --> 00:28:01,066
他在80年代中期写的一篇文章《科学与团结》中有一个精彩的小场景

645
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:03,600
他非常俏皮 我认为相当有趣

646
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,033
在这里他讨论的是哲学家 但我们可以对科学家说同样的话

647
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:09,600
所以让我做这个罗尔提式的举动

648
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:13,200
他邀请我们想象一个场景 科学家们

649
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:22,433
抱歉 全世界的最好的科学家聚集在一起 来揭示整个世界的真相

650
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:24,833
是的 他们将描述一切

651
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:30,266
并且他们有许多天的长谈 然后他们都同意了

652
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:39,866
他们可以同意价值是客观的 科学是理性的 真理与现实相符 而且瞧 他们能为我们描述整个宇宙

653
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:45,100
他们只是要整合起来 然后分发出去 你知道 适时传递

654
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:50,966
罗尔提问道 人们会说 你知道 耶 我们得救了

655
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,200
科学家会为我们回答一切

656
00:28:53,766 --> 00:29:10,000
或者我们会因为他们的傲慢而感到恐惧 不仅仅是因为傲慢本身 还因为那种说法的彻底荒谬 正如我所提出或所假设的

657
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,233
我认为我们中许多人 无论是坐在Zoom房间里的还是在听的人 都会像后者一样反应

658
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:20,600
那么 为什么那甚至会是一件值得渴望的事情呢

659
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,866
因为 再次强调 科学是人类所做的事情

660
00:29:23,866 --> 00:29:33,066
所以你真正说的是 你将把它交给一群人类 然后由他们来裁定我们世界的绝对真理

661
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,733
我认为那至少会很无聊 最糟的情况可能会令人恐惧

662
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,966
那是我对那个问题的想法

663
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,666
好的 我将我们引向辩论的下一个主题

664
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:53,100
辩论的下一个主题

665
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:58,800
下一个主题是为什么宗教仍然如此流行

666
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:07,733
尼采在140年前宣布上帝之死 （但现在）世界上的大多数人似乎还没有得到这个通知

667
00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:13,133
珍妮弗 我们将再次从你开始

668
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:17,333
为什么在当代 宗教仍然如此流行

669
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:21,266
嗯 我很高兴你提到了尼采 因为他总会出现在我的脑海中

670
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:24,333
他从未远离我的内心对话

671
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:28,433
尼采给出的“备忘录” 当然是疯子的寓言

672
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:32,366
对于那些不知道这个的观众 这是在1882年 《快乐的科学》中

673
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:39,200
尼采介绍了他著名的疯子寓言 疯子跑进市集中央

674
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:49,866
他说 上帝已死 上帝已死 是我们杀了他 你和我 我们的衣服上有他的血迹 我们的手上有他的血迹

675
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,266
他被以冷漠、窃笑迎接

676
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,600
他意识到他来得太早了

677
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,566
是的 他的时代还未到来

678
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:09,900
所以当尼采介绍上帝已死 他的观点在于--这是一个即使在他后来的哲学中仍在发展的观点--

679
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:25,100
人们将继续向他们不相信的神祈祷 因为他们会坚持宗教提供的道德确信 存在的安慰

680
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:36,333
因此 科学不会给宗教以最终一击

681
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:41,933
我想说 无论如何 如果我可以继续说 我认为现在仍然如此

682
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:48,533
我们有各种真理想要削弱宗教信仰 但上帝还未死

683
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:51,733
正如我们可以看到的 地球上有数十亿人

684
00:31:53,233 --> 00:32:02,533
我认为我们将在未来几十年中继续引用尼采的寓言

685
00:32:03,366 --> 00:32:06,933
你知道 另一个经常让我感兴趣的假设

686
00:32:08,266 --> 00:32:14,700
为什么我们总是将宗教与幸福联系在一起

687
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,400
是的 成为“善”

688
00:32:17,466 --> 00:32:30,533
我认为我的一个同事 好吧 斯洛文尼亚 正如特朗普总统所说 把它描述为一地鸡毛 但社会学家在这里发现了一些天主教会感到震惊的事情

689
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:42,800
他在一个相当有代表性的样本上尝试比较了--不管他是如何测量的--家庭暴力等问题...

690
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:51,300
人们的宗教性信仰与他们在生活中追求的道德标准

691
00:32:52,033 --> 00:32:54,333
他的结论是一致的

692
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:01,133
平均而言 无神论者在道德上比宗教人士更好

693
00:33:01,633 --> 00:33:08,100
我现在不是说我也把自己定义为基督教无神论者等等

694
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,633
但你知道 如果有所谓的教训 尤其是来自过去的、历史的教训

695
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:19,166
那（这个教训）就是上帝 那个所谓的激励我们的上帝

696
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:30,866
当我们提到宗教时 也可以容易地将它用来为（甚至是）强加的邪恶行为辩护

697
00:33:31,366 --> 00:33:38,266
是哪位宇宙学家写了一本叫做《前三秒钟》的书 不是温伯格

698
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,566
我认为他说了一些精彩的话

699
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:41,866
你会感到震惊

700
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:48,100
他说 没有宗教 好人会做好事 坏人会做坏事

701
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:56,133
但你需要像宗教这样的东西 才能让本质上是好人的人做出坏的、可怕的事情

702
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:04,600
我并不是说这是宗教的终极真理 但这也是其中一个方面

703
00:34:04,933 --> 00:34:08,866
首先 当我们谈论冥想、佛教等时

704
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:19,366
请不要忘记 佛陀 原来的那个人 如果不是无神论者 至少是个不可知论者

705
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,566
他明确表示 上帝 这和我无关

706
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,266
其次 非常快地 我的最后一点

707
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:38,366
当我们谈论宗教的有效性等等 但不管怎样 你知道

708
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:46,166
我同意你的观点 它不能解释一切科学 而且偶尔的 好科学家通常知道这一点

709
00:34:46,233 --> 00:34:52,000
你已经指出了真正的科学和科学主义之间的关键区别

710
00:34:52,133 --> 00:35:00,566
我不知道你是否同意 但我会将像道金斯这样的人更多地归为科学主义

711
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:12,133
我和很多严肃的认知学家谈过他们告诉我 他更像纳粹德国人说的那样 是为了科学的宣传

712
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:13,400
他没有做真正的事情

713
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:20,866
但尽管如此 看 我的天啊 现代科学做了非常非常重要的事情

714
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:37,300
所以我仍然想反对这种新的后现代历史主义方式 哦 科学只是另一种话语 它有一个局限于它之中的真理观念 等等

715
00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:45,000
好的鲁珀特 在你回应之前 我希望你也能引导我们进入下一个主题

716
00:35:45,033 --> 00:35:54,966
所以下一代会比我们更具有宗教性 还是反之呢 因为我们时间不多了

717
00:35:54,966 --> 00:36:01,500
我认为宗教最终是基于直接经验 你可以称之为神秘体验

718
00:36:01,533 --> 00:36:10,733
许多人在大自然中自发地拥有这些体验 一些人通过濒死体验拥有这些体验 一些人通过迷幻体验拥有这些体验

719
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:22,033
一些人是通过有意识地进行精神实践 如冥想、祷告、禁食或其他实践的结果拥有这些体验

720
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:36,800
有许多精神实践 （会产生）我们的意识与一个巨大得多的意识连接的感觉 对于有过这种体验的人来说 不是一个理论 而是一种经验

721
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:39,333
我自己就有过这样的体验

722
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:49,933
我是一位实践的基督徒 之所以这样 一个原因是我实际上有过直接的体验 这些体验让我相信存在着超越我们自己的意识

723
00:36:49,966 --> 00:36:58,666
它不仅仅是神学中的一个理论或命题 而是我实际有过的体验 对我来说非常有说服力

724
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:07,933
现在我知道无神论者和唯物论者会说 这只是大脑中多巴胺的释放或类似的东西

725
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,533
或大脑的各个部分的连接 这一切都只是在头脑中而已

726
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:19,933
但事实是 当你有了这些体验时 你是基于体验本身在行动

727
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:23,166
我的意思是科学应该是基于经验的 这意味着体验

728
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:31,100
这是体验 反对它的时候 你不是用唯物主义科学反对体验 你是用意识形态反对

729
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,000
即这个意识形态 思想不过是大脑（的活动）

730
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,333
现在 我认为 对任何有过神秘体验的人来说 那种意识形态的局限性都非常清楚

731
00:37:42,366 --> 00:37:54,266
并且越来越多的人正在拥有这些体验 部分是因为迷幻药物的传播 对许多人来说 它们是通往更广阔意识视野的一种成人礼

732
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:59,966
它们对我来说确实是这样 当我1971年左右首次尝试迷幻药物时

733
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,233
在那之前 我是一个无神论者 一个标准的与我的科学教育相符的唯物主义无神论者

734
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:17,666
而它们（迷幻药物）帮助我打开了思维 接受新的可能性 后来我开始练习冥想和瑜伽 因为我想在不使用药物的情况下探索意识领域

735
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:35,866
考虑到人类几千年来都有这些体验 考虑到这些体验是佛陀启蒙的基础 那是一种直接的体验

736
00:38:35,866 --> 00:38:46,400
耶稣感受到与上帝的亲近 并不是因为他获得了博士学位或去了犹太教神学院 而是一种直接的体验

737
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,200
这些类型的体验不会消失

738
00:38:50,500 --> 00:39:04,566
对于那些有过这些体验的人来说 它们极其有意义 比阅读流行科学书籍或者尝试用大脑缺氧等来解释濒死体验的人更有意义

739
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:15,833
我认为 因此 这些体验很可能会导致人们持续对精神实践产生兴趣 而这些精神实践很可能会导致与宗教传统的联系再次增强

740
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:27,166
因为如果没有植根于某种传统 也没有植根于某个社群 那么人们只是漂浮不定的

741
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:39,533
宗教为人们提供了许多东西 但它们也提供了一种与其他人在社区中的互联感 这是碎片化的个人主义所不具备的

742
00:39:39,533 --> 00:39:45,533
所以我个人的观点是 宗教很可能会进化 正如珍妮弗所说

743
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:49,100
她很精彩地描述了这个进化过程的方式

744
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,700
我认为它们将继续进化

745
00:39:50,733 --> 00:39:54,033
它们正在我们眼前进化

746
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:58,966
许多人将发现它们的价值

747
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:02,200
所以这是我对第三个问题的回答

748
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:11,633
听起来鲁珀特是在说 宗教的持久流行部分原因是我们需要某些东西

749
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:19,900
我们需要更多东西来避免成为碎片化的个体 问题是这种东西需要是宗教吗

750
00:40:19,933 --> 00:40:25,566
有没有其他的实践 其他的生活形式能做到这一点

751
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:31,266
或者说宗教有某种特别之处 只有宗教能满足这种需求

752
00:40:31,366 --> 00:40:33,133
那么这个问题会是 什么算作宗教

753
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,666
所以 很抱歉在这里提出了很多问题

754
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,800
但也许这能帮助推动辩论的剩余部分 在我们进行问答环节之前

755
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:46,733
我认为我想说的是 我确实在鲁珀特和斯拉沃热的言论中听到了 我很确定我听到斯拉沃热说--

756
00:40:47,933 --> 00:41:00,066
我不想替你们说话--但某种程度上 对宗教体验的渴望或冲动 从他们的视角来看 是一种深刻的人性

757
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:07,800
而我只想说 遗憾的是 在这方面 这场辩论会很无聊 因为我不会和他们有任何分歧

758
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:13,766
那就是我想表达的观点 它被称为许多不同的名字

759
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:17,033
荣格称之为宗教本能

760
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:23,066
维克多·弗兰克尔称之为人对意义的寻求

761
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,233
拉尔夫·沃尔多·爱默生称之为美丽的必然性

762
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:27,433
我们可以继续举例下去

763
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:38,700
但这种对某些东西的渴望 我认为是与我们可能称之为宗教的东西特有的 它超越了神学

764
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:43,033
它超越了认识论或真理所主张的

765
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:46,733
这是接着鲁珀特的话说

766
00:41:46,766 --> 00:41:48,200
它超越了机构

767
00:41:48,233 --> 00:41:57,100
它涉及某些类型的体验、情感、环境、神秘体验、惊奇和敬畏感

768
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:02,733
我认为这是我们一次又一次看到的

769
00:42:03,233 --> 00:42:12,100
无论唯物主义多么想解释掉它 或者至少它确实解释了它 但它存在

770
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,066
这将采取什么形式

771
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,733
我们拭目以待

772
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:26,700
我认为我们所知道的关于下一代的是 至少那些受过教育的人 他们清楚地意识到自己生活在我们所说的人类世中

773
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,500
他们还知道 他们从父母和祖父母那里继承的是 他们生活在借来的时间上

774
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:39,433
因此 我认为所有这些问题现在对下一代来说将具有特殊的紧迫性

775
00:42:40,466 --> 00:42:50,766
我不认为我们所说的科学或宗教对他们来说将足够--正如尼采所说--越过这深渊发射渴望之箭

776
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,933
我认为他们会从两者中汲取

777
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:02,566
但我认为那种渴望 那种向往 荣格所说的宗教本能是绝对深刻的人性

778
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,900
它可能会采取不同的形式 但我不认为它会消失

779
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:10,600
这就是我的看法 斯拉沃热 现在轮到你了

780
00:43:11,433 --> 00:43:14,266
好的 但你想要接过话题时就接过来 好吗

781
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:28,466
非常简短地 首先 对于那种观点 即宗教基于一种极为强烈的深刻--这里没有讽刺意图--直接体验的回应

782
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:31,100
但如果我错了请纠正我

783
00:43:31,733 --> 00:43:34,800
我读了一些文本 就像已经提到的

784
00:43:35,266 --> 00:43:44,300
我认为所谓的神经神学家声称--然后我读了神学家对他们的回应--

785
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:49,966
神经神学家声称通过对你的大脑做一些操作--别问我是什么--

786
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:59,400
他们可以触发某种你会确切体验为这种强烈的宗教体验的东西

787
00:43:59,866 --> 00:44:03,366
有趣的是 神学家对他们的回答是什么

788
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:09,766
因为这里似乎是一个很好的证据 （宗教体验）和你的内心生活无关

789
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,300
（如果）我以某种方式对你做 你就会有那种类型的体验

790
00:44:15,433 --> 00:44:24,466
但所有你提到的体验 鲁珀特 我很喜欢你的演讲 像佛陀的启蒙

791
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:33,933
在这里我很抱歉 佛陀的启蒙对原始佛教本身来说根本不是任何意义上的宗教体验

792
00:44:34,233 --> 00:44:40,666
它仅仅是对真实、现实、终极虚空等的体验

793
00:44:41,133 --> 00:44:42,433
而基督教的体验

794
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:50,333
我的天 我对此着迷 但对我来说 我在这里同意一些极端神学家的观点

795
00:44:50,866 --> 00:45:01,533
比如我最爱的20世纪的吉尔伯特·基思·切斯特顿 基督的基本体验是 父啊 父啊 为什么你离弃我

796
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:07,833
这正是与上帝分离的不可思议的强烈体验 这是我认为基督教独有的

797
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,666
我可以稍后再争论这个 对基督教来说是独特的

798
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:26,566
所以我仍然会更进一步认为我们的宗教体验 无论它多么强烈个人化 它都是历史形成的

799
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,333
我可以继续说... 例如 你怎么称呼它

800
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:39,366
十字架的约翰和特蕾莎 这两位中世纪的大神秘家 他们描述了一种非常不同的体验

801
00:45:39,433 --> 00:45:42,666
所以我会更倾向于这个方向 最后

802
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:53,533
是的 科学的极限是某种这样的体验 甚至是我所说的现实的不完整性

803
00:45:54,133 --> 00:45:59,966
但你看 我的观点不是... 让唯物论者来解释它

804
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:09,900
我认为这种破碎的体验 让我们称之为原初虚空 佛陀所经历的 对我来说 这是唯物主义的零度水平

805
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:15,266
你想要唯物主义 （那么）不要看机械主义的科学家 看看佛陀

806
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,966
嘿 谢谢斯拉沃热 感谢你们所有人

807
00:46:21,033 --> 00:46:22,400
谢谢鲁珀特 谢谢珍妮弗

808
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:23,633
谢谢

809
00:46:24,133 --> 00:46:25,066
非常感谢

810
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:25,866
谢谢
